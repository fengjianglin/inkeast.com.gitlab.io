 <p><strong>AST 820 - Di Qing’s tears </strong></p>
 <p>Looking at the nigh-invincible Earth Devouring Mouse, Qing Shui secretly felt very happy. This was Luan Luan’s demonic beast, and the Earth Devouring Mouse would have an extremely bright future.</p>
 <p>The main reason was because the Earth Devouring Mouse was a mutated demonic beast that had no limits to its growth. It could reach an extremely powerful stage, but there was no certainty as to whether it could break through to that point.</p>
 <p>There were many spiritual beasts in the world. Although in principle, all beasts had no limits to their growths, but the further they advanced, the probability of breaking through would become more uncertain. However, from the Earth Devouring Mouse’s speed of growth, it should not be garbage.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, two months had passed. Qing Ming and Qing Yin were able to walk with a little wobbling. The strength of the Qing Clan had all increased by a level after the two months.</p>
 <p>This was just the beginning, as the medicinal effects left within their bodies allowed them to achieve double the effects with half the effort. In addition, Qing Shui was able to solidify their cultivation foundation and wash their marrows with other pills, wines and gold needles with minimal effort.</p>
 <p>The ones who showed the most improvement were the third generation of the Qing Clan. All of them had broken through at least two stages. Qing Bei was now a Grade Four Martial King, Qing You a Grade Three Martial King, Qing Hu a Grade Nine Xiantian and Qing Jun a Grade Ten Xiantian</p>
 <p>Luan Luan’s improvement was the fastest. After Di Chen left, Yiye Jiange just happened to break through to Grade Three Marial Saint from Peak Grade Two Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue and Mingyue Gelou did not break through. In the past, Canghai Mingyue had already consumed the Beauty pill while Mingyue Gelou had reached Peak Grade Two Martial Saint but had yet to breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li had reached Peak Martial King with six countries of strength. She was already at the brink of being a Martial Saint and could breakthrough at any time. However, there was a small possibility that she might never breakthrough her entire life.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui decided to wait for a while. If she was truly unable to breakthrough, he would give her a Fate Pill. The next Mysterious Fruit was about to ripen, and he had decided to consume that fruit, leaving the remaining one to refine the Fate Pill.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang had broken through to become a Grade Two Martial Saint. Shi Qingzhuang had risen from Grade Three to Grade Six Martial King. This speed was already considered pretty fast, but Qing Shui felt that her increase in strength was still insufficient.</p>
 <p>However, Shi Qingzhuang was still just a Grade Six Martial King, and the room for improvement was very great. Furthermore, he also had methods to spur her growth. Overall, he was still very satisfied by the accomplishments of the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>His pills on top of their usual great effort during training had allowed them to attain those accomplishments. Compared to the Qing Clan, the improvement of the Heavenly Palace was much slower. However it was still faster than before. Yet, they were still incomparable to those supreme aristocratic clans and sects.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I want to go home.”</p>
 <p>Finding Qing Shui, who was currently training one day, Di Qing said these words to him.</p>
 <p>Di Chen had been gone for some time, but Di Qing had remained here all along. Qing Shui felt that he had truly neglected her a little during this period. Ever since she was splashed by cold water in front of him, there had been very few private moments between the two of them.</p>
 <p>She was a naturally arrogant woman. When had she been last disregarded like this, especially now it was by the only man she was close to and favorable impression of, yet the opposite party did not seem to like her. She had already tried her best, and had thickened her face and done what she could do. However, the result wasn’t to her expectations, and he did not express any feelings to her.</p>
 <p>After enough time had past, she felt staying here was just increasing her frustrations and she felt unwanted, hence she felt she should leave as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>After hearing that she wanted to leave, Qing Shui felt slightly guilty. Di Qing had not come to the Qing Clan because her elder sister was here, if not she would not have stay for so long after her elder sister had left.</p>
 <p>“After a period of time, I’ll also head to the Central Continent. Why don’t we head there together?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need. I miss home. I’ve already talked to Aunt and the rest. I’ll leave tomorrow.” Di Qing replied with a smile as she shook her head, her tone very firm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know what feeling he had towards Di Qing, and it was definitely not love. Perhaps it was due to Di Chen that he had considered her a very good friend. Currently, he could feel Di Qing’s disappointment, bitterness as well as her complicated feelings.</p>
 <p>If she truly loved him, Qing Shui guessed that she would definitely be in pain. This was because he knew that feeling, and also knew that everyone had their own sorrows.</p>
 <p>Now, he actually envied those romantics. If all comers were welcomed, perhaps he could also be very happy now...</p>
 <p>If he was truly that kind of person, the girls beside him now might not have existed.</p>
 <p>For a moment, Qing Shui did not know what to say. After pausing for a while, he said, “I’ll send you.”</p>
 <p>That sentence made Di Qing’s heart immediately sink. Qing Shui did not urge her to stay nor showed any expression. At that moment, her heart was in pain, as she knew that once she leaves this time round, there won’t be any chance of getting together with him.</p>
 <p>A relationship was like a double edged sword. If it was not grasped properly, both parties would be hurt.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” Di Qing replied with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>With this mention of thanks, Qing Shui suddenly felt the distance between him and Di Qing was slowly getting larger. Her current expression seemed to have returned to the time when she was the Huang Qing Sword Devil.</p>
 <p>At this moment, she was already no longer that slightly crafty and absolutely beautiful girl. She still looked as beautiful, but the craftiness and intimate look was already gone, once again returning to being a psychedelic, beautiful girl.</p>
 <p>Di Qing turned around and left. Qing Shui did not see the desolateness that emerged after that smile. The moment she walked out of the backyard, a clear teardrop fell from her eye.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, good bye. Since I can’t be your lover, I’ll just be a passerby then!” Wiping off the tears from her eyes, Di Qing regained her usual smile.</p>
 <p>Looking at Di Qing’s back, Qing Shui felt a little guilty. He did not know if he felt guilty for Di Qing or for Di Chen, perhaps it was a bit of both.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the second day, Qing Shui had still maintained his usual routine. Only when it was time for breakfast did he realise that Di Qing had not appeared. His heart suddenly skipped a beat and he promptly rushed to her room.</p>
 <p>Her room was already packed neatly, the bedding was tidied up neatly. The spotless room had a faint nice-smelling fragrance. However Qing Shui wasn’t in the mood for any of these. There was a letter above the tea table in the room.</p>
 <p>On it’s surface wrote three words, To Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rapidly tore it open and retrieved the silk letter.</p>
 <p>Opening it hurriedly, he rapidly read the letter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, when you’re reading this letter I’ll have already left. Don't chase after me. I’m alright. Besides, you won’t be able to find me. Don’t think too much about this. I love you, however you don’t love me.</p>
 <p>I assumed that by following by your side, you might change your view of me and will love me. I believed that I’m not inferior anyone. I love you. This is the first time I’ve loved a man in my life, yet I loved till I was covered all over in bruises.</p>
 <p>Don’t feel guilty. I’m alright. I’m very strong. I love your freedom and carefreeness. You also don’t like my carefreeness. Maybe this is what I’ve owed you in my previous life, and you’re my tormentor in my present life.</p>
 <p>You’re a good man. Although you’re slightly perverted, you’re true and genuine.</p>
 <p>Treat my elder sister well. The past few years for my elder sister were very painful. I’m leaving and would not trouble you any more in the future.</p>
 <p>Di Qing out!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment, before he rapidly exited the room. Saying a word to his family, he mounted the Fire Bird and rapidly flew into the skies. However, the skies were empty, with no sign of any familiar figure.</p>
 <p>Standing in mid air, Qing Shui did not know what he wanted to do. Even if he were to catch up, what would he do? Standing on the Fire Bird, he peered towards the distant east.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know how to regard this. Was he being indecisive? The current separation was also considered as a pretty good ending. However, Qing Shui had a gut feeling that if she leaves, there would always be regret in his heart.</p>
 <p>He did know what this feeling was. He knew that currently he did not love this girl.</p>
 <p>“I’ll gamble once, gamble once.” Qing Shui to muttered himself. He had decided to guess a direction before activating the Nine Continents Steps, seeing if he could catch up to Di Qing.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Di Qing mounted her Azure-eyed Silver Falcon which was much stronger than before. She had in fact placed the letter and left at 11pm the night before, flying towards the east. She currently felt that the Azure-eyed Silver Falcon’s speed was too fast, so much so that she wished it would fly a bit slower...</p>
 <p>Time after time again, she would uncontrollably take a look behind her. She had really hoped for that figure to show up. Once, twice, no matter how many times it was, the result was the same.</p>
 <p>Di Qing mockingly laughed at herself, “Di Qing ah Di Qing, He offered to send you, yet you rejected him. Why are you acting like this now.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, the sky had turned bright. Looking at the unknown distance that she had already covered, she shook her head. He should know that she had already left by now. It would be impossible to catch up to her. Besides, he should be more than eager for her to leave. Being tangled with a woman he did not like was very annoying...</p>
 <p>A bitter and astringent smile appeared on Di Qing’s face. She realised she learnt today how to laugh bitterly. When did she becoming so disappointing. The first time she had liked a person and had taken the initiative to chase him, and yet she ended in such regret.</p>
 <p>She already did not wish to look back. However after hesitating again and again, she told herself just one last time, one last time...</p>
 <p>Standing on the back of the Azure-eyed Silver Falcon, Di Qing slightly turned her head and glanced backward. It was still empty. She laughed bitterly as she shook her head, turning around and allowing the Azure-eyed Silver Falcon to rapidly increase its speed.</p>
 <p>However, just as she turned around, she was stupefied...</p>
 <p>In the distance, a giant fiery bird had stopped in midair, with the man of her dreams standing on it, giving her a faint smile.</p>
 <p>At that moment, she was unable to stop her nose from sniffing, as tears fell uncontrollably from her eyes.</p>
 <p>The Azure-eyed Silver Falcon had already flown to the front of the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stepped across the air, instantaneously appearing before Di Qing. That letter had made him understand her thoughts. He gambled once. If he managed to catch up to her, it meant that the two of them were bound by fate. He would try to interact with her and not reject her subconsciously. This was because he had thought about Di Qing’s words and he wanted to gamble on the fate between him and Di Qing.</p>
 <p>After choosing a direction, he immediately used the Nine Continent Steps. He was surrounded by wilderness upon arrival. Although there were the occasional beast hordes and flying demonic beasts passing by, there was no sign of that familiar figure.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui found that the distinct figure within his mind, he felt slightly panicky. Previously when he did not discover her in the surrounding area, he was dazed, pondering as he stood still.</p>
 <p>When he had finally prepared to leave, he raised his head, only to see the Azure-eyed Silver Falcon coming from the west. It turned out that his Nine Continents Steps had made him appear in front of her. At this instant, Qing Shui seemed to have made a decision.</p>
 <p>Especially when he saw Di Qing on the back of the Azure-eyed Silver Falcon, glancing backward for a long time, not wanting to turn her head back.</p>
 <p>“Why are you crying.” Qing Shui hesitated for a while before helping her wipe her tears, yet the more he wiped, the more tears came dripping down.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>With a shout, Di Qing immediately hugged Qing Shui lightly and started to sob. Her grieving appearance made Qing Shui’s heart hurt incomparably.</p>
