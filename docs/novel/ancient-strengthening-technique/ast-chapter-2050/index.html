 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, let's enjoy her together. That aside, the food here really doesn't taste bad. Why don't we have our fill before continuing? Didn't they say that when one is well fed, their sexual desires will rise? We'll be in a better mood after we have some food." The man called Young Master Zhan said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn't tell if they were arrogant or ignorant. To think that they were saying such shameless words in such manners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another man who was even younger than the other two. He didn't say a word nor, did he say that he would participate. It could be due to his status which was slightly lower than the other two or that he didn't have such interests. Just then, Young Master Pan spoke up, "Junior Martial Brother Song, do you want to join us?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Junior Martial Brother Song didn't seem to be used to this and shook his head, "I won't be joining in. Can the two of you be a little bit more restrained? If the women are willing then you can do it as it fits you. However, don't be forcing them. Why don't we forget about it today? It's better to have less trouble going after us."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Junior Martial Brother Song, it's rare for us to be able to come out. We need to relieve ourselves! We can only come out once in ten years and each time, it'd be only for two months. It's too stifling." Young Master Pan didn't seem to care much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"But if we were to create troubles, we won't be able to answer Master!" Junior Martial Brother Song said prudently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're underestimating us. No one would dare to offend us. Even if we were to go overboard, no one will do anything to us. This is a dog eats dog world and the weak must have their resolve. In this world, what matters is one's fist. We're just seeing whose fist is stronger." Young Master Pan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Junior Martial Brother Song didn't say any more. They would be heading back very soon, so he decided to let things be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What are you guys doing? Serve up the food!" Young Master Pan shouted loudly and ordered Qing Shui and Yu Xixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because right now, other than the five of them, only Qing Shui and Yu Xixuan remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We only allow and serve foods to humans here. We do not let animals in." Yu Xixuan said coldly. She had a great urge to kill them after hearing what they said had earlier, but chose not to take action immediately. She wanted to know who these people were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh, this lass is quite cool. We'll let you submit to us in a while and be our b*tch." Young Master Zhan laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"B*stard [1]!" The killing intent on Yu Xixuan's enraged face was even greater now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"B*stard? You'll know what a b*stard is soon. This must be your gigolo. He doesn't look bad. We'll let him watch from the side later." Young Master Shao laughed without any restraints, as if he didn't care for Yu Xixuan's curse. He felt comfortable even when glared by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I think that your mouth's obscene and despicable. You’re better not having it." Qing Shui no longer wanted to use amicable means to get his hands on the things he wanted. With a flash, he punched, targetting Young Master Zhan's mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pfft!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of Young Master Zhan's teeth shattered within moments and his mouth was filled with blood. However, his life wasn't at risk despite the intense pain that had caused him to fall unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Speak up. Who are you?" Qing Shui asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although one of them had been knocked out, they didn't do anything out of hand and remained calm. The Young Master Zhan who had been beaten up earlier was actually not very strong, so they didn't feel that Qing Shui was that amazing at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It doesn't matter who we are, but do you know who you've beaten up?" Young Master Pan asked, amused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't really need to know who someone of this caliber is. It wouldn’t be a big deal even if I were to kill him." Qing Shui said stoically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's calmness took Young Master by surprise. Junior Martial Brother Song suddenly said to Qing Shui, "He's from the Northern Blue's Zhan Clan. Even if everyone in the Azure Rainbow City were to come together, they wouldn't dare to go up against the Zhan Clan."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm asking who you guys are. You can choose to not answer. I'll have you end up in the same plight as him." Qing Shui was actually very surprised. The strongest circle in the Northern Blue was here... It would be a lie to say that Qing Shui wasn't concerned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha, you sure have guts. You guys would be seen as the bad side, not allowing people to enter when you've set up a restaurant. Moreover, you won't be able to lay a hand on us." Young Master Pan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, one of the two middle-aged men stepped out, “You've beaten up someone from the Zhan Clan. Even if we don't do anything to you right now, you won't be able to keep your life. Young man, you must use your brain when you're outside. Recklessness will only lead you to your death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was actually in a tight spot. These two middle-aged men were very powerful, and could even be compared against Little Rin. Their loftiness was about the same as Little Rin's, but their auras were more dangerous. Qing Shui had the feeling that Little Rin wouldn't be able to defeat one of the two men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was probably also due to the same reason that Young Master Pan and Junior Martial Brother Song seemed unfazed. They probably had never thought of taking any action since the strength that Qing Shui had used when he beat up Young Master Zhan was ordinary. It would be too easy for the two of them to interfere so they chose not to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Qing Shui knew that they would leave the trouble to the Zhan Clan and let them deal with him. They probably either believed that Qing Shui wasn’t worthy of being their enemies or there were some other reasons. For example, it might be that they couldn't kill people for no reason. Otherwise, they would have taken actions a long time ago. Of course, it could also be that they were waiting for him to take actions instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't want to make a move at the moment. With Long Zhu`er and the Dragon Slaying Beast, he should be able to make it so that they wouldn’t be able to leave. However, what would happen thereafter? There must be a powerful influence behind these people. It was very hard right for him to go up against them, and he might lose everything he had here. Qing Shui didn't want to end up like a loser, nor did he wish to push the Yu Clan [2] into a pit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's leave and bring Young Master Zhan along with us." Young Master Pan sneered and said to the other two middle-aged men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wouldn't it be letting you off too easily when you simply leave just like that after smashing up my place?" Qing Shui stopped Young Master Pan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? Then what do you suggest we do? We've already smashed up the place. Do you want us to turn it back for you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It can't be smashed for nothing. I'll just give you a few jabs with my needles." After saying that, Qing Shui moved with a flash, holding a gold needle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're being atrocious!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two middle-aged men couldn't hold it in any further and dashed toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't attempt to dodge at all as he threw the gold needle in his hand so fast that one couldn't see it clearly.</span></p>

This was their ordinary attack and Qing Shui's defenses weren't lower than their attack. It was a pity that he was pushed back and sent knocking into quite a number of the restaurant's facilities. He appeared to be in a terrible plight.</span></p>

One of the middle-aged men was breaking out in sweat, looking at Qing Shui with eyes that seemed as if flames were going to spurt out from them. To think that they were dealt a sly attack under his watch.</span></p>
