 <p><strong>AST 944 - Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frog, Arrival at the Central Continent</strong></p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw what these people were like, he had no intentions of letting them off. Moreover, these people were from the Marionette Sect, making Qing Shui feel that it was even more reason for him not to let them off.</p>
 <p>These people were considered top notch warriors and would be in the limelight no matter where they went. It was a pity that the population in the world of the nine continents was too great and thus no matter how strong one was, there would always be someone out there who was stronger. Even though they were strong, there were quite a number of warriors who were at their level. This was also something which Qing Shui had only realized after becoming one of those who was at the Martial Emperor level.</p>
 <p>If one wasn't of this level, it would be hard for him to come into contact with the events that would occur to the people of this level.</p>
 <p>Yu He's expression was cold, not saying a word. She knew that Qing Shui wouldn't let them off, therefore she had no plans to make a move. These people really didn't think much about the two of them.</p>
 <p>"Everyone attack together! After we kill this fellow, that woman will be ours!" The 3rd Brother saw that things couldn't be settled easily. When dealing with people who could launch spiritual attacks, they would need to not give the opponent any chance to attack and to kill him directly. It was because people with strong spirit energy tended to have weak physiques.</p>
 <p>It might be because this was a means of balancing with the spirit energy.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that Qing Shui was an exception.</p>
 <p>Looking at the people who were charging over, Qing Shui took in a deep breath and stomped down.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's physical strength had reached 90 stars and the Mighty Elephant Stomp which had reached the great perfection stage now gave him a strength of 900 stars. These before him were unable to take this attack. Before this tremendous attacking prowess, they were taken aback and had no other choice but to scatter off in all directions.</p>
 <p>However, other than the five people in the lead, the others couldn't even escape. The tremendous explosion caused them to be turned into dust, created a deep crater in the ground and dust to be flown all over. Those who were hit had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Even though the five of them were able to escape, they weren't able to get off completely unscathed. Two of them suffered from serious injuries. If Qing Shui were to let them off, they would naturally be able to escape. However, Qing Shui wouldn't do that. He wasn't that much of an idiot...</p>
 <p>There were also three people who were flabbergasted and attempted to escape without any hesitation. How could Qing Shui let them off? He shot out two ordinary Coldsteel Beads.</p>
 <p>This was sufficient to deal with people of their level. With a flash, by the time the two Coldsteel Beads went through their two heads, Qing Shui had already caught up to the last person. This guy with a burly build was the guy who was called 3rd Brother.</p>
 <p>The primordial flames in Qing Shui's hand turned into a Primordial Flame Whip and he lashed it out.</p>
 <p>"Don't kill me..."</p>
 <p>It was a pity that he hadn't even finished his words before he was killed by Qing Shui's Primordial Flame Whip. These people deserved this fate, since those who committed too many sins would only end up dead. People like them would end up in a horrible state.</p>
 <p>Even if he didn't kill them today, someone else might do it. It was just that if they were lucky enough, they might be able to live through their lives safely. After all, with their strength ordinary people would have to shun them...</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again used a Mighty Elephant Stomp to turn the surroundings into debris before he gradually walked toward Yu He. These people were considered to have been buried.When people died, nothing was left.</p>
 <p>"Let's continue on our way for a little further!" Yu He looked at the surroundings and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"Alright!" Qing Shui and Yu He once again advanced on the Fire Bird. They had used up both uses of the Nine Continents Steps earlier.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Three days later, Qing Shui and Yu He truly entered the most central spot between the two continents. This was also the most dangerous spot. Qing Shui wasn't very worried. He had yet to use the Nine Continents Steps and if worst came to worst, he could just escape with Yu He.</p>
 <p>Recently, they had started to come across groups of demonic beasts. However, it was still quite manageable since he activated his Roc's Might and there was also the Fire Bird's pressure. Ordinary flocks of flying beasts wouldn't dare to get near.</p>
 <p>However, there were also exceptions. When they come across groups of large-scale ferocious flying beasts, Qing Shui and Yu He could only hide temporarily or choose to land. There were many places where they could hide on the ground and if it didn't work, they would escape on the Fire Bird. Those ferocious flying beasts wouldn't be able to do anything to them.</p>
 <p>Gu!</p>
 <p>Gu...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly heard a series of piercing cries which were both like cries from frogs and crows, but just sounded worse. Suddenly, from their left side a group of densely packed dots appeared in the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned. This was the fourth time today, but this time around those black spots were moving very quickly. Very soon, Qing Shui's expression changed slightly. Even Yu He was shocked and appeared slightly unnatural.</p>
 <p>Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frog！</p>
 <p>These creatures were not very big, but were still about three meters in size. Their bodies were like flames and they looked like burning toads. However, it was a pity that they were too big. They looked like frogs but yet had wings. Their bodies were tough as steel and like the Blood-Thirsty Bald Eagles, they were proficient in the use of poison and fire.These Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frogs were even more terrifying because they could both fly and leap. Each time they leaped, it would be at least 300 meters...</p>
 <p>If they were to be targeted by a group like this, they would basically be goners, no matter if they were in the air or on land. It would be fine if there was just one of them, but there were countless of them now...</p>
 <p>The center of this wilderness was really extremely dangerous but Qing Shui had his Nine Continents Steps, so he wasn't too worried. Even Yu He wasn't that worried either.</p>
 <p>Gu gu...</p>
 <p>The Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frogs scattered out and surrounded Qing Shui. Seeing how arrogant these ugly creatures were, Qing Shui couldn't help but want to kill some of them.</p>
 <p>"Since you guys specialize in fire, then we'll see whose fire is stronger." Qing Shui thought to himself and let the Fire Bird fly at great speed before he let the Fire Bird take another Gale Pellet.</p>
 <p>Usually, when they were traveling the Fire Bird would tend to take some Gale Pellets if the situation allowed it to. This would allow them to travel faster. However, the prerequisite was that the number of times it took the Gale Pellets didn't exceed the Fire Bird's limits.</p>
 <p>Even if medicinal pills could allow a temporary increase, it wasn't impossible to do so without any limits. The temporary improvement would cause a strain on the body and it was necessary for it to take sufficient rest. Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, so basically, it was as if it had taken one Gale Pellet once every 100 days.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Qing Shui's hands condensed two Primordial Flame Balls that were the size of the heads of two children. He continued to condense them, as he looked toward the densely packed group of Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frogs.</p>
 <p>Duo-Star Explosion！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui threw the two Primordial Flame Balls which were as quick as lightning, instantly killing many of them. That short moment of outlash and the black hole that was created formed a strange wave of power, swallowing up tens of the Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frogs in the area. The sparks from the explosion also had tremendous prowess, with the sparks having a terrifying penetrating power. Adding on to its terrifying high temperature, many of them were burned to ash.</p>
 <p>Those who were unlucky enough to have their brain penetrated would die instantly. The same went for those whose Core or heart were penetrated...</p>
 <p>In this moment, an empty space was created from the explosion.</p>
 <p>There were many horrifying cries and many of them plunged.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let the speed of the Fire Bird remain constant and allowed a number of the Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frogs to be able to catch up to him. The limits to his Primordial Flame Whip was 50 meters and he didn't wish to take any risks since there were many of them. He didn't wish to let them get within a 50 meter range of him, especially when Yu He was next to him.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he used the Primordial Flame Balls, Roc's Might and Buddha's True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Each time he used the Roc's Might and Buddha's True Eyes, he would only be able to kill one of them. These Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frogs were all high level Martial Saints and were not able to withstand Qing Shui's attacks. After all, Qing Shui's spirit energy was considerably strong.</p>
 <p>Seeing that he had done sufficient damage, Qing Shui then picked up Yu He, put away the Fire Bird and disappeared by using the Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>The Scarlet Flame Flying Heavenly Frogs were demonic beasts who didn't fear death. As long as it was a live creature, they wouldn't care how strong it was. They would just charge on forward until they've eaten their target.</p>
 <p>"These desolate beasts are so scary. If I were to be escaping alone, it’d take a lot out of me," Yu He smiled and said after arriving at a new location.</p>
 <p>"Thank goodness these creatures aren't very strong. Otherwise, they would be really terrifying, no matter if it's in the air, on the land or in the water." Qing Shui hadn't expected a powerful toad to be so terrifying just from growing a pair of wings.</p>
 <p>"Your treasure is really powerful. It's a pity that the skill can only be used twice everyday. Otherwise, it would only take a little while to reach wherever you want to go." Yu He seemed to be exceptionally happy.</p>
 <p>"A man who is content will feel happy. I'm content with it right now. As it is, it can still save me quite a lot of time."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, look, it's Sky City. We've finally arrived at Central Continent," Yu He looked at the city far away and said happily.</p>
 <p>On the way here, there were clouds in the sky and they didn't see Sky City. However, there was not a single cloud in the sky today and Sky City seemed to be flickering, appearing very majestic.</p>
 <p>They had spent a lot of time on this journey ever since they first left after the new year. It had already been three months, but the temperature was slightly warmer as they moved toward the Central Continent. Of course, there were still exceptions, such as Cold Ice City which was winter all year round and would snow every few days.</p>
 <p>Mmm, thinking of Cold Ice City, Qing Shui thought of Hai Dongqing again.</p>
 <p>"Let's find a place to stop, have some food and get some rest." Seeing that they were about to reach the Sky City, Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Although they had been in the wild for the past few days, they had tents and Qing Shui had even prepared a bed for Yu He. They had good food and good sleep. Furthermore, both of them were very strong and didn't feel tired. Even if they did feel tired, it would be more mental fatigue.</p>
 <p>At the mention of looking for a place to stay, they thought of the Octagon Inn. Back then, he had dealt them a great blow and he wondered whether they had rebuilt the place or had they moved out of this area.</p>
 <p>After arriving at Central Continent, Yu He took out something that was similar to a firework and lit it up. Although Qing Shui felt a little puzzled, he knew that she was informing someone.</p>
 <p>The Octagon Inn hadn't been rebuilt and there was nothing but ruins there. The fact that the place had fallen, even if it was by the hands of others, went to say that this place was an unlucky spot. Those who were rich wouldn't choose this location, yet the poor wouldn't be able to afford it, thus it was now empty. The Marionette Sect wouldn't care about just leaving this place alone. However, it was a pity that in the past, the Octagon Inn's daily revenue was really quite significant.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Cloud Pavilion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yu He moved a few streets away and stopped before this inn. It wouldn't lose out to the Octagon Inn from the past and could even be said to be even more luxurious.</p>
 <p>"Let's decide on this place!" Qing Shui looked at the sign and thought to himself.</p>
 <p>"Alright, we'll do as you say."</p>
 <p>Hearing Yu He's words, Qing Shui smiled, feeling something strange growing in his heart. During their journey, Yu He had often used this tone with him, being like a docile lady. However, she was actually a dignified, strong and mature lady who was an unrivaled beauty.</p>
 <p>The decor of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion wasn't as luxurious as the Octagon Inn, but it appeared majestic. It was something one could clearly sense upon entering. There were engravings on the walls and even the wall paintings would be demonic beasts or cultivators. The color scheme of the place wasn't bright but it was clean and grand looking, having a gracefulness compared to other places which had only the luxurious image.</p>
