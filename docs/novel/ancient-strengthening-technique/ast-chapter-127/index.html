  <p><strong>AST 0127 -Magnificently Slaying Trash</strong></p>
  <p>“You’re merely a single Xiantian cultivator! You must be courting death!”</p>
  <p>The words of Qing Shui caused the middle-aged man to gaze at him with astonishment in his eyes. He discovered that the eyes of Qing Shui were extremely clear, and the middle-aged man even felt a sense of wanting to avoid Qing Shui’s gaze.</p>
  <p>He found this notion to be exceedingly laughable. With heavy steps filled with strength, the middle-aged man slowly walked towards Qing Shui as a cruel smile was displayed on his face.</p>
  <p>This was because he knew that this exquisite looking young man filled with charm was his target this time around. As long as he could kill this youth off, then it could be considered that he had accomplished his mission. Just thinking of that, caused his lips to curl up, revealing rows of snowy white teeth. This causing the ordinary looking face of the middle-aged man to be somewhat more striking.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, don’t be rash!” Qing Luo called out, trying to halt Qing Shui who had already taken two steps forwards. Qing Luo felt extremely wretched and helpless, as he had seen his son almost get beaten to death.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, he is at least at the 2nd grade of Xiantian. Are you confident you can beat him?” Yu Donghao furrowed his brows as he looked towards Qing Shui. He knew that Qing Shui was proficient in a plethora of strange techniques. He still didn’t know how he had managed to kill Bai Zhong.</p>
  <p>The words of Yu Donghao, caused the surrounding people, including the Qing Clan members to be flabbergasted. If Yu Donghao were not at the Xiantian level, the people there would most likely be treating him like a madman.</p>
  <p>Qing Yi didn’t say anything, but she was tightly clutching Qing Shui’s hands. Feeling anguish in her heart, her elder brother had already been so grievously injured. Now if her son really went up, wouldn’t that merely increase the number of casualties?</p>
  <p>“Mother dearest, believe in me. I don’t joke around with my life. Killing him isn’t a problem at all.” Qing Shui smiled as he looked to Qing Yi, and after which, he also nodded in reassurance to Yu Donghao.</p>
  <p>If it were not for the rules of the arena, a few of the other red-eyed Qing Clan 3rd generation members would have rushed up to try to kill the opponent. Qing Shan was shouting in anger with tears in his eyes. How could he not feel anguish when he saw that his Father had been beaten up so badly.</p>
  <p>Qing Yi gazed at Qing Shui with a complicated feeling in her eyes. She realized that her son was getting more and more mysterious, and she couldn’t see through him anymore. Despite this, the motherly love she had for him remained unchanged.</p>
  <p>She slowly relinquished her hold of Qing Shui’s hand, and Qing Shui smiled in response, before turning his body and walking towards the arena.</p>
  <p>Everyone in the crowd with the exception of the Wenren sisters all stared at Qing Shui incredulously. Was he seeking death? They had no way to understand what Qing Shui was trying to do. If they had known that Qing Shui wanted to enter the arena, many would have found it unbelievable.</p>
  <p>The atmosphere had turned silent, the rowdy crowd didn’t even dare to breathe loudly. The worried eyes of Qing Yi couldn’t help but tear up as she regarded the back of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Yi silently gazed at the back of Qing Shui. The weak and little boy that had been unable to cultivate had finally matured, and even became the pillar of the Qing Clan today. That pitiful back view of the child from back then, had already become so tall and awe inspiring…</p>
  <p>Standing opposite of the middle-aged man, Qing Shui stared at his ordinary face. “Today, not only will you die, but I will also find out who instigated you into doing this. In the future, I will be sure to pay them a visit.”</p>
  <p>“Little boy, today you should first consider whether you will survive.”</p>
  <p>The middle-aged man cruelly laughed, as he repeated his earlier strike, sending a fist over to Qing Shui. The bloodlust in his eyes flickered intensely as his lips curled up in an unpleasant looking smile.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui half-clenched his fist. Now that Qing Shui had already broken through to the 4th Heavenly Layer, it could truly be said that he has shed his mortal body and transcended into a higher realm. Previously at the peak of the 3rd Heavenly Layer, his level of power was equivalent to someone at the peak of Houtian. After he had broken through, and after some time of stabilizing his power, his current power was equal to someone at the 4th grade of Xiantian. For cultivators in the 1st three grades of Xiantian, Qing Shui could care less about them.</p>
  <p>As he watched the fist that could pulverize a peak of Houtian into mincemeat approaching, he couldn’t help but think how tiny and weak it felt. The power level of Qing Shui before and after his breakthrough was comparable to the difference between the intensity of light between a firefly and the moon.</p>
  <p>Initially, as the fist approached, Qing Shui had wanted to use the Solitary Rapid Fist technique to smash his opponent to death, but thinking again he realized that this was a good opportunity to showcase to the world that from this moment onwards, the Qing Clan also possessed a Xiantian Cultivator!</p>
  <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique frenziedly circulated, transferring all the strength in his body to both his arms, Qing Shui blasted out with his full power at the middled-aged man that was still smiling cruelly while he was rushing at him. Even in death, Qing Shui also wanted the middle-aged man to die with with a grievance.</p>
  <p>In an instant, approximately 25,000 jin of tremendous strength felt akin to the pressure of a majestic mountain.</p>
  <p>The eyes of the middle-aged man grew as round as saucers. Instantly, panic, depression and incredulity could be seen in them!</p>
  <p>“Peng!” A loud sound echoed out, the impact created even caused part of the arena to be broken off. There was no longer any traces of the middle-aged Xiantian Cultivator. All that could be seen floating in the air, was a mist of blood.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stood unmoving on the arena. His lanky figure resembled a towering mountain!</p>
  <p>The surroundings were so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.</p>
  <p>“Isn’t that an insta-kill?”</p>
  <p>It was not known who said those words.</p>
  <p>Moments later, chaos erupted underneath the arena. The 3rd generation of the Qing Clan excitedly cheered as they rushed towards Qing Shui and surrounded him. In their eyes, worship and awe could be seen.</p>
  <p>“Strong, you are really too strong!” Yu Donghao said in amazement, as though he just woken up from shock.</p>
  <p>“Qing He couldn’t even block a single strike. But after Qing Shui’s attack, not even a speck of dust could be seen remaining from that middle-aged man. What exactly is the level of Qing Shui’s strength?” The rest of the clans from Hundred Miles City asked each other incredulously.</p>
  <p>Members of the Situ Clan had exceptionally ugly expressions on their faces. Especially after the earlier words from Situ Ba. Didn’t that make him akin to a clown now?</p>
  <p>Qing Yi heaved a sigh in relief, as tears of joy flooded her face. In this instant, only pride remained in her heart.</p>
  <p>The old master of the Shi Clan didn’t even say a single word, as he stared mutely at Qing Shui, thinking in his heart that the rumors about this little fellow and his granddaughter. Should things be made clear?</p>
  <p>“Okay, it’s my turn to stand up on the arena. You guys go ahead and get busy with your duties, the wedding preparations for brother Qing Zi still haven’t been completed yet!” Qing Shui bitterly smiled as he glanced around.</p>
  <p>“Why are you still going to stand in the arena? Do you think there would still be blind idiots coming to challenge you? This time around, those that thought our Qing Clan is easy to bully, you’ve already shown them how magnificently you take out the trash.” Qing You’s eyes flickered with a brilliant light.</p>
  <p>After the Situ Clan heard his words, they could only suppress their anger and smile bitterly!</p>
  <p>The wedding banquet continued, but no one dared to step onto the arena anymore. How would anyone still want to fight? A Xiantian cultivator was vaporized into a mist of blood by a single strike. Many women, young girls, young married women, milfs, all fluttered their beautiful eyelashes as they looked at Qing Shui. In their eyes, were admiration, curiosity, and even worship.</p>
  <p>Using the treatment of Qing He as an excuse, Qing Shui embarrassedly retreated from the multitude of gazes. Despite so, the wedding still had to continue.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui unintentionally spotted Feng Wuxi1. The face of this woman seemed to glow with the beauty of moonlight, and the radiance of sunlight. Flirtatiously glancing at Qing Shui, her eyelashes fluttered incessantly. Qing Shui saw that Feng Wuxi was mysteriously laughing at him, causing him to be at a loss for words. As the sound of her flirtatious laughter rang out, Qing Shui knew that not even those older man with tons of experience would be able to withstand her charms.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui thought about the fight as he walked towards the side. That middle-aged man was too careless, and did not have the chance to utilize his entire strength. When he felt that he was danger, it was already too late, and he couldn’t change his fate, thus he had died with regret.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui glanced at his hands which were as white as jade. These hands had saved two Xiantian cultivators, but at the same time had also killed two Xiantian cultivators. The only two human lives he had taken were actually both at the Xiantian level.</p>
  <p>After Qing Shui left, the atmosphere became more cordial. An everlasting grin was plastered on the kind old face of Qing Luo. Even Situ Nantian was forcibly dragged by Qing Luo to drink several cups of wine with him.</p>
  <p>Feng Wuxi felt that marrying Feng Yanfei to the Qing Clan was the correct decision, seeing how passionate Qing Shui was and how much he valued kinship. What a pity that there were no other girls in the Feng Clan that were able to be matched with Qing Shui. Xishui that lass…… had a personality that was too cold!</p>
  <p>The wedding continued all the way till evening, before the crowd dispersed. Both the groom and bride were already on their way to their new home, as the younger generations started to crowd around, playing pranks on them.2</p>
  <p>In the new house.</p>
  <p>Qing Zi laughed uproariously as Feng Yanfei called him a great stupid bear, causing the younger generation to burst out into laughter. Qing Shui couldn’t help but be reminded of beauty and the beast as he stared at Qing Zi with his new hot sister-in-law, Feng Yanfei.</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Zi, you must work hard tonight ah. Make sure you earn back the price of the dowry” Qing Hui teased.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui glanced at Qing Hui, who was considered one of the most horny guys ever in the younger generation of the Qing Clan, as he laughed out loud as well.</p>
  <p>“Little brat, stop your nonsense!” Feng Yanfei shouted in mock anger.</p>
  <p>There was a scrumptious spread of delicious dishes laid out on the table inside the bedroom. All of the three generations of the Qing Clan were there.</p>
  <p>“Haha brother, this All Aspect Nutritious Soup, is what Qing Shui cooked for you. He said that after drinking this you would have the stamina to fight 3 great rounds of war with sister-in-law.” Qing You snickered.</p>
  <p>“F*ck, don’t involve me!” Qing Shui was a bit embarrassed when he heard his name. He didn’t think that Qing You would use him as a shield.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, even you wanted to prank me together with them.” Feng Yanfei angrily pouted.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could only smile awkwardly, and extended his hand to rap Qing You on his head, before continuing, “I can guarantee, the words Qing You said was true. This soup has a miraculous effect for males. I can guarantee that after tonight, brother Qing Zi would want to drink this turtle soup every night.”</p>
  <p>“Pu!” Qing You spat out the turtle soup in his mouth all over Qing Hui.</p>
  <p>“Wa, you can’t take it anymore? Qing You, look how muscular you are, but to think you couldn’t take it anymore after just drinking a mouthful……”</p>
  <p>Everyone roared in laughter, and after which, Qing Zi and his wife, drank the ‘exchange wine’3, before everyone departed, leaving for the Qing Clan Medical Store, giving the couple some personal time.</p>
  <p>After they returned to the Medical Store, the group of them realized that Qing Luo, and the rest of the 2nd generation elders were all there. They started to relax in the living room, as they chatted leisurely over cups of tea.</p>
  <p>“Everyone sit, today, let the three generations of our Qing Clan sit down and chat.” Qing Luo smiled.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that it would end up like this. Damn it, he would have to use cultivation as an excuse to sneak off later.</p>
  <p>“Shui gege, over here!” Qing Bei waved as she called out.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled as he sat down beside Qing Yi and Qing Bei.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, when did you break into Xiantian?” Qing Luo laughed happily as he regarded Qing Shui.</p>

 <p>Standing opposite of the middle-aged man, Qing Shui stared at his ordinary face. “Today, not only will you die, but I will also find out who instigated you into doing this. In the future, I will be sure to pay them a visit.”</p>
 <p>“Little boy, today you should first consider whether you will survive.”</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man cruelly laughed, as he repeated his earlier strike, sending a fist over to Qing Shui. The bloodlust in his eyes flickered intensely as his lips curled up in an unpleasant looking smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui half-clenched his fist. Now that Qing Shui had already broken through to the 4th Heavenly Layer, it could truly be said that he has shed his mortal body and transcended into a higher realm. Previously at the peak of the 3rd Heavenly Layer, his level of power was equivalent to someone at the peak of Houtian. After he had broken through, and after some time of stabilizing his power, his current power was equal to someone at the 4th grade of Xiantian. For cultivators in the 1st three grades of Xiantian, Qing Shui could care less about them.</p>
 <p>As he watched the fist that could pulverize a peak of Houtian into mincemeat approaching, he couldn’t help but think how tiny and weak it felt. The power level of Qing Shui before and after his breakthrough was comparable to the difference between the intensity of light between a firefly and the moon.</p>
 <p>Initially, as the fist approached, Qing Shui had wanted to use the Solitary Rapid Fist technique to smash his opponent to death, but thinking again he realized that this was a good opportunity to showcase to the world that from this moment onwards, the Qing Clan also possessed a Xiantian Cultivator!</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique frenziedly circulated, transferring all the strength in his body to both his arms, Qing Shui blasted out with his full power at the middled-aged man that was still smiling cruelly while he was rushing at him. Even in death, Qing Shui also wanted the middle-aged man to die with with a grievance.</p>
 <p>In an instant, approximately 25,000 jin of tremendous strength felt akin to the pressure of a majestic mountain.</p>
 <p>The eyes of the middle-aged man grew as round as saucers. Instantly, panic, depression and incredulity could be seen in them!</p>
 <p>“Peng!” A loud sound echoed out, the impact created even caused part of the arena to be broken off. There was no longer any traces of the middle-aged Xiantian Cultivator. All that could be seen floating in the air, was a mist of blood.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood unmoving on the arena. His lanky figure resembled a towering mountain!</p>
 <p>The surroundings were so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that an insta-kill?”</p>
 <p>It was not known who said those words.</p>
 <p>Moments later, chaos erupted underneath the arena. The 3rd generation of the Qing Clan excitedly cheered as they rushed towards Qing Shui and surrounded him. In their eyes, worship and awe could be seen.</p>
 <p>“Strong, you are really too strong!” Yu Donghao said in amazement, as though he just woken up from shock.</p>
 <p>“Qing He couldn’t even block a single strike. But after Qing Shui’s attack, not even a speck of dust could be seen remaining from that middle-aged man. What exactly is the level of Qing Shui’s strength?” The rest of the clans from Hundred Miles City asked each other incredulously.</p>
 <p>Members of the Situ Clan had exceptionally ugly expressions on their faces. Especially after the earlier words from Situ Ba. Didn’t that make him akin to a clown now?</p>
 <p>Qing Yi heaved a sigh in relief, as tears of joy flooded her face. In this instant, only pride remained in her heart.</p>
 <p>The old master of the Shi Clan didn’t even say a single word, as he stared mutely at Qing Shui, thinking in his heart that the rumors about this little fellow and his granddaughter. Should things be made clear?</p>
 <p>“Okay, it’s my turn to stand up on the arena. You guys go ahead and get busy with your duties, the wedding preparations for brother Qing Zi still haven’t been completed yet!” Qing Shui bitterly smiled as he glanced around.</p>
 <p>“Why are you still going to stand in the arena? Do you think there would still be blind idiots coming to challenge you? This time around, those that thought our Qing Clan is easy to bully, you’ve already shown them how magnificently you take out the trash.” Qing You’s eyes flickered with a brilliant light.</p>
 <p>After the Situ Clan heard his words, they could only suppress their anger and smile bitterly!</p>
 <p>The wedding banquet continued, but no one dared to step onto the arena anymore. How would anyone still want to fight? A Xiantian cultivator was vaporized into a mist of blood by a single strike. Many women, young girls, young married women, milfs, all fluttered their beautiful eyelashes as they looked at Qing Shui. In their eyes, were admiration, curiosity, and even worship.</p>
 <p>Using the treatment of Qing He as an excuse, Qing Shui embarrassedly retreated from the multitude of gazes. Despite so, the wedding still had to continue.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui unintentionally spotted Feng Wuxi1. The face of this woman seemed to glow with the beauty of moonlight, and the radiance of sunlight. Flirtatiously glancing at Qing Shui, her eyelashes fluttered incessantly. Qing Shui saw that Feng Wuxi was mysteriously laughing at him, causing him to be at a loss for words. As the sound of her flirtatious laughter rang out, Qing Shui knew that not even those older man with tons of experience would be able to withstand her charms.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about the fight as he walked towards the side. That middle-aged man was too careless, and did not have the chance to utilize his entire strength. When he felt that he was danger, it was already too late, and he couldn’t change his fate, thus he had died with regret.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui glanced at his hands which were as white as jade. These hands had saved two Xiantian cultivators, but at the same time had also killed two Xiantian cultivators. The only two human lives he had taken were actually both at the Xiantian level.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui left, the atmosphere became more cordial. An everlasting grin was plastered on the kind old face of Qing Luo. Even Situ Nantian was forcibly dragged by Qing Luo to drink several cups of wine with him.</p>
 <p>Feng Wuxi felt that marrying Feng Yanfei to the Qing Clan was the correct decision, seeing how passionate Qing Shui was and how much he valued kinship. What a pity that there were no other girls in the Feng Clan that were able to be matched with Qing Shui. Xishui that lass…… had a personality that was too cold!</p>
 <p>The wedding continued all the way till evening, before the crowd dispersed. Both the groom and bride were already on their way to their new home, as the younger generations started to crowd around, playing pranks on them.2</p>
 <p>In the new house.</p>
 <p>Qing Zi laughed uproariously as Feng Yanfei called him a great stupid bear, causing the younger generation to burst out into laughter. Qing Shui couldn’t help but be reminded of beauty and the beast as he stared at Qing Zi with his new hot sister-in-law, Feng Yanfei.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Zi, you must work hard tonight ah. Make sure you earn back the price of the dowry” Qing Hui teased.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui glanced at Qing Hui, who was considered one of the most horny guys ever in the younger generation of the Qing Clan, as he laughed out loud as well.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, stop your nonsense!” Feng Yanfei shouted in mock anger.</p>
 <p>There was a scrumptious spread of delicious dishes laid out on the table inside the bedroom. All of the three generations of the Qing Clan were there.</p>
 <p>“Haha brother, this All Aspect Nutritious Soup, is what Qing Shui cooked for you. He said that after drinking this you would have the stamina to fight 3 great rounds of war with sister-in-law.” Qing You snickered.</p>
 <p>“F*ck, don’t involve me!” Qing Shui was a bit embarrassed when he heard his name. He didn’t think that Qing You would use him as a shield.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, even you wanted to prank me together with them.” Feng Yanfei angrily pouted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could only smile awkwardly, and extended his hand to rap Qing You on his head, before continuing, “I can guarantee, the words Qing You said was true. This soup has a miraculous effect for males. I can guarantee that after tonight, brother Qing Zi would want to drink this turtle soup every night.”</p>
 <p>“Pu!” Qing You spat out the turtle soup in his mouth all over Qing Hui.</p>
 <p>“Wa, you can’t take it anymore? Qing You, look how muscular you are, but to think you couldn’t take it anymore after just drinking a mouthful……”</p>
 <p>Everyone roared in laughter, and after which, Qing Zi and his wife, drank the ‘exchange wine’3, before everyone departed, leaving for the Qing Clan Medical Store, giving the couple some personal time.</p>
 <p>After they returned to the Medical Store, the group of them realized that Qing Luo, and the rest of the 2nd generation elders were all there. They started to relax in the living room, as they chatted leisurely over cups of tea.</p>
 <p>“Everyone sit, today, let the three generations of our Qing Clan sit down and chat.” Qing Luo smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that it would end up like this. Damn it, he would have to use cultivation as an excuse to sneak off later.</p>
 <p>“Shui gege, over here!” Qing Bei waved as she called out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he sat down beside Qing Yi and Qing Bei.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, when did you break into Xiantian?” Qing Luo laughed happily as he regarded Qing Shui.</p>
