 <p><strong>AST 1090 - Beast Blood Tribe, To Kill Or Not To Kill</strong></p>
 <p>Among these people, Qing Shui realized that the people from the Lion King’s Ridge and Violet Dragon Mountain weren’t at the front but rather, at the back. From the look of things, it didn’t seem like they were the people who had started this incident. They were most likely only here to watch.</p>
 <p>The person who led them was a middle-aged man. However, there was a wave of violent energy hidden within his body. Although he wasn’t that old, his strength was extremely terrifying. His appearance was also very wild and as rough as a demonic beast.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, be careful. The leader is from a seclusive race among the aristocratic clans in the Northern Sacred Lu Continent. They are the Beast Blood Tribe that is the representative of the Northern Sacred Lu Continent.” Yiye Jiange warned.</p>
 <p>“The Beast Blood Tribe?” This was Qing Shui’s first time encountering this name. But after hearing it, Qing Shui realized that this man who stood before him indeed had a slight resemblance to that of a demonic beast.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. They are an ancient tribe. There is a trace or a little amount of Demonic Beast Bloodline within their body. However, their intelligence is not inferior to anyone. Furthermore, they are exceptionally strong and strongly advocate violence. Then also…..” Yiye Jiange trailed off.</p>
 <p>“Then what?” Qing Shui asked in puzzlement.</p>
 <p>“And then regardless of male or female, they have quite an appetite in that aspect……” Yiye Jiange whispered uncomfortably into Qing Shui’s ear. Her voice was trembling.</p>
 <p>Her soft voice slightly tickled Qing Shui’s ear. Yiye Jiange was still an inexperienced maiden. The fact that she had only said something like this to Qing Shui had quite a heavy impact towards him.</p>
 <p>She reached out and pinched Qing Shui angrily when she saw him spacing out a little. Only then did he laugh mischievously. It was extremely delightful for him to see those beautiful eyes behind the veil hiding from his gaze.</p>
 <p>“Hey kid, please stay away from that young lady.”</p>
 <p>A loud and slightly metallic voice rang out just when Qing Shui was about to say something. His unreasonable words were spoken with a righteous tone.</p>
 <p>“Why?” Qing Shui smiled at the wild and beastly man across him. The man was taller than the average men by more than a head and he had a well built body. On top of that, his gaze and aura were extremely sharp and incisive, just like a demonic beast. Ordinary people would feel fearful in their heart at the sight of them.</p>
 <p>There were about twenty of them while the rest were from other parties. Standing together, the Beast Blood Tribe stuck out like a sore thumb among the crowds. Most people would automatically put some distance between themselves and the Beast Blood Tribe.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was rendered speechless too. This leading man was really too domineering. It was to the point that Qing Shui lost the intention of arguing with him. He then casually responded to his question.</p>
 <p>“Because they are very beautiful. I like them very much.” The man replied with a smile too, though his smile was a little chilling.</p>
 <p>“You blocked my path for this reason? Then let me tell you this. We are leaving here and it’s best that you don’t bother me and my women.” Qing Shui said while shaking his head before he lifted his foot, preparing to leave.</p>
 <p>“Hold it right there. I don’t recall letting you leave. You better not leave.” The man spoke up once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned his head around to look at Yiye Jiange. “Is something wrong with their brain? Why is it so hard to communicate with them?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s voice wasn’t too soft, so it was clearly audible to everyone around them. Naturally, the man closest to Qing Shui had heard it too and a wild aura was instantly emitted from his entire body. He wasn’t the only one, the other people of the Beast Blood Tribe were also glaring at Qing Shui furiously, as if they were going to rip him apart in the very next moment.</p>
 <p>“They are not dumber than other people out there. They only advocate violence so if you can beat them down, not only will they not bear any grudges to you but you can even be friends with them.” Yiye Jiange hurriedly replied.</p>
 <p>“I couldn’t care less about being friends. It’ll be fine as long as they don’t bother me. Beating them doesn’t sound too easy.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked towards the leading man after he finished his sentence. His speed wasn’t too fast but his Qi aura was raised with every step he took. By the time he was about ten meters from the leading man, his aura was already akin to that of a lofty mountain.</p>
 <p>“Come, show me if the strength of the Beast Blood Tribe is domineering enough.” Qing Shui’s voice rang out as he bound this man with his spiritual sense.</p>
 <p>Although this man had the appearance of a middle-aged person, he seemed to be a little younger than that. Even so, Qing Shui could sense that the blood and bone in his body had already reached their middle age. However, they were still superior if compared to ordinary cultivators in their middle ages..</p>
 <p>“How delightful. But you better be sure of this. If you can’t beat me, I will be accepting your women without hesitation.” The man’s lips turned into a tight, straight line. A ruthless expression appeared on his face. He also appeared agitated and animalistic.</p>
 <p>“If you lose, then all these people here shall die.” Qing Shui shifted his gaze to the all of the forty to fifty people around the middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>The man’s thick eyebrows knitted together. “You should only talk about this after you have defeated me!”</p>
 <p>Two gigantic axes appeared in the man’s hands after he finished his sentence. The twin axes were fiery red in color. Each of them was about two meters long. The head of the axe was no less than a meter in size. Within its heaviness laid a wave of scorching aura that exuded impetuous explosive Qi.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a step forward as his right fist struck out violently.</p>
 <p>Sixth Wave Essence!</p>
 <p>The Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm only unleashed a palm imprint at the very beginning. To be more specific, this was the limit of Qing Shui’s understanding in the beginning. Now that he had become proficient with this type of Wave Essence, it had gained many dynamic forms since long ago.</p>
 <p>His fist flew towards the man with a powerful stream of Qi. The powerful stream of Qi streaked across the air as it flew towards the man with lightning speed.</p>
 <p>“Insignificant!”</p>
 <p>The red wave from the gigantic axe of the man streaked across and directly collided with the wave from Qing Shui’s fist.</p>
 <p>Condensation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s fist violently struck out once again. In a split second, a big golden fist emerged in front of his fist and it collided directly with the red wave of Qi that was rushing in his direction.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had experienced great improvements in terms of his knowledge of spirit energy while he was cultivating the Lion King’s Imprint and the Lion King’s Roar lately. His improvement this time had allowed him to have a breakthrough. This allowed his spirit energy to gain form, for example, Qing Shui was able to condense his spirit energy into the form of a fist to attack as he wished.</p>
 <p>This kind of breakthrough also required outstanding talent and opportunities. Over these past few days, he had been cultivating the Lion King’s Imprint every day in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The fact that condensed Qi in the form of a fist could further enhance the offensive power of his existing spirit energy was also something that he had come to comprehend without realizing it. Take someone who had 100 jin of strength that could move a 100 jin object as an example. Without using any methods, then this 100 jin of strength would be merely 100 jin of strength. But through the form of fists or some other methods, the strength of over 100 jin could be exhibited. This was the reason why Qing Shui had condensed his Qi to the form of a fist.</p>
 <p>This was actually the effect of battle techniques. They could further bring out the potential of one’s strength. Spiritual secret techniques, Buddha’s True Eyes and Lion King’s Roar all had this effect. However, spiritual secret techniques were rare. This golden fist that Qing Shui had condensed must not be underestimated. It could be considered as one of the basic spiritual battle techniques. Though it might be superficial, it could extend Qing Shui’s current spirit energy beyond its original capability.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The great tremor instantly caused a ring of explosive gas to form around them. Qing Shui could already tell this man’s strength from their clash just now. It was about 20,000 stars. For a middle-aged person like him, this could be considered a blessing from the heavens. On top of that, they were standing at the exit of the Ancient Ruins because this place allowed his strength to be exhibited at its highest potential.</p>
 <p>The man’s expression turned hard as he stared at Qing Shui in disbelief. From this single exchange, he could already tell that things could get troublesome today. He shifted his gaze towards the few beauties with heavenly fragrance behind him again.</p>
 <p>He didn’t believe that no one had ever thought of snatching the women behind this young man. There was only one reason as to why they were still able to remain standing behind him right now. That was because no one was able to snatch them away from him.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Qi aura bloomed the moment he used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and the countenance of the man suddenly changed greatly. He dropped the gigantic axes in his hands and frantically waved his hand at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect this turn of events either. It was normally a disgrace and a humiliation for a cultivator to do something like this. This could even hinder them from cultivation breakthroughs in the future.Yet this man appeared to feel normal. He didn’t seem to be uncomfortable at all. He was taking this as a competition, admitting his defeat when he realized that he couldn’t beat his opponent……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as if he had just punched cotton with his fist. But despite what the man had said earlier, all of them dropped their weapons. A cultivator who dropped their weapons would have already forfeited some of their dignity. ‘Not killing a cultivator who had dropped their weapon’ was an unwritten rule. Of course, it wasn't like they couldn’t be killed. Some wouldn’t consider this unwritten rule even if their enemies had dropped their weapon. Some evildoers also massacred the innocent frequently.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, they have some demonic beast blood running in the veins of their body, so there’s some special power in their mind. Lowering their head this once will not hinder their future improvements. They are just like demonic beasts who have simply fled. Also, it is impossible for them to cultivate the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.” Yiye Jiange said softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. So even though God had bestowed them many things, he had also taken away some things from them. This also allowed Qing Shui to understand why the Beast Blood Tribe was so formidable among the Five Continents. They started out at a much higher level than others. In the Five Continents, cultivators who could use the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation were among the best. Even so, the people in the Five Continents who could use the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation weren’t a bit superior to the Beast Blood Tribe.</p>
 <p>He looked at the person who had put down his weapon. He could be considered a barbarian. Qing Shui made his decision when he remembered the actions of all these people from earlier on and their beastly gaze. He directed an icy cold stare into the man’s eyes.</p>
 <p>He thought back to Qing Clan. By then, Qing Clan should be the most powerful clan among the Five Continents. Qing Shui’s heart calmed down when he thought about these things. But his piercing gaze was still affixed on the man.</p>
 <p>Buddha’s Piercing Eyes!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Roc's Might was gradually raised and his Buddha’s Piercing Eyes also gradually became more powerful!</p>
 <p>Spirit Bind!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spirit energy was enough to bind the middle-aged man after Qing Shui had performed the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestations. His formidable spirit energy was corrosive. It was corroding the middle-aged man’s very soul.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said that I’ll kill you all. Did you think that I was just joking?”</p>
 <p>His icy voice rang out. The trace of cruelty in his tone made many people’s hair stand on their end. It was followed by an overwhelming wave of pressure which was so intense that they could only crawl on the floor!</p>
 <p>Terror filled the man’s eyes. He was genuinely frightened this time. He had only experienced such terror from the elders of his tribe. They were a few of them and each of those elders were so old that it wouldn’t be a surprise if they left this world at any time. But this young man before him already possessed this kind of strength at his mere age. He couldn’t imagine how he terrifying this young man would be in the future…....</p>
 <p>He felt as if his brain was about to explode. He looked at Qing Shui pleadingly.</p>
 <p>KILL!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spirit energy rushed forth wildly!</p>
