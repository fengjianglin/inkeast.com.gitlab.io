 <p><strong>AST 742 - Unexpected Capture - Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable, Like A Tiger With Wings</strong></p>
 <p>With just one swift move, the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable had killed all the members of the Liu Clan in the area. Qing Shui had a sudden strong desire to have this Five-Colored Poison Beast as his own.</p>
 <p>He thought about the Five-Colored Poison Beasts that he had already owned. Inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the Five-Colored Daylily Pythons could be found swirling around the Five-Colored Daylily Grass. In contrast to the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable, the Pythons would normally attach themselves to the Five-Colored Daylily Grass instead of roaming around. Most importantly, the Five-Colored Daylily Pythons were still underage, unlike the fully-grown Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable in front of him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about how strong his two Five-Colored Daylily Pythons in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would become one day. Even then, he realized that their strength would still be quite weak in comparison with the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>The Five-Colored Daylily Pythons and the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable were from the same family of Five-Colored Poison Beast, but the difference in strength between the two species was quite huge. Of course, it would be inappropriate to compare the fully-grown Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable with the underage Five-Colored Daylily Pythons because of the difference in their ages.</p>
 <p>After all, the strength of a Poison Beast, like that of a demonic beast, would naturally come along with its age. The older it grew, the stronger its poison core and toxins would become. Moreover, the Five-Colored Daylily Pythons were known to be toxigenic. They needed the Five-Colored Daylily Grass in order constantly produce toxins in their body, which explained why they never stayed away from it for too long. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable, on the other hand, was one of the best among the Five-Colored Poison Beasts and could even be tamed as a powerful partner.</p>
 <p>Also, because Qing Shui had previously obtained an invaluable Flower of Life, he was eager to try capturing this particular Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable with his own ability.</p>
 <p>In this world, there weren’t many who could restrain a Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. The sables had soft flexible bodies that still had the toughness of a diamond. Each sable would have sharp teeth and claws that could easily pierce through sturdy metals like 1000-Year Coldsteel. The deadliest part, however, would be its poison and speed. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was essentially a tiger with wings attached.</p>
 <p>This kind of Poison Beast was definitely stronger than the spiritual beasts of the Heaven and Earth. Not only was the Five-Colored Daylily Python unable to stray away from the Daylily Grass for too long, it would need to attach itself to the user, like on the wrist, for an assault once it had been tamed.</p>
 <p>Luckily for Qing Shui, his Five-Colored Daylily Pythons were still at their weaker stage. Because of that, he had been able to use Nature Energy and the Pure Jade Pellet to resist their poison during the time he tried to capture them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn’t tamed his Five-Colored Daylily Pythons yet, because he needed them to produce toxins instead. Thus, when he saw the powerful Five-Color Poison Beast in front of him, he wanted to capture it as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>After the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable killed the remaining three people from the Liu Clan, it turned its gaze towards Qing Shui, focusing on its next victim. When Qing Shui knew what was happening, he stiffened. He feared that this Poison Beast would kill him before he even had a chance to capture it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already holding a Flower of Life as he fixed his gaze on the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. The sable, however, ignored his gaze and suddenly rushed towards him swiftly .</p>
 <p>“This Poison Beast still wants to attack me even though I’m holding a Flower of Life? So the Flower of Life didn’t matter?” Qing Shui quickly unleashed his Demon Binding Ropes as he focused on the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>He even quickly took out the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace as an extra precaution!</p>
 <p>If the Demon Binding Ropes didn’t work, he would have to use the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace to quickly imprison the Poison Beast. He had a feeling that the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace possessed the ability to frighten any demonic beasts that set its eyes upon it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s belief turned out to be correct. When the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable saw the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, it continuously let out an uncomfortable screeching. It quickly crawled on the ground as it looked at the furnace with fear in its eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui allowed himself to smile. The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was a good choice indeed, as the effect was quite strong. He hadn’t even used the furnace to trap the frightened beast, yet it had succumbed to fear and lay itself on the ground. If he were to use the furnace and imprison it, the sable would definitely struggle and be trapped inside the furnace until its death.</p>
 <p>“I can use the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace to scare the demonic beasts next time.” Qing Shui’s new discovery was unexpectedly delightful.</p>
 <p>He also found out that the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable didn’t really pay attention to the Flower of Life. Qing Shui saw a hint of yearning for the flower in the sable’s eyes, but also a hint of struggle.</p>
 <p>“Struggle?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was puzzled. Why did it struggle against the temptation of the Flower of Life? He remembered about the tale of the Flower of Life. A Poison Beast would be forever loyal to a person that managed to feed it a Flower of Life. Qing Shui had a vague feeling that it might be true after all.</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was a creature with the power of divine connection. Even if it were to swear its loyalty to someone, it would still need to observe the person’s true power. Qing Shui decided that he needed to prove his abilities to the sable in order to let it know how strong and capable he was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still uncertain, but he thought it was worth a try!</p>
 <p>Saintly Hands!</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly circulated every technique he had that could dispel any abnormal statuses then proceeded to consume a Pure Jade Pellet. He took out the Thunder God and rushed towards the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized that he wasn’t able to catch up to the sable’s speed, so he quickly consumed a Gale Pellet to increase his pace. Afterwards, he repetitively struck the ground with the Thunder God’s aura of destruction, hammering and shaking the whole mountain valley as he continued to display his strength.</p>
 <p>Screech screech!</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable evaded Qing Shui’s attack and looked at his Flower of Life while letting out a series of screeches. The nimble body of the Poison Beast jumped up and down as it screeched for joy.</p>
 <p>“You sly little thing.” Qing Shui was surprised by its change of behavior and unequipped his Thunder God. Then, he handed the Flower of Life to the sable, which took it with its front claws and consumed it in one bite.</p>
 <p>The bowl-sized Flower of Life was consumed by the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable in no time. Almost immediately, Qing Shui could feel a marvelous unique sensation throughout his body, as if there was a reaction between him and the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>The spirit beast had recognized its owner!</p>
 <p>This must be the feeling of being recognized by a spirit beast. Qing Shui turned to look at the sable’s gorgeous violet body and found it pleasing to his eyes. He wanted to touch it but decided against it, as the sable was full of poison.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was feeling perplexed, the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable glowed in a violet light for a few moments. The glow wasn’t because of a breakthrough, but rather it was a control that could stop its poison from spreading when it was touched. After the glow had died down, the sable seemed to grow more friendly with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui extended his hand to touch the sable, but the sable made the first move and quickly jumped onto Qing Shui’s body. The two-foot long sable was still huggable. In that few moments of interaction, Qing Shui’s heart was beating fast. Despite its extremely friendly actions, the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was, after all, a terrifying Poison Beast. He had the confidence that the sable would not poison him, but at the same time, he was terrified that he would be poisoned accidentally.</p>
 <p>“You little sable. Keep following me and you will have sumptuous meals all day and night.”</p>
 <p>Screech screech!</p>
 <p>When he looked at the nimble Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable, he felt that the dull days of waiting in this area had been worth his time. Just obtaining the sable alone trumped all the treasures of the entire Zuoshi Clan combined.</p>
 <p>After all, not all of the treasures in the Zuoshi Clan’s storage would be valuable. The chances of finding a live beast were basically zero. Moreover, the most valuable treasures, like the Divine Artifact, would not be recklessly placed inside the treasure storage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t put too much hope in the items stored inside the treasure storage after considering what could actually be in it. Moreover, it seemed that treasure storages were often quite dangerous and trap-laden. However, Zuoshi Yangcan was dead, so he ultimately decided to check the contents of the treasure storage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui attempted to put his Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and managed to do so without any problems. He thought about it for a while and finally understood why - it must have been the recognition of the spirit beast. If he remembered correctly, the sable’s recognition with the Flower of Life did have a similar effect as the Divine Marionette Pellet.</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was discerning as it would not acknowledge its master immediately. Because of Qing Shui’s Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, the Flower of Life, and Qing Shui’s display of strength, the sable had finally acknowledged Qing Shui as its master.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then called out his Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable once again. He took out five Beast Pellets and Endurance Pellets for the sable to eat and increase its power quickly. Then, he took out a portion of the Agility-Enhancing Fruits and Strength-Enhancing Fruits and fed them to the sable as well. Qing Shui could feel the joy of the sable as its strength grew substantially. He felt relieved that he had kept a surplus amount of pellets and fruits just for this kind of moment.</p>
 <p>After a moment of dawdling, one hour passed. Qing Shui brought his Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable along and went straight towards the Zuoshi Clan’s treasure storage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was careful about approaching the treasure storage as there would normally be some sort of mechanism that protected the entrance to the storage. Qing Shui circulated his strength to the maximum with his Blue Lotus Art. In most cases, the common mechanisms protecting a treasure storage would be hidden arrows or the release of poisonous gas.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked slowly towards the path before turning two corners to reach a humongous room. A door made of unknown metal had been opened and the gleaming gold of the treasure room leaked out of the gaping entrance. The gleaming of the treasures felt a bit chilly to his senses.</p>
 <p>What caught his attention were six people inside the room. They were all dead, as evident by their honeycomb-like appearance caused by the explosion of the dark arrows stuck on their bodies. The blood on their bodies was all black as well.</p>
 <p>Poison arrows!</p>
 <p>Just then, a strong force came out of nowhere and pushed against Qing Shui. He realized he wasn’t able to endure the sudden force, so he had no choice but to bring the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable with him into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>After a while, Qing Shui and the sable came out again. The situation had reverted to normal, but the entrance door was now closed tightly. Qing Shui tried to use the Thunder God to burst the door open, but failed despite the crumbling of the mountain rocks around the door. It didn’t seem the door would open even if he crushed the whole mountain.</p>
 <p>Screech screech!</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable let out two screeches and quickly climbed onto the front of the entrance door. It climbed around in one full circle, and baffled Qing Shui with its next move.</p>
 <p>The inner portion of the circle pattern that the sable had made suddenly collapsed. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable had corroded a part of the door in a circular motion…...</p>
 <p>“Such powerful poison,” Qing Shui thought. He was still in awe as he was filled with an indescribable feeling of happiness. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was a great boost to his strength and further secured his sense of security.</p>
 <p>Swish swish…..</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out his Violet Gold Divine Shield, and instinctively, the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable went up on his shoulders to take cover as well. Four golden lotuses also appeared around Qing Shui’s body to protect him from harm.</p>
 <p>Clink clink….</p>
 <p>After a series of clashes against his shield, he looked under his feet to discover several dark arrows. The first mechanism of the room had been triggered, but there was still another that he needed to find. The treasure storage was concealed from the outside world, so it was likely there wouldn’t be an excessive amount of traps in the storage itself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked into a large room with a cautious heart. He looked at the six dead people from the Liu Clan inside the room. With their deaths and those of the four outside, the Liu Clan was thoroughly finished.</p>
 <p>These had been men of talent in the small Pingyang Country. It was too bad that they had all been weaker than the Zuoshi Clan but regardless, both clans were already finished.</p>
 <p>Treasures of silver, gold, and precious materials filled the room. The tables and shelves in the room were made of gold, and the record counters were made of jade…..</p>
 <p>Beast cores, beast leather, medicinal herbs were in abundance as well. Qing Shui was pleased that the medicinal herbs inside the room seemed quite powerful, with even some being of the 5,000-Year level.</p>
 <p>“See, this is what makes a true supreme aristocratic clan.” Qing Shui revealed a smile as he took the herbs and put them in his inventory. Then he rummaged through the collection to see what kind of medicinal herbs the Zuoshi Clan had been keeping inside the treasure room.</p>
 <p>LingZhi of 5,000 years, 5,000-Year Angelica Dahurica, 5,000-Year Starmoon Flower…….</p>
 <p>“Hmm, 5,000-Year Starmoon Flower?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed the gleaming speckles that shone like moonglow on the medicinal herb. The herb was as thick as a child’s arm and was shaped like crescent moon - all characteristics of a Starmoon Flower. It seemed that he had found one of the ingredients needed for the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet.</p>
 <p>The other 5,000-Year herbs were still abundant. It was a shame that they weren’t the ones required for the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet. Qing Shui was still happy because he might have a use for them later when the time was right. He didn’t have anything to fear with the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, so he stored the 5,000-Year Starmoon Flower inside the realm to keep the medicinal effect of the flower intact.</p>
