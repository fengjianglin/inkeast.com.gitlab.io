With how huge his stature was, he must have his own unique traits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing brandished her sword towards the skinny man when Qing Shui began moving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fat man was calm as he watched the Golden Battle Halberd in Qing Shui’s hand. With a slight movement, a small tornado appeared around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the fat man struck a punch, Qing Shui could see a whirlwind formed at its tip. The whirlwind, along with the tornado around him, created a peculiar storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

A strange aura pried the Golden Battle Halberd aside and in a flash, the fatman appeared in front of Qing Shui, striking another fist forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shocked beyond words. The energy that was exuding from the whirlwind was intriguing and strange. Together with the fat man’s blinding speed, his punch landed its mark against Qing Shui’s shoulder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt the strong force of the impact, and his body flew backwards uncontrollably. The silhouette of the fat man was like a shadow, appearing with another attack just as swiftly. This time, the power packed within the punch was even stronger than his previous strike.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s mood became grim. Did the fatman really think he was an easy target? His power wasn’t up to the standard where Qing Shui would even grow concern about. After numerous attacks, he had already grasped their ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The technique was similar to the Duality Punch, but they weren’t completely identical. If it had been someone who didn’t know Taichi, then they wouldn’t be able to retaliate even if they were overpowered in strength alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui was proficient in Taichi and he had even cultivated Taichi to a peak level. Knowledge had no limits; the peak that Qing Shui referred to was a mere level in the Grand Perfection Stage and not its final form. Martial arts have no limits!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite how big the fat man was, he was exceptionally agile. Always hot on his heels in a leisurely manner, as though he had his sight invariably locked on Qing Shui. With a tremble of his Golden Battle Halberd, a primitive diagram of the universe appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

He stared blankly at Qing Shui, processing the similarities in their proficiency at combat, or perhaps even realizing that it was more profound than his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Qing Shui could see that Qin Qing was an equal match in combat with the skinny man, even though she was more inclined towards being at a disadvantage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui struck with his Art of Pursuing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor’s Qi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a fluster, the abrupt change allowed Qin Qing to dismember one of the skinny man’s arm. This wasn’t out of the ordinary; after all, the combination of Emperor’s Qi and Art of Pursuing would make their target’s speed fall by 40%, causing a lapse in judgement. To lose an arm was considered fortunate in this case.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When fatman saw his companion’s miserable state, he abandoned Qing Shui and instead rushed to save his partner. After this many years of teamwork, they were close like brothers; even evildoers can have friends, and they were able to work together even in dire situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Art of Pursuing!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, Qing Shui and Qin Qing fought back to back, with attacks coming from each end. With the severity of losing an arm, the skinny man’s fighting capacity had likewise been reduced by at least half. In addition, he was in a weakened state and hence, when Qing Shui appeared behind him, without having the chance to attack, the skinny man was already struck down by Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pierced through the heart!</span></p>

His eyes reddened and with a roar, he charged towards Qing Shui and Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purpose of their invitation to battle had been to establish Qin King Manor’s reputation. Furthermore, it was led by Qing Shui and Qin Qing. Even though Qing Shui wasn’t a member of the Qin King Manor, but he had all sorts of connection with them. To an outsider, he was practically part of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of a clan wasn’t determined by just its present state or its leader. You’ll also have to consider its emerging forces. Those without any new, emerging powers would fall with time and so, these new entrants could be even more important than you would think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing and Qing Shui were the new emergence in this case. Doing this was to show all the other powerful clans that Qin King Manor’s future generation was as outstanding as before. It was a warning to think twice before they offended Qin King Manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had to be exceptionally cruel and merciless this time, only then would they be a deterrence to any other powerhouses around. Even ghosts were afraid of the wicked and in the eyes of many, being cruel and merciless was exactly that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching the fat man charge towards them, Qing Shui rushed forward without hesitance and struck with Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique, Phoenix Finger and his Taichi techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The storm around the fat man grew more intense. With a powerful strike of his fist, a foot long whirlwind formed when he attacked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft crunch sounded. Qing Shui had long grasped the effect of the whirlwind. Just like a formation or a revolving circle, as long as you could relay a forceful method, you’ll be able to break it. Of course, it’s much easier said than done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;However, Qing Shui had already attained such incredible level of Taichi. At the very least, the fat man was no match for him. With his halberd, the fat man was flicked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What surprised Qing Shui though, was the fact that there seemed to be a whirlwind surrounding the fatman’s entire body. Upon collision, it would bounce in momentum. When the fatman was flicked away, it was because of this that he wasn’t severely injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was even better than a balloon. As long as this bubble wasn’t broken, it would be difficult for him to injure the opponent with his attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qing Shui didn’t give up. Instead, he waited patiently for his chance.</span></p>

It hadn’t worked before, yet all of a sudden, with that one additional strike, it broke through. He didn’t dwell on it long, for he was soon drowned in darkness.</span></p>

According to the rules, Qing Shui and Qin Qing would have half an hour to rest. Despite that, the two of them didn’t leave, they just stood there in indication that others could continue approaching them for a challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>

The young man was tall, with a pretty face but the smiling expression at the corner of his lips and eyes seemed to give the impression that he was unrestrained.&nbsp;</span></p>

The only thing that wasn’t, was that his brow ridge was too high, to the extent that it was almost terrifying. His eyes were calm when he regarded Qing Shui in the beginning but now, they were sharp like knives.&nbsp;</span></p>

For some reason, Qing Shui had the impression that they were hiding their malicious intent behind those smiles, and that was even more annoying than the previous pair of contenders—especially the younger man. Qing Shui wanted to give him a beating right about now.&nbsp;</span></p>
