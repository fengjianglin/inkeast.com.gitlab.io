 <p><strong>Chapter 390 Yan City Lai Clan, Lai Chusong.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 390 - Yan City Lai Clan, Lai Chusong</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The beast carriage stopped outside the Lai residence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui paid for the trip, he looked as the beast carriage sped off into the distance.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, why did we come to the Lai residence?” Qing Yi questioned as she looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp;Qing Shui hesitated for a moment. He remembered Lai Chusong mentioning that if Qing Shui ever came to Yan City, he could look for him. The Lai Clan is a considerably well-to-do family in the Yanjiang Country. Since he had such “convenience”, Qing Shui decided to use it. After all, as they were foreigners in the unfamiliar Yan City, it would be more convenient to know a native.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have a friend from the Lai Clan. I also have something to ask of him!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the wide gates of the Lai residence, there were two rows of armor-clad guards. Their abilities were barely at Martial Commander Grade. However, for door guards, that level was already sufficient.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Visitors, please stop!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An imposing middle-aged man with a sword stepped up and blocked Qing Shui. He spoke seriously, his voice was calm and forceful but without a shred of rudeness. Sincerity shone through his bright eyes framed by his square face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded his head in approval. The quality of the guards are already quite good!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“I am here to see Lai Chusong. Is he in?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are?” the middle aged man asked with a lifted brow.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am from Hundred Miles City!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man thought for a while and responded to Qing Shui, “Can I go to get further instructions?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man left quickly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, do you think we should just look for an inn instead?” Qing Luo asked as a complicated gaze passed his eyes. Qing Shui looked at him and laughed, shaking his head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that his grandfather was overthinking. His grandfather thought that since Qing Shui and the person from the Lai Clan were friends, normally their guard should be able to recognize Qing Shui. Unless the Lai Clan was unwilling to invite them in...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was actually uncertain. After all, some years have passed since. People change, and he might have been forgotten. He couldn’t deny that he charged the man “medical fees” when he treated him previously.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was also taking this opportunity to test if the man was worth befriending. Whether the frailty of human nature is able to within such a test.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within fifteen minutes, Qing Shui smiled. He could still see the faintly familiar figure of Lai Chusong pacing towards them quickly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before Lai Chusong reached them, his amiable voice called out, “Sir. It’s really you! It’s really you! Please come in everybody, come in!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui observed the well-dressed Lai Chusong. Not having seen him for years, his appearance was still the same. However, his mannerisms and aura have totally changed. He now even felt somewhat masculine.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lai, no formalities, please.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“And these people are?” Lai Chusong was now standing in front of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“My maternal grandfather, my mother…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui introduced his family. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How are you, old sir? How are you, madam?” Lai Chusong cordially greeted them one by one. Others may not know Qing Shui’s capabilities, but Lai Chusong definitely knew.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since he was young, Lai Chusong had kept a piece of advice close to his heart. One must never forget one’s roots and one must never underestimate another.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Being from a large clan, Lai Chusong had sharp foresight and keen sense. He knew that the much younger man standing in front of him was not without talent. That man with such an exceptional god-like healing skill could easily earn fame and fortune within any city.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp;Qing Shui noticed that Lai Chusong’s eyes brightened up when he saw the women, like Canghai Mingyue. His eyes revealed his admiration, but Chusong did not stare. He did not show any rapaciousness nor gave any disgusting looks. This added to the favorable impression that Qing Shui had.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; It was only when they stepped into the Lai residence did Qing Shui realize the Lai Clan’s affluence. It was no wonder the Lai Clan had some influence in Yan City. Having such a residence in the capital of Yan city was already a symbol of power.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On their way, they saw rock gardens, small lakes, greenery and pavilions...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was what a decent clan residence looks like. In Hundred Miles City, it was impossible to find any residence this opulent. It was an eye-opening experience for Qing Luo, Qing He, Qing Yi, Qing You and the others.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The layout of the Lai residence was not inferior to the interiors of the Skysword Sect. Qing Shui was certain that the Lai family’s influence must be greater than that of the Skyword Sect.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were Martial King Grade experts in the Lai Clan, but at his level, they were nothing to him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Making a turn at the rock garden, crossing an arched bridge, routing past a luxurious looking pavillion, they came to an isolated courtyard with many rooms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, how about here? We can let your grandfather, mother and your family stay here? What are your thoughts?” Lai Chusong asked cheerily looking at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thanks for your care, Brother Lai!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui informed his grandfather and said to Lai Chusong, “Brother Lai, my grandfather and the others are tired so they will be resting. Let’s take a walk.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Great! The meals, fruits, snacks and tea will arrive soon.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, accompanied by Lai Chusong, walked towards another building some distance away.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them entered a hall. It was extremely quiet. Qing Shui used his Spiritual Sense and checked that there was nobody within a hundred meter radius.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lai, how’s everything?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thanks to you sir, everything is fine!” Lai Chusong once called Qing Shui ‘sir’. Qing Shui could see his sincerity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, “sir” is an extremely polite title.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lai, why are you unwilling to befriend me?” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, will it be convenient for me to ask what your purpose is coming to Yan City?” &nbsp;Lai Chusong knew that Qing Shui had came to Yan City to settle something. However, at this point, it was difficult for him to guess why Qing Shui even brought his family.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, I will keep you guessing, but you will find out soon.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, then I will wait to see!” Lai Chusong laughed heartily.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lai, how is Lai Clan in comparison to Yan Clan? I don’t have any other intentions.” Qing Shui pondered as he asked. It is common knowledge that knowing one’s own strength and that of the enemy’s is a sure way to victory. There was no harm getting more information.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lai Chusong was startled. He stared at Qing Shui before slowly replying , “Lai Clan is inferior to Yan Clan!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just with those few words, Qing Shui understood that the levels of the Martial King Grade warriors in Yan Clan must be exceedingly high and they will also have a lot of people. Yanjiang Country is in the top twenty countries in the Greencloud Continent. It cannot be compared to a bottom of the barrel country like Cang Lang Country. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the Yan Clan was the dominant clan in Yanjiang Country. It may not be able to compete with Heavenly Palace, Sword Tower and other large sects, but it was definitely on par with the Immortal Sword Sect in region of the Southern City. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That would mean that there were Grade 7 Martial King experts in the Yan Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about how naive he was in the past. It was naive and ridiculous that he thought he could just casually step into the Yan residence.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, it is rumored that there are Grade 7 Martial King experts in Yan clan. However, there is a clan that is even stronger that Yan Clan!” Lai Chusong looked at Qing Shui, but could not read his thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Which clan?” Qing Shui was quite curious. Yan Clan was the master of Yan City so logically there should not be any stronger clans. However, there would definitely be some obscure clans with extremely high abilities but with no interest in being any city custodians.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Xiao Clan. They are relatives to Yan Clan by marriage. It is rumored that they have a Grade 8 Martial King expert overseeing the clan.” Lai Chusong watched Qing Shui as he replied.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, he was unable to see anything from Qing Shui’s clear eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If I want to attack the Yan Clan, will Brother Lai help me?”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, “sir” is an extremely polite title.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lai, why are you unwilling to befriend me?” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, will it be convenient for me to ask what your purpose is coming to Yan City?” &nbsp;Lai Chusong knew that Qing Shui had came to Yan City to settle something. However, at this point, it was difficult for him to guess why Qing Shui even brought his family.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, I will keep you guessing, but you will find out soon.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Well, then I will wait to see!” Lai Chusong laughed heartily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lai, how is Lai Clan in comparison to Yan Clan? I don’t have any other intentions.” Qing Shui pondered as he asked. It is common knowledge that knowing one’s own strength and that of the enemy’s is a sure way to victory. There was no harm getting more information.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lai Chusong was startled. He stared at Qing Shui before slowly replying , “Lai Clan is inferior to Yan Clan!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just with those few words, Qing Shui understood that the levels of the Martial King Grade warriors in Yan Clan must be exceedingly high and they will also have a lot of people. Yanjiang Country is in the top twenty countries in the Greencloud Continent. It cannot be compared to a bottom of the barrel country like Cang Lang Country. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the Yan Clan was the dominant clan in Yanjiang Country. It may not be able to compete with Heavenly Palace, Sword Tower and other large sects, but it was definitely on par with the Immortal Sword Sect in region of the Southern City. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That would mean that there were Grade 7 Martial King experts in the Yan Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about how naive he was in the past. It was naive and ridiculous that he thought he could just casually step into the Yan residence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, it is rumored that there are Grade 7 Martial King experts in Yan clan. However, there is a clan that is even stronger that Yan Clan!” Lai Chusong looked at Qing Shui, but could not read his thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Which clan?” Qing Shui was quite curious. Yan Clan was the master of Yan City so logically there should not be any stronger clans. However, there would definitely be some obscure clans with extremely high abilities but with no interest in being any city custodians.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Xiao Clan. They are relatives to Yan Clan by marriage. It is rumored that they have a Grade 8 Martial King expert overseeing the clan.” Lai Chusong watched Qing Shui as he replied.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, he was unable to see anything from Qing Shui’s clear eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If I want to attack the Yan Clan, will Brother Lai help me?”</p>
