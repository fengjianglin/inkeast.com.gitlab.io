 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the Niu Clan had already restored the Imperial Cuisine Hall, they quickly brought back the items that had been moved out earlier. This time around, the Niu Clan had been completely shamed. Therefore, if nothing went wrong, they would move away very quickly. This was also in consideration for the lives of their clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui came back, he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. No one bothered him. They knew that he was hurt and that he needed peace to recuperate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After arriving in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he took a look at the Hell Nightmare Beast's injuries. He realized that it had basically recovered completely. Thinking of that spike and pair of scissors, he went over and picked them up. They were the Golden Phoenix Scissors and the Diamond Staff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were all great treasures, and both the Golden Phoenix Scissors and the Diamond Staff were made from the same material. It was a pity that the Niu Clan's Old Ancestor didn't have the means to completely bring out the prowess of these treasures. They also required blood essence to recognize the owner, and might be controllable through consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui planned to leave the Diamond Staff for Qin Qing. He had the Golden Battle Halberd, thus the Golden Phoenix Scissors were sufficient. However, at the thought that what Qin Qing had was the Phoenix Battle God Inheritance, he started hesitating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and headed for Qin Qing's room. They didn't stay in the same building; the places they stayed in were right next to each other. Previously, Lan Lingfeng and Ziche Sha didn't stay in the same building either, but now they were...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Qing Shui stepped into the building, Qin Qing also sensed it. It was still early and she didn't really understand why Qing Shui had come looking for her so early in the morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he arrived at the door to Qin Qing's room, he saw that Qin Qing was already standing there. Qing Shui smiled, "I've something to talk to you about."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Come in!" Qin Qing smiled and went into her room. Qing Shui could sense that her heart was beating a little quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Qin Qing wasn't prepared yet, thus he brought out the Golden Phoenix Scissors and the Diamond Staff, saying, "These are the two sharp weapons that belonged to that old man. However, he hadn't been able to display their full prowess. Which one of them do you like? I'll tell you how to use the one you pick. With any of these two, your battle prowess would be doubled at least."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You can keep them. You need them more." Qin Qing gave it some thought and then said to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You don't like them?" Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"All cultivators like things that can raise their powers. However, I have the feeling that you need them more." Qin Qing shook her head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Little Qing Qing, do you not know what happiness is?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing threw a speechless glance at Qing Shui. She realized that she was already used to this form of address and no longer detested it as much. Thinking of this gave her an indescribable feeling. She had no idea if she should be happy or anxious. She hoped that there'd be one day where she could accept Qing Shui and his views on love and marriage. She hoped that she'd be able to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm very happy!" Qin Qing and Qing Shui sat opposite each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're happy, but why are you not letting me feel happy?" Qing Shui smiled, asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you not happy? I'm not trying to stop you from feeling happy. Right now, you look like you're very happy." Qin Qing wore faint smile. She enjoyed the feeling when she was with Qing Shui. It was very relaxing, comfortable, heartwarming. He gave off the feeling that he was trustworthy and would be able to give a sense of security. She also felt that it was like what he said, that she had already treated him as her family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My happiness is to share. Sharing with my family is my happiness. It's only through this that I can gain the greatest happiness. Now that I have two more items, I'm willing to share one of it with you. Do you want it?" Qing Shui looked at Qin Qing warmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Qin Qing no longer stood on ceremony. She picked up that exquisite and nice looking pair of scissors. "Then I'll take the scissors."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was thankful that he hadn't been in a rush to let the weapon recognize its owner previously. Qing Shui told her about the process and that treasures of this level required 100 drops of blood essence. He wanted Qin Qing to make the preparations and to bring her body's condition to the optimal level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood essence was very precious and one drop of blood essence was comparable to over 100 drops of ordinary blood. 100 drops of blood essence were very damaging to the Origin Qi and recovering the blood essence was a very slow process. A person would only be able to recover one drop of it every day. There were also some medicines and people with unique physiques which could bring about a faster recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a unique physique, plus he also had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Therefore, this wasn't a problem for him. Qin Qing also had a unique physique, but would probably need to take at least ten days before she could recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing mentioned that she wanted to do it immediately and after a quick scan with his senses, Qing Shui felt that there was nothing wrong with her body's condition either and helped to stand on guard. The Niu Clan's Old Ancestor didn't know the method of letting the equipment recognize its owner, and Qing Shui only managed to realize the method through his Heavenly Vision Technique. If the old man had gone ahead with the owner’s recognition, Qing Shui might have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drops after drops of blood essence landed on the Golden Phoenix Scissors which mysteriously engulfed them. This scene was very eerie, and the requirement just as strange. It must be 100 drops, not a single drop more or less. People who didn't know of the method wouldn't do it this way. For many items, ordinary blood would suffice, but for a treasure of this level, the blood essence was a necessity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For many people, they would die from releasing 100 drops of blood essence. If it was only 99 drops, or if it exceeded 100 drops, there wouldn't be any effect at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the 100 drops of blood essence, Qin Qing's countenance turned extremely pale. However, she watched on with great anticipation. After the time taken for one incense to burn, a glow that seemed like golden flames appeared on the Golden Phoenix Scissors. It was an extremely sharp feeling that seemed to be able to pierce the soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a feeling of blood connection rose and a stream of golden Qi flowed into Qin Qing's body, causing her initially weak body to regain at least 20% of her vital essence and blood essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing now felt a lot better. Moreover, she had a unique physique to help her. With a single thought, the Golden Phoenix Scissors flew up, changed in size and even shape. However, no matter how it changed, it still appeared like a pair of scissors with a golden phoenix condensed from the golden flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing controlled the three-meter Golden Phoenix Scissors, which exuded a terrifying sharpness. Qing Shui was very interested in this thing's sharpness. It could break through his defense and even cut open the Hell Nightmare Beast’s hide...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing had seen that previously as well, and thus loved it a lot. Qing Shui saw that everything was fine and stood up to leave. When he reached outside, he bumped into Yin Tong, Ling Fei, Lan Lingfeng, and Ziche Sha, who had just returned from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were also surprised to see Qing Shui. It turned out that none of them had been resting. Qing Shui smiled and said, "You guys haven't been resting either? This is timely. This thing should be more suited for you guys."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave them the incantation of the Juxtapose Phoenix, having it written down on paper. Amongst the two men, one was devoted while the other had a strong infatuation, thus the Juxtapose Phoenix should be able to be put to great use. Ziche Sha and Ling Fei weren't ordinary ladies either. Although they couldn't be compared to the talents the ladies on the portraits of beauty had, they were still slightly more powerful than ordinary geniuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking a look at the introduction for the Juxtapose Phoenix, all of them were very happy. They felt that they could really bring out the best of this battle technique, unlike how Qing Shui decided to not practice it at all. No matter how insignificant it was, it would still be able to contribute. However, Qing Shui still didn't wish to practice it. He didn't like the feeling where he couldn't reach the best. Moreover, once he were to be with the women he loved, he would feel uncomfortable at the thought of this ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also due to this reason that Qing Shui decided to not practice this. He didn't let his women practice it either. He wasn't sure if this was a right decision, but at the current moment, it was still something he insisted on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Qing Shui returned to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and took out the remaining Diamond Staff. He eventually decided to keep it for himself and go through the owner recognition process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui already had quite a number of treasures, but the level of this Diamond Staff was extremely high. It wouldn't lose out to the Nine Continents Mountain or the Arhat Rosary Beads at all. Although Qing Shui was injured, his Origin Qi wasn't dealt a great blow and was able to withstand the owner recognition process. Moreover, with the spiritual Qi and time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would have recovered by the time he went out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the process succeeded, Qing Shui discovered to his surprise that this item wasn't just extremely sharp. What astonished him even more, bringing him great joy was that it would increase the power of his five elements forces. It was a Divine Artifact for harnessing the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doubling the control of the five elements, doubling the five elements abilities, increasing the five core forces of the five elements, namely incisiveness, solidity, gentleness, explosiveness, and life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now felt exhilarated. He now had attacking powers too. Although they weren't as good as his terrifying defense, if he were to regain his best condition, with the Diamond Staff, even if he were to face someone like the Niu Clan's old man forcibly head on, he wouldn't end up being in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui who was weak previously, now felt an endless amount of strength in him. However, he still made himself lay down to take a break. His body's depletion was tremendous and would need time to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the days that followed, Qing Shui would practice the Taichi Fist daily, familiarizing himself and cultivating the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique. His mental state kept on changing, and even the way he saw things kept improving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When an indescribable feeling entered his body from the Baihui Acupoint at the top of his head, in that instant, he felt increasingly cordial with the surroundings, as if everything was within his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had attained a breakthrough in his Heavenly Dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They said misery loves company, but there were also many cases where good things came in pairs. Qing Shui hadn't fully digested the joy from obtaining the Diamond Staff when he underwent a breakthrough in his Heavenly Dao. That happiness was something he couldn't describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one felt happy, time would seem to pass very fast. Qing Shui's body had recovered completely. And due to the Diamond Staff, his body was now filled with a surge of confidence and a violent gush of five elements force. He really felt like looking for someone to spar with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Qing Shui felt that there shouldn't be anyone who could be his match amongst those below the Heavenly Dao. He had this feeling earlier on, but he hadn't expected that there would be an existence like the Niu Clan's Old Ancestor, who had a terrifying Heavenly Dao, a Sure Kill Heavenly Technique, the Golden Phoenix Scissors and Divinities, as well as a tamed beast. Thankfully, Qing Shui had the Dragon Slaying Beast and the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. Moreover, he was also very strong and had the Nine Continents Mountain and other powerful battle techniques. With these, he managed to clinch a close victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui woke up the next day, it was already bright outside. Although his place was very cold, the sun would rise very early. The morning sun was still rising, but it was a pity that there wasn't much warmth. The sunlight that shone down provided more light than warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing appeared at almost the same time as Qing Shui. When they saw each other, they felt that this was a coincidence. Qin Qing still appeared a little weak, but she was in good spirits. Upon seeing Qing Shui, she smiled happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the morning sun, her faint smile was even more warm that the winter's sunlight. It was so beautiful that it could bring about the downfall of a country and its people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Qing Shui's gaze, a hint of flush appeared on her pale face. She felt very happy as well. Everyone enjoyed being liked back by the person they liked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if the gaze cast on them by the person they liked was a greedy one, they would still feel a little happy. If it was someone they detested using the same gaze, then she would find it detestable and disgusting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This applied even more so for women.</span></p>
