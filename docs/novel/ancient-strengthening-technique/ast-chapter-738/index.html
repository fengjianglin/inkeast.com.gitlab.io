 <p><strong>AST 738 - Ancient Thunderbolt Spear, The Clever Uses of Crystal Cards</strong></p>
 <p>“I’m considered half a Poison Master as well as half an Alchemist. The Mind Replenishing Pill that the person took out before has no effect against this poison.” Qing Shui said slowly as he took out the Thunder God and the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>“You actually managed to recognize my Mind Replenishing Pill. It seems like you’re really an Alchemist.” The elegant old man next to the old man in yellow gown looked at Qing Shui and slowly enunciated every word with a powerful voice.</p>
 <p>There were ten more people!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t say anything. He was thinking about how he should fight the battle. His strength had already been totally raised and he had also used the Heavenly Talismans on himself.</p>
 <p>He casually took out a whole lot of Heavenly Talismans and tossed them to them.</p>
 <p>“Talisman master?”Zuoshi Ziyan muttered to himself in doubt.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard it. But he didn't say anything. The Descending Heavens Talisman immediately reduced the old man’s strength by almost eight hundred countries. This made him unsure whether he should feel happy or upset.</p>
 <p>He was happy for being able to reduce it by so much but at the same time also upset that it was only possible when his opponent possessed strength that reached a certain frightening extent. He shook his head and summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, thinking it would be better if he initiated the first move.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was relieved that the Vajra Subdues Demons was a success. It seemed that even though the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could only weaken the opponent’s strength by 10%, it was unavoidable even for an elderly man with strength of four stars.</p>
 <p>In a short while, the old man’s strength was reduced by almost three thousand nine hundred countries. Even Zhuoshi Ziyan was shocked by it despite having formidable strength. He finally understood why his own clan members were killed. He waved his hand and a long spear appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>The barrel of the spear looked like it was made of ancient woods tangling together whereas the tip of the sword resembled electricity and thunder. It was the Thunderbolt! The Ancient Thunderbolt Spear refined with ancient magma fire.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart thumped. This time, he was really in trouble. The original strength of the elderly man was already quite frightening to begin with. Now, he has gotten himself an Ancient Thunderbolt Spear. Legend has it that Thunderbolt’s attacks were often attached with thunder and electricity energy. He didn’t know if Thunder God was able to block it.</p>
 <p>The other thing he was concerned about was whether the Thunderbolt would help to significantly raise the elderly man’s strength. But as he thought deeper into it, he let out a bitter smile on his face. The original function of the weapons were to help increase the strength of offensive attacks. Not to mention it was the Ancient Thunderbolt Spear he was looking at.</p>
 <p>The old man charged towards Qing Shui like a roc that opened up its wings. The four meter long enormous ancient spear struck towards Qing Shui with a violet blue colored light. The spear caused a series of explosions as it passed through the air, it was truly shocking!”</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>7 Stars Armor!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s raw defense was worth around three thousand and eight hundred countries. Under the effect of Diamond Protection, it would be worth around seven thousand and six hundred countries. Along with the 50% boost provided by Nature’s Energy and 40% provided from both Immovable Mountains and Heavenly Talisman, Qing Shui’s achieved thirteen thousand and seven hundred countries of defensive strength. Additionally, the Thunder God also helped him boost it by one fold and under the state of Seven Stars Armour, it once again multiplied by a fold. However, the effect would only last for half an hour.</p>
 <p>His defensive strength could temporarily be boosted up to slightly more than five stars.</p>
 <p>Even Qing Shui himself was stunned by it. It was as if he only realized how powerful it was to dual-wield. All along, he had felt it unnecessary to wield both a sword and a hammer at the same time. Not only did it look weird, the two weapons weren’t really a match for each other either. This was also Qing Shui’s last resort because he ran out of ideas. He never thought that it would be so powerful.</p>
 <p>Even the people opposite of Qing Shui were shocked when they saw him holding a long sword in his left hand and a hammer in his right hand. Furthermore, he also looked really strange, as though he was a blacksmith……</p>
 <p>They might even believe Qing Shui if he was to tell them that he was also partly a blacksmith.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui has significantly weakened the elderly men. They still managed to blow Qing Shui away with their attacks. Furthermore, the technique which Qing Shui used was Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt. Unfortunately, none of them was paralyzed by it.</p>
 <p>The old man watched Qing Shui as he got blown away by the attack. Even though the corner of Qing Shui’s mouth started trickle out blood, he wasn’t really heavily injured by it. A gleam of light flashed across Qing Shui’s eyes as he once again charged himself towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He was so fast that Qing Shui could only block him with his Thunder God. At the same time, he also used the Big Dipper Sword to protect the vital parts of his body.</p>
 <p>The difference in strength between Qing Shui and the elderly man was too large. The Thunderbolt had already made up for the amount of strength that got reduced previously. In fact, it felt like there was an increase to it. His attack wasn’t sufficient to go against his opponent and even though he possessed formidable defense, he would still die if he got hit in the fragile parts of his body.</p>
 <p>His opponent’s speed was too fast. Qing Shui was already sweating all over his back just after a few clashes. If it wasn’t for the accurate judgement of his spiritual sense, he would most likely have been dead by now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who found an opening, quickly swallowed down the Agility-Enhancing Fruit and Gale Pellet and received a one fold boost to his speed. Only after this did he feel a bit better. Despite this, he could only barely resist against it.</p>
 <p>Having agility was equal to having strength. With absolute speed, the opponent wouldn’t be able to do anything no matter how strong they were. Not to mention his opponent didn’t only have great speed, he was also at an absolute advantage.</p>
 <p>At this rate, Qing Shui would definitely lose the match. He had no time to use other techniques and was short of offensive techniques to use against the old man. If the other nine people decided to make their moves as well, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
 <p>Bang-Bang…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got hit in the chest by accident. Despite having formidable defensive strength, he still spat out blood from the attack. But because Qing Shui’s powerful body was recovering on its own, Qing Shui didn’t feel that it was such a big deal.</p>
 <p>Agility!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never thought that there would be a day when he craved so much for speed. The Cloud Mist Steps had been used by Qing Shui to its limit. However, the gap between their strengths was still too big. Furthermore, Qing Shui felt that his opponent cultivated some kind of techniques which could help raise one’s speed. Or else, he wouldn’t have just been able to barely stand up against him after using the Nine Continent’s Boots, Gale Pellet, Agility-Enhancing Fruit and so on.</p>
 <p>“That’s it!”</p>
 <p>A sudden joy emerged in Qing Shui’s heart. He suddenly thought about the Four-Eared Shadow Mouse Card that he had never used before.</p>
 <p>After dodging the attacks one more time, Qing Shui took out the crystal card and immediately patted it to his body. At that moment, Qing Shui felt a faintly discernible feeling flowing through his entire body. That feeling made him want to laugh out loudly.</p>
 <p>Effect: One fold boost in speed. Effect lasts for fifteen minutes. It could be stacked with similar battle techniques. Within fifteen minutes time, there was a fixed chance of dealing extra damage to the target.</p>
 <p>Originally, their speed differed by quite a large amount. But it would definitely be less than one fold. But now, after experiencing a one fold boost in speed, Qing Shui surpassed the elderly man in terms of speed.</p>
 <p>After dodging the attacks of the elderly man with ease, Qing Shui swung his sleeves and shot out two poisonous Coldsteel Needles from it. At the same time, he also used the Thunder God First Style, Heaven Shaking Attack.</p>
 <p>Even Zuoshi Ziyan was particularly concerned with Qing Shui’s poisonous needles and avoided it hurriedly. Qing Shui took the opportunity and used the Thunder God to attack with all his might.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The violet light on the Thunder God immediately clashed against the old man’s spear. It actually pushed the old man backwards. Qing Shui was stunned. He thought about the effect of the Four-Eared Shadow Mouse crystal card about there being a certain chance of causing extra damage. In other words, there’s a certain chance the offensive strength of his attack would multiply in that instant. It’s just that it was unclear how significant the boost would be.</p>
 <p>The more Zuoshi Ziyan fought, the more anxious he felt. It wasn’t weird for the very young man to kill the people from his clan with his current strength. He subconsciously moved his sight to Zuoshi Yun. Previously, he even had a feeling that Qing Shui intentionally left Zuoshi Yun behind…...</p>
 <p>Similarly, Qing Shui also smiled and looked at the pale Zhuoshi Yun. All along, Qing Shui was never fond of hedonistic sons of aristocratic clans. They relied on the reputation of their clans to tyrannically abuse people as much as they liked.</p>
 <p>It might have been because Zuoshi Ziyan didn’t manage to take down Qing Shui so soon, the old man, who took out a medicinal pill previously, indicated to the old man next to him with his eyes and the two assaulted Qing Shui almost at the same time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had also been keeping an eye on other people’s movements. As he saw the two old men making their moves, Qing Shui didn’t dare to slow down. He quickly took out another Crystal Demonic Beast Card, the Crystal Demonic Beast Card of the Skywolf.</p>
 <p>Sneak attack, making his attacks impossible to defend. It could temporarily increase the guard-break ability and speed of the user.</p>
 <p>Upon getting yet another boost in speed and offensive strength, Qing Shui felt more reassured. However, because the duration of the effect was also quite limited, he would need to finish off the battle as soon as possible. If he couldn’t manage to do it, the outcome would be unimaginable.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, he no longer had the crystal card of the White Jade Jiao. If not, the effect would have been even better,</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zuoshi Ziyan formed a flanking maneuver and slowly approached Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Blue Lotus Art!</p>
 <p>Three glowing lotus flowers appeared around Qing Shui. This was also the result of his cultivation. He was able to skillfully control the four lotus flowers. By doing so, not only was he able to increase his raw defense by 40%, he could also use it as a shield to protect himself and also initiate attacks. But at the moment, it was really bad at offensive attacks.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the situation would only worsen the longer the battle dragged on. He looked at the three old men who were getting closer and closer to him and thought that he would need to kill two of them. His targets were the two old men who joined in a bit later.</p>
 <p>The golden lotus flowers continuously rotated around Qing Shui and very quickly, they had already completely shielded him.</p>
 <p>“Be careful of his poisonous weapons!”</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Ziyan suddenly screamed out loudly. However, Qing Shui suddenly shot out two Frosted Iron Balls which had been dipped in poisons before. But at the time when he initiated the attack, he was completely enveloped by the golden lotus flowers.</p>
 <p>Twin Dragon Explosion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shot his Frosted Iron Balls at Zhuoshi Ziyan. He completely trapped Zhuoshi Ziyan with another two poisonous Hidden Weapons and violently charged towards the two elderly men.</p>
 <p>Thunder Strike!</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, Qing Shui has been struggling through the fight for quite some time already. He was again able to use the Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt. This was also one of the important reasons why Qing Shui was confident he could kill the two of them.</p>
 <p>Not everyone could block against the paralyzing effect of Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used Divinity Protection to block the other old man’s attack. The Big Dipper Sword on the other hand, it had already pierced through the body of the paralyzed old man. At the moment when the last remaining old man planned to retreat, he felt a trace of coldness at his neck.</p>
 <p>Shadowless Kill!</p>
 <p>It was the killer technique of short ranged needle type Hidden Weapons.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the condition to use it was also quite harsh. Prior to using it, the user had to stay still for a long time. However, it would definitely be a very powerful technique if it was to be combined with Divinity Protection. Last time, the technique which Qing Shui used along with the Coldsteel Needle to kill the two Zuoshi Clan members was exactly the Shadowless Kill. Shooting two at once was Qing Shui’s current limit.</p>
 <p>“Using the Divinity Protection, that could only be used once a day, to exchange for the life of two Peak Martial Saints should be worth it!” Qing Shui smiled as he was really satisfied with his own achievements.</p>
 <p>The strength of the two elderly men were second after Zhuoshi Ziyan. Unfortunately, after getting weakened by Qing Shui, they only had about two stars of strength left. It was fairly easy for Qing Shui to murder two warriors with strength that was worth two stars, not to mention that there were a lot of supplementary techniques currently in Qing Shui’s body.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Ziyan who avoided the Hidden Weapons got so angry that he almost spat out blood upon seeing the mess. His cold and sharp eyes suddenly turned bloody red. More than half of the strongest warriors from Zhuoshi Clan has been killed by this very young man.</p>
