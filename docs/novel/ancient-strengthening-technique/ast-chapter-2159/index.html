Qing Shui asked while smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why do you want to leave?" Nuo Lan asked him back with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You know why." Qing Shui sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If you were to leave, won't the people from the Demon Gate be pleased?" Nuo Lan smiled, saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"But very often, this is how things are. Even if others were to laugh, there would be times for people to leave. I'm not afraid of anything, but I don't wish for Lingyan to suffer because of this." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, Sister Lingyan won't suffer alright? This isn't much; moreover, the others aren't stupid either and will understand very soon. This bunch of thick headed people will come to seek your forgiveness then." Nuo Lan said, feeling a little helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Forget it. To think that the Demon Gate is using this kind of move." Qing Shui felt a little helpless as well. These people had really made use of vicious means to induce harm onto others intentionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan didn't say anything, but she wasn't in high spirits either. After Nuo Lan said a little bit more, she returned to the Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, is my presence here making it hard for you?" Tantai Lingyan asked in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How can that be? How should I say this... Those guys have a big built and are straightforward people, they also are kind by nature. It's just that they are hostile toward the Demon Gate. Earlier on, the Palace Lord had called me over to tell me not to take things to heart and even if I were to hear anything, I shouldn't take it seriously. I'm only afraid that you'll feel upset, and I might end up losing control and bring you with me, leaving this place. But if that were to happen, I might as well bring you with me and leave now." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, don't think about it anymore. This isn't anything major and your man isn't an unknown character now. Although I can't make use of my authority to hoodwink the masses single-handedly, I'm still quite well-known." Qing Shui grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're never serious!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is for you. Take a look and see if you like it." Qing Shui handed the brand new Goddess' Sword to Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan looked at the longsword which didn't seem much different from before. However, it now emitted a cooling aura which made her feel very comfortable. Holding it in her hands made her feel as if her heart was connected to it; as if in this instant, this sword was her own arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cooling aura darted into her body, making her feel a refreshing feeling all over. Then, at the moment it connected with the Glacier Divine Sword aura in her body, her entire body underwent a mysterious change. It was a sudden comprehension toward the Heavenly Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She suddenly felt that a lot of her confusions were cleared, and all the bones and meridian channels in her body went through a change, appearing smooth and fair as if her flesh were made of ice and her bones of jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, I want to go and do some sword practice!" Tantai Lingyan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't say another word and brought her to the mountain peak where they had been intimate not long ago. After arriving there, Tantai Lingyan blushed a little, but she still went up into the sky with a flash, holding onto the Goddess' Sword and then performing the Glacier Divine Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Icy Rain!</span></p>

The sword she was holding really seemed as though it held endless mysterious powers, and each time she swung her sword, it would carry a mysterious power and an endless charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To think that her Heavenly Dao realm had caught up to Qing Shui and seemed to almost showing signs of reaching a higher level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui had really stepped into the gates of the Heavenly Dao, and the same could be said for Tantai Lingyan after her current breakthrough. Moreover, she seemed to have made slightly more progress as compared to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. Her body's potential had been stimulated once again. Her physique had combined perfectly with the Glacier Divine Sword, and it was a result of this Goddess' Sword which had the Coldfrost merged into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan continued to perform the sword technique in the sky. Glacier Mountain, Iceberg Flood, Forest of Icy Swords, Screen of Icy Arrows...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An hour later, Tantai Lingyan came to a stop and continued to float in the sky. Right now, she seemed to be standing amidst the ice rivers and mountains, having an extremely cold and beautiful appearance. This was what a goddess of an ice mountain should really look like.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A short while later, everything disappeared. Tantai Lingyan descended slowly before Qing Shui. Right now, 30% of her icy aura had disappeared. She looked at Qing Shui, not saying thanks. Instead, to Qing Shui's surprise, she went up and wrapped her arms around his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui embraced her tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't do anything and quietly hugged her. Men and women are different. Men preferred visual impacts and would also tend to act impulsively with their lower bodies...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, women tend to prefer a connection of the hearts, like having hugs, stroking their backs, and things like that. Of course, those promiscuous women were the exceptions...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>

Every time, Qing Shui would accompany Tantai Lingyan in her sword practice and without realizing it, three days passed by. Right now, Qing Shui was looking at the Hundred Treasure Chest in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal agitatedly. It was because the second level of the Hundred Treasure Chest was going to be opened soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment the time was up, Qing Shui opened it up directly and smiled. This time around, there were more and better things than the previous time. Furthermore, not only were there some Divine Square Cauldrons which Qing Shui wanted, but he also saw some Divine Weapon Crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything made Qing Shui a little overwhelmed. This Hundred Treasure Chest seemed as if it was providing services for Divine Weapons; just like how his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and those alchemy recipes he had in the past were like. Many things were tied together by a vague connection.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were 60 Aptitude Pills, 60 Potential Pills, 60 Growth Pill, 50 Divine Square Cauldrons, 50 Divine Weapon Crystals, 14 Cultivation Pills, one Grade Three Offensive, Defensive, Movement, Recovery, Endurance, Power, Tenacity, and Evasion Talisman Stone respectively.</span></p>

He felt very happy to see so many of them, and he wondered how many Divine Weapon Crystals there would be in the future. There was even a set of Grade Three Talisman Stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a look at the Grade Three Talisman Stones. They increased 5% of an attribute permanently. A Grade One Talisman Stone increased an attribute by 3%, and a Grade Three Talisman Stone increased an attribute by 5%. This would mean that a Grade Two Talisman Stone would increase an attribute by 4%. This was on the basis that both Grade Two and Grade Three Talisman Stones had an increment of 1% of an attribute with each additional grade starting from a Grade One Talisman Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, overall, he was still quite satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had 60 of Aptitude Pills and Potential Pills respectively, double the amount he had gotten from the first level. Right now, Qing Shui already had 90 of these pills which he hadn't used after all this while. Their effect was considered quite good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each Aptitude Pill could increase one's aptitude by 1% and could be taken by both demonic beasts and humans. There were no restrictions on the amount, but the human body would gradually repel them until the time that it wouldn't absorb them any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Potential Pills, on the other hand, increased the human body's potential. It increased one's strength by 1%, but there was a limit to the number one could take either, which was until it reached a point where the body couldn't take in any more. In principle, taking one Potential Pill could increase one's strength by 1%, and if one's strength was at ten billion Dao Force, then taking one of these pills would increase one's strength by 100 million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Growth Pill increased one's talent, which meant that it could make an ordinary person become a genius. Each pill would increase the growth of one's talent by 1%. Qing Shui wondered how many Growth Pills would be required to make an ordinary person into a genius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't been using this either and kept it aside. He finally then looked toward the Cultivation Pills. There were only 14 of them, and Qing Shui looked at them curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivation Pill: Each pill increased one's cultivation by two years.</span></p>

Two years of one's cultivation was very vague. Was it two years' worth of hard work in cultivation or just ordinary cultivation?</span></p>
