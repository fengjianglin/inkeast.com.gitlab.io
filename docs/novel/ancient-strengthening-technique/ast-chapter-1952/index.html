 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 1952 - Returning Home, Two Additional Children</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's demonic beast wasn't as powerful as Yehuang Guwu's White Tiger. Their difference in strength was far too great. Moreover, there were eight of them. However, Qing Shui had the Nine Continents Mountain and the powerful Paragon Strike. The only downside was that the Paragon Strike could only be used once a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Continents Mountain was different and was now at Grade Seven. It had an attacking prowess that was five times that of his strength and it also came with a powerful Shield Attack that had an absolute defense. Even if it wasn't as powerful as the opponent, the Nine Continents Mountain won't be pushed back. However, a situation like this would deplete the owner's spirit energy a few times faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This meant that Qing Shui could easily use the Nine Continents Mountain to deal a damage of one billion Dao Force. Even Yehuang Guwu's White Tigers wouldn't be able to take the damage unfazed. After all, they were demonic beasts condensed from energy. If they were to receive a source of damage that was two times or more stronger, they would dissipate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yehuang Guwu's strength wasn't to be neglected. Other than Qing Shui himself, the others with him won't be able to handle a fight against her. This showed how powerful Yehuang Guwu was currently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu hugged Qing Shui happily, "I didn’t think that I would be able to attain a breakthrough to the seventh level of Divinity at the middle phase!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This isn't the most important thing. The most important is your Divine Path of the White Tiger. It's the most extraordinary one. You really are a reincarnation of the White Tiger[1]!" Qing Shui happily said. He could not help but think of the place on her body which was bare and like white jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's thoughts and gaze led him to look toward Yehuang Guwu's lower body. This made a mature lady like her pout in embarrassment. "You're getting worse."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of what had happened earlier, even Yehuang Guwu blushed. On their first time, he had entered the backyard by accident. Thereafter, such things had happened quite often. As long as it was brought up by Qing Shui, she would try out the different things according to his wishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw Yehuang Guwu's embarrassed expression, he felt especially happy. In the past, this woman had conducted herself with the air of a queen before him, being the one who did the teasing. He was the only one who had the special rights to see this side of her. She was his treasure. However, to outsiders, she appeared to be an unreachable existence and thus there was no way that she would be teased others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be because he had gotten stronger that Qing Shui also sensed some changes to himself as well. In the past, he would always feel that he wasn't mature enough whenever he was in front of her. Now, though he might be mature enough, he was still surprised that Yehuang Guwu would show this feminine and weak side of her to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You demoness. To think that I've been gobbled up by you when I just came back. It'll be hard for me to explain myself when I head back later." Qing Shui playfully said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they returned to the Qing Clan, everyone was happy to see him back. Because it had been quite a while since his last visit, there had been a lot of changes at home. Some of the younger ones had grown up, and those who were slightly older had now become adults.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mother!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi, who had walked out, and went over to her happily to give her a hug. Qing Yi didn't change much and was just like how she had been when Qing Shui was young. She was still as graceful as a swan. Time hadn't left any traces on her face but she still exuded a mature disposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You rascal. You still remember to come back?" Qing Yi rubbed Qing Shui's head and then held his face with her hands to check him out while wearing a happy smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've always wanted to come back. Now that I've found some time, I’m finally here again!" Qing Shui smiled and greeted the rest while giving hugs to men, women, and children alike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were now many people in the Qing Clan and this method of greeting took quite some time. Furthermore, there were also some who refused to let go after hugging Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Liu-Li, shouldn't you be letting go now?" Canghai Mingyue urged Huoyun Liu-Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huoyun Liu-Li blushed and let go of Qing Shui. After all, Qing Yi was still around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Di Chen and Di Qing weren't around, but there was something which took Qing Shui by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dongqing held the hand of a little kid and walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui opened his mouth. He immediately figured out that this was her son and it was the son she had with him. When he left the other time, he hadn’t confirmed if she was pregnant or not yet. It seemed that the pregnancy must have been discovered after he had left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dongqing hugged Qing Shui happily and then said to him, smiling, "Look, this little guy looks so much like you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's your name?" Qing Shui carried the little boy. The little boy didn't resist at all, only saying one thing while looking at Qing Shui, finding him unfamiliar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hello, Uncle!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart almost stopped beating as the others laughed heartily. Qing Shui looked at the boy and said while staring deep into his eyes, "I'm your father..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Saying this made Qing Shui felt a little strange, as if he was scolding someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Di Chen and Di Qing came back, Qing Shui was surprised once again. It was too amazing. The others also smiled in amusement. Di Chen was holding a little kid who was of the same age as Hai Dongqing's. However, this was a girl this time. She looked very beautiful and exquisite, like a porcelain doll.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This really is two strikes in a row..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't control himself at all. He also wanted the ladies to have his children and they liked having his children as well. Although they weren't old, it was about the age for them to become mothers. However, due to the restrictions of their age and cultivation level, it wasn't that easy for them to get pregnant. Although Qing Shui knew that it would be easier if he were to use some special methods, he didn't wish to do that. It wasn't easy to get pregnant, but it wasn't hard either. After all, they had time so there was no need for them to rush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen was still in white clothes, appearing just like a fairy. It was the same for Di Qing. This pair of sisters were both women in the Portraits of Beauty. Each time Qing Shui looked at them, he would feel that it was very unrealistic. If this scene was in his previous life, it would be immoral. Unless, it was in the ancient times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hugged both Di Chen and Di Qing, as well as Di Qing's daughter, Qing Nuo. Qing Nuo was over ten years old by now. She wrapped her hands around Qing Shui's neck happily and said, "Father, Nuo`er misses you very much."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That crisp voice made Qing Shui felt very happy. This was his daughter. The feeling of blood connection, of being extremely close, felt very good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father misses Nuo`er too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lass next to Di Chen was also a few years old. After all, Qing Shui had left for a few years. She was now looking at Qing Shui curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui realized that when there were too many children, it would be hard for him to be able to handle all of them. He carried the boy from earlier with one hand, and then Di Chen's daughter with the other. He knew that both of them had nicknames, but didn't have actual names. Their mothers were waiting for Qing Shui to give them names after he returned.</span></p>
