 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, Yin Tian and his wife had tried very hard to persuade the Qingfeng and Mingyue Clans which were bent on leaving. However, for them to come back in a time like this, all the barriers between them were gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It might be that only by coming back, even if it meant their deaths, would they have a peace of mind. Otherwise, if the Yin Clan and the Divine Moon Immortal Sect were eradicated and they themselves were to remain alive, they would live in guilt for their entire lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yin Tian and Feng Xi saw them back, they were both happy and upset. However, they didn't say anything. After so many years together, they could understand everything with just an exchange of a glance or through a single movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out the gold needles to help treat Old Wang and Yin Tian. He had even brought out some medicinal pills and some medicinal herbs for the preparation of the medicine for them. Qing Shui did these in progression as he thought of the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current situation was clearly very bad for the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. Both Yin Tian and Old Wang couldn't take part in the battle at this moment. Most importantly, they didn’t know anything about the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect. Not even how strong they were. They were clearly on the defensive side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite so, Qing Shui still had a great feeling that he would be able to handle the situation. Tantai Lingyan, the old turtle, together with Feng Xi, Yin Sha, as well as Qingfeng and Mingyue were all Divinities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, there was also himself, the Dark Phoenix, and Long Zhu`er. Therefore, it wasn't as if they didn’t have anyone who could put up a fight. This was the reason why Qing Shui was able to remain calm all this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui was done with all these, half a day had gone by. Yin Tian's and Old Wang's injuries had already been looked at, but they would still need some time for recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, Feng Xi heaved a sigh of relief. Although they didn't think well of the current situation, when they saw that Qing Shui was very calm, as if he had an astonishing power, causing them to feel at ease as well. It felt as if they could get over the obstacle right in front of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling was very strange and even they themselves couldn’t figure out why they would feel this way. The one thing they knew for certain was that Qing Shui was now stronger than them. Even Tantai Lingyan was also slightly more powerful than them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Feng Xi returned to the room to have a chat while Old Wang and Yin Tian went to take a break. There were only Qing Shui, Yin Sha, Qingfeng, and Mingyue. They had lost a few Divinities in the battle and Yin Clan's battle prowess had been reduced drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn't harbor as much hope as previously when they sent Qing Shui a request for help. Not many people would come in such a situation. Moreover, the Yin Clan had no rights to get them to come. All along, the Yin Clan had been the side who were indebted to Qing Shui. This time around, if it wasn't because something in them which made them feel that there was a possibility, they wouldn't have asked Qing Shui for help. Otherwise, they would have gotten Qing Shui into trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, mother was very troubled too. She believes that you're the only one who can help the Divine Moon Immortal Sect to tide through this trial. However, she was afraid that it'd bring you harm and thus has been praying that you wouldn't come. I'm not someone who would say pretentious stuff, but sometimes, humans are really contradictory creatures." Yin Sha smiled bitterly and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can understand. For you guys to call me during a time like this, it showed that we're really a family. I'm actually very happy." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When humans were at their weakest, they would think about their family. It was the same when they were in danger. It was just like if a kid was bullied, the kid would think about the parents back at home. While this was an analogy, it was also a fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, be honest with me. Do we have any chances of winning? Even if it's just a little?" Yin Sha asked very carefully. He was really scared to hear Qing Shui's reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, "Since Lingyan could come, it meant that we have a great chance of winning. Otherwise, I wouldn't have allowed her to come." Qing Shui gave Yin Sha a reason which he could trust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Sha revealed a happy smile from the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Divine Moon Immortal Sect is merely an empty vessel now. Right now, all that's left is its name." When Yin Sha said this, there was an unconcealable disappointment on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother, what's this little setback? You must believe in yourself and in your abilities. The Divine Moon Immortal Sect will become strong again." Qing Shui patted Yin Sha on the shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qingfeng and Mingyue had come back one day earlier than Qing Shui, thus weren't injured. They had already been through life and death situations. If they could die here, it would also be an end to things. To them, being able to die here was also one of the better outcomes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"However, I've learned to accept a lot of things now. We cultivators live each day, risking our lives. Therefore, death is a very natural thing. It's just that it is hard to accept that fact at the very beginning. However, when it's inevitable, one would instead feel that it's not scary. The worst thing that could happen would only be losing your life." Yin Sha smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea if Yin Sha had already learned to accept this or not. There was just one thing he was sure of. His appearance should have let Yin Sha know that there was a hint of hope. A tiny spark could cause a great fire. This little hope was the spark. It was hard to say if a great fire could be lit up, but at least, there was a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day passed by very peacefully as well. The other party didn't make any move. Since they didn't make any move, Qing Shui chose not to do anything either. Right now, both Old Wang and Yin Tian needed time to recover and things mustn't get any worse. That was why waiting was the best option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and the Divine Moon Immortal Sect could wait, but the other party seemed to have lost their patience in playing it out. On the fourth day, several huge demonic beasts circled above the Divine Moon Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yin Tian, it's time to come out. Stop being a tortoise."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud voice rang out. Before the voice had reached them, Qing Shui and the group were already standing in the large square of the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. Even Yin Tian and Old Wang were here. They insisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sensed the auras of the demonic beasts in the air as well as the opposite party’s cultivators. He realized that most of them only had the strength of 1,000 Dao force, with only a few of them being at around 1,500 to 1,800 Dao force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This situation gave Qing Shui a very pleasant surprise. Although these people weren't the strongest amongst the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect, he knew that they were no match for him. Even if there were stronger existences backing them up, there wouldn't be many of them. Qing Shui now had a grasp at their level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man who had spoken didn't seem to be of very old age. Or rather, he didn't appear that way. There was still black hair mixed with the white ones on his head, displaying a mysterious dominating appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man's eyes were incredibly sharp but he had thin and drooping brows. The brows gave the old man an indescribable feeling and appeared both amiable but also having prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tian was now practically about the same as an ordinary person. Therefore, when in such a situation, there wasn't any way for them to talk. They were already at the disadvantage in terms of the standing. Thus, it would be better for them to not say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Yin Tian didn't say anything, the old man on the other side spoke up once again, "Are you going to watch your wife and child die? Or perhaps, are you going to choose to commit suicide and wait to be reunited in the other world?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't say anything and looked toward the three old men next to the first one. There were still over ten old men behind them. The Demonic Saber Immortal Sect really put their best effort into this operation. Around 20 of them were Divinities and while they were of varying strengths, it was still quite astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Now that things have come down to this, what's the point of spouting so much gibberish? It's just the case of a vile character gaining the upper hand." Yin Sha said to the old man who wasn't that far away from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui, Yin Sha, as well as Qingfeng and Mingyue were at the top while Tantai Lingyan and Feng Xi were on the ground. This was something which Qing Shui had insisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha, I've forgotten about this. The old are already useless and right now, you're the one who calls the shots in the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. It's a pity that the Divine Moon Immortal Sect will have to die in your hands. I wonder how you're going to seek forgiveness from your ancestors after you've gone to the other world." The old man said, amused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the old man who was trying to rub salt into their wounds. People like him enjoyed seeing the expressions the opponents wear while feeling desperation. They like to see the helplessness and lost expressions when the opponent had no other ways out. Qing Shui wasn't sure if this was considered normal, but this man was definitely a vicious person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What are you being so proud about? We aren't sure who's going to be the one to die. Your arrogance has come too early!" Yin Sha snorted coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If I wanted to kill you guys, would you be able to stay alive until now? Oh, I forgot that you have new people with you now. Could it be that you're relying on just these few of them?" The old man looked at Qing Shui, Qingfeng, Mingyue, and Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll give you a chance. Get the strongest you have now out here. Otherwise, you might not get another chance to do so later." At this moment, Qing Shui smiled and said to the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man examined this young man. He didn't know how this young man could remain so calm. However, on the thought that he was an expert from the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect, he no longer had any more reservations.</span></p>
