 <p><strong>AST 1003 - Son: Qing Long, Decision</strong></p>
 <p>The thing on Qing Shui’s mind the most was Lion King’s Ridge. He did not know what their strongest strength level was. Demon Gate was another thing but the thing that worried Qing Shui the most was the other four continents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that strong sects like Lion King’s Ridge and Demon Gate would definitely have people entering the other four continents. Further, there should be other families and sects in the other four continents as well.</p>
 <p>Going to the other four continents could accelerate cultivation. They could also strengthen their abilities. Without thinking about going to the other four continents, he could not even be certain if he could handle someone that came over from the other four continents.</p>
 <p>The strength of the other four continents was a mystery to Qing Shui. If a ten thousand stars strength martial artist came over, he would not be able to deal with it. To find someone on the five continents with the strength of ten thousand stars was as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. But on the other four continents, everything was possible.</p>
 <p>In the end, Qing Shui did not want to think about it anymore. Working hard to raise his own strength was the way to go. Someone from the five continents or the other four continents, if they come he will strike them.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Gathering Lamp seems to be stuck at fifth stage. Qing Shui was not sure whether there was a sixth stage. Right now, only Fire Bird benefitted the most, since it could get to a destructive power of six thousand stars. However, bound by the rules of heaven and earth, one could only exert the strength of five thousand stars. However, if under the effects of Four Phases Formation, then Fire Bird’s strength can rise a bit more but was still only a little bit higher than five thousand stars.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly he had already returned to Qing Clan for almost a year. Zhu Qing was already eight months into her pregnancy.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Two months went by in a flash.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was pacing outside the door. Zhu Qing was inside the room about to give birth. Qing Qing had already given birth ten days ago; it was a boy. All of Guo Clan had come to visit.</p>
 <p>But right now, it was Zhu Qing. Qing Shui did not know the reason as to why he was so nervous but he was also happy. He felt a bit guilty about Zhu Qing, had he not made up his mind back then, Zhu Qing would still be alone in the Skysword Sect right now.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui was happy, especially since she was pregnant. A woman without any blood-related family was lonely. Even if she married into Qing Clan and Qing Shui plus everyone treated her nicely, she would still feel lonely and insecure. That was because Qing Shui had more than one woman and could not always stay by her side.</p>
 <p>A child could let her feel not as alone anymore. Now that she had someone related by blood, it also tied her deeply into Qing Shui’s family. It was blood ties, the feeling you get from family ties that were closer than social relationships.</p>
 <p>Even in his previous life, it was said that a marriage without children was not perfect. Children were the link between parents, family and racial prosperity. Husband and wife started out without being related. Feelings could fade, only by changing feelings into familial bonds would they become everlasting. Without children, feelings could also become family love but this bond was more brittle than those couples who had children.</p>
 <p>In the past life, there were survey results that indicated couples with children divorced far less than those without. Children could link parents together, slowly evolving feelings into familial affection.</p>
 <p>Waaaaaaa!</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui lost focus for a bit, a high-pitched cry came from the room. Qing Shui immediately ran into the inner house.</p>
 <p>After arriving in the room, Qing Yi and several of the women were here. At this moment, Qing Yi was embracing a child wrapped in an embroidered cloth. The crying was coming from there.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat beside the bed and held onto Zhu Qing’s hand. Seeing his woman with a smile of happiness, he felt satisfied. Qing Yi passed the baby to Qing Shui while smiling.</p>
 <p>“It’s a boy, quick think of a name!” Qing Yi smiled while looking at her son.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the baby that was as bright as jade. In his previous life, he had seen a newborn looking ugly and dull. Most of them would only become beautiful after some time but there were always exceptions.</p>
 <p>However, when Qing Shui watched Qing Zun’s and Qing Yi’s birth, both were like carved out of jade. This little guy was the same, he also had big eyes. Qing Shui embraced the little guy and shown him to Zhu Qing.</p>
 <p>“Hope my son becomes as successful as a dragon. Let’s call him Qing Long!” Qing Shui said and paused.</p>
 <p>Combining his last name with dragon sounded awesome. Everyone agreed with a bit of laughter. Qing Shui’s children could be called anything and it would still sound good.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing happily called her and Qing Shui’s child by name. The little guy had already fallen asleep. Others also took their leave after seeing that everything went by alright. The only people left were Qing Shui and Zhu Qing who were watching their baby sleep.</p>
 <p>He gave a Constitution Nurturing Pill to Zhu Qing and gave her some All Aspect Nourishment Soup to eat.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing looked at Qing Shui, though most of her attention was placed on the little guy. Her face was filled with a blessed expression. Seeing his own woman in happiness, Qing Shui’s heart was surprisingly peaceful.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I have never been happier in these past few years.” Zhu Qing reached out to touch her baby’s face. He was a part of her that tightly linked her to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Hereafter, everyday will be filled with happiness. I will let you be the happiest girl in the world. As long as you are happy, I will be happy,” Qing Shui said while holding onto Zhu Qing.</p>
 <p>The first time she met him, she had only considered Qing Shui to be a delicate boy but right now she felt like she was younger than him. This was a type of change. The reason for this change was that he had become stronger inside and out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left after Zhu Qing fell asleep. He went to visit Qing Qing. Guo Polu’s mother was still here. Guo Yanglong had stayed here for several days, unwilling to leave. However, Guo Clan had many things to take care of and Guo Clan only had Guo Polu as their only son. Guo Polu and Qing Qing’s child would be regarded as the treasure of the family.</p>
 <p>New years had just passed, this time Qing Clan did not return to Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui’s strongest beast was the Fire Bird since Spirit Gathering Lamp had additional effects to the lethality of Five Elements Magic. For other beasts like the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, it did not help its attacks.</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast could but in its current strength it did not meet the requirement to consume the Hallow Pellet. Thus, he had been providing it with Ice Snow Sacred Fruit. Perhaps he could somehow find a way to craft some Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearls for it. However, coming across these things was not easy.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan would breakthrough Martial Emperor soon. It would take at most one month but could take as little as three to five days.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Jiange!”</p>
 <p>At the hill behind Heavenly Palace, Qing Shui found Yiye Jiange lost in thought.</p>
 <p>“Why are you alone being melancholy and moody without calling me?” Qing Shui said with a smile while walking towards Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“It’s alright, you don’t have to try to cheer me up. I only came here to check things out,” Yiye Jiange laughed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed her hand without any signs of embarrassment. It was as soft and tender as jade, what a wonderful feeling. He dared not look at that otherworldly face, “Let’s go, your husband will accompany you.”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange grudgingly glared at Qing Shui but Qing Shui did not turn his head back.</p>
 <p>Not far from where they were, there was an area covered in pear trees. Now that it was spring, a field of snow white pear blossoms as far as the eye could see bloomed beautifully.</p>
 <p>“As soon as I can, I will bring you and Luan Luan to Lion King’s Ridge with me.” Since his advancement in strength, Qing Shui was certain he would be able to bring Huo-yun Liu-Li to Demon Gate. The only thing he would need to do was to give Huoyun Liu-Li some notice.</p>
 <p>He was not certain whether Huoyun Liu-Li knew about her past but her foster parents had hoped Qing Shui would take her to Demon Gate at least once if he was capable.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui seriously, “Are you certain?”</p>
 <p>“Possibly … …”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I don’t want you to risk yourself,” Yiye Jiange said while sighing.</p>
 <p>“Elder Lin is from Northern Sacred Lu Continent’s Lin Clan,” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>“The Talisman and Seals Ancient Houses’ Lin Clan?” Yiye Jiange asked looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Should be. My Heavenly Talismans were taught by elder Lin. Central Continent has several families that know about Talisman and Seals.”</p>
 <p>“I was in the area, however Northern Sacred Lu Continent’s Lin Clan was stronger in Talisman and Seals. Or to say it in a different way, their Talismans were especially strong. Just like grades in martial arts, Lin Clan’s Talisman and Seals were at least a grade higher than the rest.”</p>
 <p>“Lin Clan was also targeted by Lion King’s Ridge. Destitute and homeless. I am not certain how many people are left,” Qing Shui said helplessly while shaking his head.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was silent, she did not know what to say.</p>
 <p>“Jiange, do you know Lion King’s Ridge well?” Qing Shui asked after a bit of thought. Given that Yiye Jiange was not young. At the very least, she had already had her coming of age ceremony.</p>
 <p>“Not much but I know Lion King’s Ridge was the strongest sect within the Northern Sacred Lu Continent. Their sect has many Aristocrat Clans and superior martial artists. Rumor has it that many of those families had people become Immortals of the Land and then leave,” Yiye Jiange said while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Immortals of the Land?”</p>
 <p>“We should travel to the other four continents!” Yiye Jiange explained.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of the answer but it was shocking. Lion King’s Ridge had many ancestors in the other four continents. It was unsure how well they were doing over there or whether they still had contact with people on the five continents. It was also uncertain if any of them would return to the five continents if their members were injured.</p>
 <p>Regardless, these one or two years would require more hardships in cultivation. Even if people from that side were to come, Qing Shui would still want to beat them to a pulp. He hoped that Area Dominance could rise another grade. Through formations, it could rise a bit in strength, after all strength of over ten thousand stars could exert another one tenth power.</p>
 <p>This moment, Qing Shui’s confidence grew.</p>
 <p>“Next year, we will go visit Northern Sacred Lu Continent!” Qing Shui said with certainty.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange laughed and stopped asking whether he was certain. She could not see through this man anymore, nor could she stop him. The most important thing was, she had complete trust in Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was a Peak Martial Saint but there was still some time before her breakthrough to Marital Emperor. This visit to Sacred Land of Panacea had been beneficial in many ways, her abilities had risen. Given her efforts in cultivation, pellets and weapons, her strength had gotten to a level equivalent to what Mu Qing had originally been.</p>
 <p>“Jiange, let me give you Gold Needle Acupuncture once, it will raise your strength.”</p>
 <p>Except, he was a bit hesitant at the end of the sentence.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui’s expression and could tell he had his reasons. She continued to gaze at Qing Shui as if to let him continue speaking.</p>
 <p>“Although I have not mentioned this before, since you were my master but Gold Needle Acupuncture is best done naked. I’ll keep my eyes close when I do it,” Qing Shui said with a bit of embarrassment and unease.</p>
