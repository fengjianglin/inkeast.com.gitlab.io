 <p><strong>AST 650 - The Gale Pellet, The Demonic Beast Advancing Pellet</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was in disbelief that the Alchemist Sect of the Seven Stars would come to provide assistance at this crucial moment. This was a completely unexpected comfort for him. But, he was still unsure about the number of people from the Alchemist Sect, who were coming to aid him. The extent of their abilities and strengths was unknown to his as well.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su noticed Qing Shui’s expression, so she quickly said: “Even though the cultivation in the Alchemist Sect is not as outstanding as you might think, the best thing we can provide are the medicinal pills. This time, we came to help not only with some medicinal pills, but also a few uncles from our clan.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I don’t have many friends like you, Miss Yuan. Even at a time like this, you are willing to give me a hand. You are the greatest friend anyone could ever ask for.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had actually thought that the Alchemist Sect was planning to overthrow the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect a long time ago. The ideas of refining medicines and refining poisons were in contrast with each other, as they were two very different concepts. Back then, when Qing Shui saw Yuan Su taking out a Pure Jade Pellet prescription, he already had a feeling that the Alchemist Sect and the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect were in mutual conflict.</p>
 <p>Of course, Qing Shui was just jumping to conclusions based on a piece of a prescription at that time. It was a normal thing for the Alchemist Sect to produce antidotes and remedies on a daily basis, but Qing Shui had a feeling, that both sects co-existing within the Seven Stars would hardly get along with each other peacefully. Logically speaking, they were destined to be each other’s enemies as one aimed to create poison, while the other strived to cure it.</p>
 <p>“Don’t say that. I’ll be embarrassed. Ah, right. This is the Spiritual Soul Powder. It acts as an antidote, and it’s quite effective too.” Yuan Su took out a silk sachet and passed it to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh, thank you. Right, what do you think about the effect of this antidote compared to the Pure Jade Pellet?” Qing Shui asked as he thanked Yuan Su after receiving the sachet.</p>
 <p>“The Pure Jade Pellet is better of course.” Yuan Su's eyes widened as she replied to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh, also, I have refined some medicinal pills from the recipes you gave me last time. I got lucky, so I kept some of them for you.” Qing Shui took out three types of medicinal pills he had saved for Yuan Su previously and displayed them on the stone table.</p>
 <p>“You really managed to do it?!” This was the second time Yuan Su lost her composure in front of him. However, she quickly recovered from her shocked expression and showed him an embarrassed smile.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you take a look at them? I think, with your capabilities, you can easily tell whether they are authentic.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I didn’t mean it that way. I was just surprised, that’s all. Qing Shui, you are really one of the best alchemists I have ever known. How do you do it at such a young age?” Yuan Su quickly explained as if she had offended him somehow.</p>
 <p>“You are quite exceptional as well. Think a bit more highly of yourself. Perhaps by doing so, you will understand what kind of person I am.” Qing Shui’s casual reply was somewhat correct, but not entirely. Yuan Su was born a genius - she was a natural-born talent. Qing Shui, on the other hand, became adept at alchemy due to many circumstances and factors.</p>
 <p>“For someone like me, who is doing research on medicinal recipes, while I can’t refine even a single medicinal pill using them, to think that way, would be quite inappropriate. You don’t know how painful it is being unable to do so, especially with the alchemical recipes I have worked so hard on for the past few years. I found many alchemists during those times, but none of them were able to refine any of my alchemical recipes successfully. When you couldn’t find anyone, who would truly succeed in refining them, you would be as mad as I am, while thinking that these recipes were utterly useless.” The words coming out of Yuan Su’s mouth were full of bitterness and helplessness.</p>
 <p>“Well, that’s normal. Nothing will ever go well indefinitely. There are always obstacles waiting for you on every path, and there is always something, that will make you feel like you aren’t good enough. Human nature will always be driven by one’s conscience. So, in the same situation, some people will be happy, while others sad.” Qing Shui had profound feelings about these things as he had already experienced them numerous times in his life.</p>
 <p>“Eh, you are still quite young. It seems like you have been through a fair share of troubles yourself.” Yuan Su smiled. The conversation between them became relaxed and casual.</p>
 <p>“I am not young anymore. But I did experience quite a lot of things in the past, especially during the moments when my life hung in the balance. Also, making important decisions during crucial situations can prove very difficult. It took someone’s death for me to realize, that those years of unhappiness were in truth the happier moments of my life.” Qing Shui had indeed encountered numerous deadly situations in his life. He was lucky to have escaped unscathed more than once, so at this stage in life, he had gained numerous insights, which helped him understand things more thoroughly.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su observed Qing Shui’s expression and she noticed, that he looked quite handsome, when he was deep in his thoughts. Realizing how she observed him, she quickly shifted her eyes away from Qing Shui onto the medicinal pills on the table.</p>
 <p>“Initially I thought I could support you through the medicinal pills, but it looks like these Pure Jade Pellets that you had refined will be enough to boost your chances of winning to about 30 percent.” Yuan Su smiled and pushed the Pure Jade Pellets towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“What’s this about?” Qing Shui looked at Yuan Su in confusion.</p>
 <p>“You will need a lot of these antidotes if you want to fight with the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect. Basically, you have to eat one pellet every fifteen minutes for the effect to endure. Give me the extras when you plan on refining more in the future.” Yuan Su smiled as she revealed one of the key points to winning against the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it for a while, then took back half of the Pure Jade Pellets. After all, the Di Clan had many members, who needed precautionary measures against the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect.</p>
 <p>“Is it true that this Meridians Clearing Pellet is ineffective for me?” Yuan Su had never doubted Qing Shui’s medical abilities after she saw how capable he was, but the Meridians Clearing Pellet was essentially useless to her, which was a disheartening revelation.</p>
 <p>“You can try it for yourself right now. I am here, so you don’t have to worry so much.” Qing Shui gave her a pleasant smile. It was better to let her sink into reality rather than telling her that it was ineffective for a millionth time.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was a lady of her own judgement, so she turned to Qing Shui and gave him a nod. Then she took one Meridians Clearing Pellet and swallowed it. Yuan Su could tell by the fresh fragrance of the medicinal pill that this was indeed the Meridians Clearing Pellet, which she had been yearning for all her life.</p>
 <p>A sudden wave of cool air began to rise up inside her body, but it was unfortunate that none of her meridians were cleared, nor the blockages in a few points of her meridians were dissolved. Slowly, the wave of cool air had become hot, causing her face to turn red. The lines on her forehead were beginning to look like a series of crescent moons stacked on top of each other.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui extended his arms and tapped on the ‘central pillar’ in the middle of the spine twice to ease her pain. Her meridians were mostly blocked, so she had to depend on some of the acupoints to relieve her pain instantaneously.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” Yuan Su smiled as she thanked Qing Shui. However, she couldn’t hide the disappointment in her expression. After all, it was one of her lifelong dreams to have her meridians cleared completely, but now that hope had been shattered by the cruel reality.</p>
 <p>“We don’t have much time left. How about this, after the fight is over, we will talk about your treatment, given that I’m still alive at that point.” Qing Shui gave a suggestion to Yuan Su after seeing how dejected she was.</p>
 <p>“Nothing will happen to you. Everyone will be fine.”</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, then I am certain that I can cure your condition.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“It’s not guaranteed that I will succeed, but it is highly possible. However, there’s also a chance that you will choose not to go through the treatment. Well, let’s talk about this later. Think about it in the meantime. But for now, we have to think of ways to win this Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death!”</p>
 <p>“Okay!” Yuan Su had faith, that Qing Shui would be able to treat her condition. She was relieved after overcoming the unpleasant experience from just a moment ago.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su proceeded to take out other medicinal pills for Qing Shui. Most of them could increase the user’s strength, albeit temporarily, by a hundred countries per pellet.</p>
 <p>This type of medicinal pill was considered decent, and most importantly, only those with the strength of 1000 countries and above were allowed to consume these medicinal pellets. For those with that kind of strength, it would mean an extra ten percent boost to their overall power….</p>
 <p>It would be pointless for someone, who had become exceedingly powerful to consume medicinal pills meant for lower realm cultivators. For example, before Qing Shui had a breakthrough to Martial Saint, he was able to reap huge benefits from the Small Revitalizing Pellet and the ungodly Great Revitalizing Pellet. But after he entered the realm of Martial Saints, these pellets became quite obsolete. So, for the Martial Saints to further boost their strength, they would need to consume medicinal pills of the Royal Grade and above.</p>
 <p>The Alchemist Sect of the Seven Stars Country was not known to be adept in the refinement of medicinal pills, that can boost the strength of the user, but they were famous for the development of various antidotes and remedies, that cured wounds and injuries. Otherwise, they would already have joined the circle of outstanding alchemists long ago.</p>
 <p>“Miss Yuan, I was wondering whether you still have some more alchemical recipes on you. It would be ideal if you have the ones, that boost the strength of the user.” Qing Shui was hesitating to ask Yuan Su at first, but he decided to do it anyway.</p>
 <p>Since she had come all the way to meet him, Qing Shui wasn’t sure if she brought any alchemical recipes with her. He was also curious about the number of people, who attempted the refinement of the impractical alchemical recipes, that she developed throughout her career.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I did. I planned to give you some alchemical recipes during our meeting this time. But, we only have about three days left, so I am not sure whether you have any time to spare on refining them. I also brought the necessary herbs and whatnot, but I am missing a few important ingredients that are necessary for one of the alchemical recipes here. At the time, I didn’t know where to look for them.”</p>
 <p>Yuan Su took out some alchemical recipes and a few brocade boxes and placed them on top of the stone table. Each brocade box was imprinted with a label stating the names of the herbs stored inside.</p>
 <p>On one side of the table were three alchemical recipes, that intrigued Qing Shui very much. He was quite excited to read the recipes, so he looked at Yuan Su as a gesture to ask for her permission. She glanced back at him and gave an approving nod.</p>
 <p>The Gale Pellet!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui proceeded in reading the ingredients required for the Gale Pellet recipe. Most of the required ingredients were herbs beyond 1000 years of age, but nothing too peculiar. However, the recipe required a remarkable amount of ingredients.</p>
 <p>When refining medicinal pills, the bigger variety of ingredients was used, the higher the chance of failure during the procedure became.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shifted his focus on the effects listed on the bottom-most page.</p>
 <p>It was quite decent actually. This pellet had the ability to double the speed of the user within the span of fifteen minutes!</p>
 <p>The effect of the pellet could be described as explosive. If the pellet was consumed during a battle, it would change the outcome of the fight immediately. The sudden increase of speed to double of the initial maximum was a terrifying concept.</p>
 <p>He felt the need to refine this recipe immediately despite the absence of the strength-boosting effect. However, the sudden gain of speed was more than enough to catch Qing Shui’s attention, albeit temporarily, it was still considered quite perverted. Qing Shui was also unsure whether the Gale Pellet would be able to overpower the Agility-Enhancing Fruit. Although it would be useless to consume the Agility-Enhancing Fruit right now, it could still boost his speed to about fifty percent temporarily. Both have similar effects, so he thought it would be ideal if the effects of the two different items could stack together, creating an ungodly combination.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then shifted his gaze on the second alchemy recipe that caught his attention. The name of the recipe was quite common.</p>
 <p>The Demonic Beast Advancing Pellet!</p>
 <p>One look at the name of the recipe and Qing Shui was able to tell what kind of effect he could expect from the medicinal pill. However, he had a feeling that this pellet would be different from the conventional advancing pellets he normally fed to his demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the recipe required medical herbs that were at least 3000 years old. Moreover, a few of the ingredients could only be acquired from demonic beasts of the Martial Saint grade. It would also be very expensive to retrieve these ingredients due to the extremely high value of the 3000-year old medical herbs.</p>
 <p>Effect: Ten percent chance of upgrading the grade of the current cultivation realm of the demonic beast. The upgrade is limited within its cultivation realm only!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui studied the effect of the Demonic Beast Advancing Pellet carefully. From his understanding, the pellet would be able to upgrade a Grade One Martial King to a Grade Two Martial King, and a Grade One Martial Saint to a Grade Two Martial Saint. However, it would be impossible to upgrade a demonic beast from the Martial King realm to the Martial Saint realm because the effect could only be effective within the demonic beast’s current cultivation realm.</p>
 <p>Initially, he thought about his Fire Bird when he saw the recipe because it hadn’t gone through another breakthrough for a very long time. Qing Shui was beginning to feel anxious for his Peak Martial King Fire Bird due to its weakness in battle. The Fire Bird would be instantly annihilated if it was to face another demonic beast with the strength of a Grade Five Martial Saint and above.</p>
