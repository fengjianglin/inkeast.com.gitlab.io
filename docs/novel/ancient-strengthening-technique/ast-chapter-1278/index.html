 <p><strong>AST 1278 - Divine Might Dynasty's Intention, Geniuses Are Meant To Be Stomp Down On</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered this introduction. In all, these few talented members of the royalty were about the same level as Fu Yantian and the others. However, there were two middle-aged men who seemed to be very young but a little older than Fu Yantian. They were probably close to 200 years old. After all, even Tian Jiange had reached 100 years old.</p>
 <p>These two men were Fu Tongsheng's most outstanding sons. Of course, Fu Tongsheng had quite number of children. These two had a strength that was between 4,000 to 5,000 suns. One of them was called Fu You, the other, Fu Shui.</p>
 <p>Amongst Fu Tongsheng's grandchildren, three of the most powerful ones here had a strength of 2,000 to 2,500 suns and their age were around 100 years old. To be able to stay in the same area, their abilities must be about the same and were on par with each other.</p>
 <p>Out of the three in the younger generation, the tall and handsome man in the middle was called Fu Cang. He had dashing brows and bright eyes and an expression of disdain. He didn't appear detestable but it wasn't one which people would take a liking to either. In general, Qing Shui tended to be unwilling to take the initiative to talk to people like him.</p>
 <p>As for the other two, the man on the left side to the man seemed to be younger. They also had dashing brows and bright eyes but gave off the feeling of a strong determination. Their gaze seemed to be cool-headed and they seemed to be slightly weaker than Fu Cang. This person's name was like the feeling he exuded, Fu Jian [1].</p>
 <p>The man greeted Qing Shui, giving off the feeling that he was both serious but casual at the same time. He didn't give off a bad feeling but rather, one that made others feel that he could be trusted.</p>
 <p>The man on the right seemed to have a stronger build or rather, appeared to be very fat. If he was outside, it would be hard for one to associate him with the royal family. This person was like the Maitreya, always wearing a smile on his face which made one feel that he was easy to get along with. When Qing Shui saw this fatty, he also smiled and greeted him. He could sense that this fatty's body tempering technique had reached the large success stage and was considered to have quite a good physical disposition.</p>
 <p>This person was called Fu Xiao [2]. Although he was wearing a smile, people like him might be the most dangerous. Earlier on, Qing Shui felt that Fu Xiao's gaze was very deep. If one didn't take a closer look, he would only be able to sense that those thin eye slits appeared to be full of harmless smiles. However, Qing Shui had a powerful spiritual sense and could sense the coldness behind the smiles. That was where the person true's soul was.</p>
 <p>"Come, come, let's all take a seat and have a chat. I believe that Qing Shui must have something to talk to us about today!" Fu Tongsheng smiled and got everyone to sit down.</p>
 <p>Although there were many members of the royalty, this man's status in the royal family was definitely very high or could even be the most mainstream. He should be Fu Clan's pillar. After all, just by seeing the abilities of these people, he could understand many things.</p>
 <p>Fu Rong was right next to Qing Shui. She didn't say anything but just smiled and watched.</p>
 <p>"Grandfather, what level is Mister Qing at?"</p>
 <p>Fu Cang spoke up, his eyes full of disdain, at least, that was what it seemed like to Qing Shui. It might be because he had always been like this. Fu Cang actually felt that Qing Shui's age was younger than himself but appeared to be one seniority higher than himself and thus he didn't find that comfortable.</p>
 <p>"That's right, grandfather. Brother Qing's age should be around the same as ours, right? Is he very powerful? Other than alchemy, is his cultivation very strong as well? I'm very curious. I've always been in admiration for Mister Qing's alchemy skills." Fu Xiao laughed and chipped in.</p>
 <p>Only Fu Jian kept quiet.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood what they were trying to say, that they were dissatisfied with him. However, Fu Xiao had spoken with a soft tone and was full of smiles, thus making it easier for one to accept what he said. As for Fu Cang, he was too straightforward. However, Qing Shui knew that a person like Fu Cang wasn't terrifying. It was people like Fu Xiao that one should be wary of. People who hid daggers behind their smiles were the most dangerous.</p>
 <p>"Haha, I knew that you guys would find this hard to accept. You usually think very highly of yourselves. This is a good chance to bring down your confidence, to let you know that there's always stronger people outside. Qing Shui's age is at least half of yours but he is more than twice as strong as you," Fu Tongsheng said heartily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and didn't say a word. Fu Tongsheng didn't know of his true abilities either or rather, he didn't know what level of cultivators Qing Shui could defeat. Therefore, the reason he said that Qing Shui was more than twice as strong as them should be "overestimating" his abilities.</p>
 <p>"To be so powerful at such a young age... I must get a chance to have a spar with Brother Qing Shui later," Fu Cang smiled and said.</p>
 <p>This was how it was in this world. Everyone could address someone else according to how they wished to. It wasn't an offense to someone of his father's generation. This was also implying that Qing Shui didn't have a right to be of a higher seniority than himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, "Let's forget it. I no longer plan to spar with people in this age group."</p>
 <p>This was a blatant contempt and Fu Cang's countenance turned a little grim. He smiled and said, "Could it be that you're not stronger than me?"</p>
 <p>"It doesn't matter if I'm stronger than you. I'm an alchemist. I'm afraid that if I were to win, what would you think? If you were to be defeated by an alchemist, would you still have the heart to continue with your cultivation? Your heart is very weak, just like a flower that been nurtured with care in a greenhouse and won't be able to stand up to the wind and rain. You haven't understood Uncle Fu's words." Qing Shui said calmly. He didn't think well of Fu Cang and felt that he wouldn't be able to achieve much in the future. He could only be considered a genius when he was with his clan. What Qing Shui didn't know was how long this genius could sustain. If Fu Cang wasn't a member of the royalty, it would already be considered quite good if he could manage to become a Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>"The ones I despise the most are people who don't live up to their reputations. Thank goodness you still have your status as an alchemist." Fu Cang shook his head and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this person wasn't a stubborn person. Rather, it was more of because he had yet to meet people from his age group who were much stronger than himself. Even if there were some from his age group who were stronger than him, they wouldn't be that much stronger. Therefore, Fu Cang didn't believe him. Moreover, Qing Shui was still an alchemist.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Fu, should I talk first or do you want to have a say first?" Qing Shui smiled and said. He didn't want to make it appear bad for Fu Clan's younger generations. Right now, he’d only need to reveal his most powerful abilities to be able to astonish them. However, he didn't try to.</p>
 <p>"Go ahead. I'm curious what matter you have to be looking for me about." Fu Tongsheng smiled and indicated for Qing Shui to go ahead.</p>
 <p>"What I'm going to say is related to the Desolate Sect. Uncle Fu should be aware of Desolate Sect's actions, right?" Qing Shui looked at Fu Tongsheng and said.</p>
 <p>"Oh, I do know a little. I wonder what about Desolate Sect do you want to talk about?" Fu Tongsheng was even more curious now.</p>
 <p>"The Desolate Sect has a pair of powerful brothers that are the direct descendants of the Lü family. It's said that they have the intentions to conspire and get their hands on the entire Western Oxhe Continent. The people from the Desolate Sect are merciless and tyrannical and they lust after beauty. The reason I'm here is to get some powers together to form an alliance. In the future, we can deal with the Desolate Sect together." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Fu Tongsheng.</p>
 <p>"Oh, I know about this too and have been worrying about it as well. The Divine Might Dynasty is relatively close to the Desolate Sect. But I wonder what powers are you able to contact to form the alliance?" Fu Tongsheng continued to look at Qing Shui calmly.</p>
 <p>"I'm still on the lookout and have come to approach Uncle Fu first." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Fu Tongsheng.</p>
 <p>"Then our Divine Might Dynasty is the first? Are you able to represent the Heaven Secrets Academy? Who is the person who initiated this?" Fu Cang spoke up once again.</p>
 <p>"I can represent the Heaven Secrets Academy. Since I'm here, of course I'm the initiator of this proposal. Why, do you think you're able to take on the job?" Qing Shui wasn't anxious as he looked at Fu Cang. Right now, it was very hard for Fu Cang to agitate him since the gap between them was far too wide and he wouldn't be able to cause any sparks between them.</p>
 <p>"You don't even dare to accept my challenge and you're thinking of forming an alliance to go up against the Desolate Sect and get the alliance to listen to you? You ought to show off some of your capabilities." Fu Cang saw that Fu Tongsheng didn't say anything and thus continued.</p>
 <p>"Since you must know how strong I am, it won't reflect well for me to continue to give in. If you can stand up right now, it'll be considered my loss." After saying that Qing Shui used his powerful spirit energy to confine Fu Cang.</p>
 <p>This was a small lotus flower and it just nicely surrounded Fu Cang.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's control over the spirit energy allowed him to control the size of the object he portrayed. Right now, even if he were to remain seated to confine someone, it wouldn't affect the people around him.</p>
 <p>"I shall see what abilities you have." With that Fu Cang unleashed an explosive aura. He felt extremely infuriated when he knew that Qing Shui wanted to confined him with spirit energy.</p>
 <p>It was because even if a person was twice as strong as another, he wouldn't be able to confine the opponent with spirit energy. Before he could completely let out his fury, Fu Cang realized that something was amiss. It was because the lotus print around him didn't budge at all and there wasn't even a ripple.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>White Jade Dragon Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, picked up the cup of tea and took a sip. He watched calmly at Fu Cang who was still unable to stand up but he didn't say a word.</p>
 <p>"Sigh, Qing Shui, you can release him now. Even my judgment was wrong." Fu Tongsheng was first astonished and taken aback but he eventually let out a sigh and spoke. The moment Qing Shui had used the confinement, he suddenly sensed Qing Shui's powerful spirit energy. It was a very strange one that made even him felt a little helpless.</p>
 <p>"Grandfather!"</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui released his hold, Fu Cang let out a weak cry. To be unable to even break through his spiritual confinement... Their difference was not longer by just a bit. Moreover, this person was so young. An unprecedented feeling of setback struck him down to every single cell. He felt a little groggy.</p>
 <p>"Cang`er!" Fu Tongsheng suddenly let out a loud bellow.</p>
 <p>Fu Cang suddenly looked at Fu Tongsheng in astonishment.</p>
 <p>"You're a man, a member of our Fu Clan. For you to cultivate to this level, you have gone through a lot of stumbles along the way. I know that the shock from today is tremendous but this misfortune could be a blessing in disguise. If you're able to get past this hurdle, you'll be able to gain great benefits. Even if you can't get past this, you don't have to think too much about it either. It is because even without this setback, your cultivation has already reached a bottleneck and it's hard for you to progress any further. Therefore, you should be feeling happy. This is an opportunity," Fu Tongsheng spoke each word heavily and clearly.</p>
 <p>Fu Cang's expression continued to be that of dejection but it was much better than his groggy state from earlier. However, it wasn't that easy to get past this setback. Fu Tongsheng's words from earlier weren't just directed to Fu Cang but was for his other descendants as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had only one single thought. What were geniuses? Geniuses were meant to be stomped on! They were meant to be dealt blows and were stepping stones!</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, it's rare for me to make a wrong judgment. This is the first time I've been wrong about a person as young as yourself. I now have a feeling that those geniuses from the Desolate Sect aren't as monstrous as you," Fu Tongsheng smiled and said. It was unknown whether that smile was a bitter one or a happy one.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Fu, you flatter me. You should still have a chance to encounter others in the future. I wonder if Uncle Fu is supportive of my proposal to form an alliance?" Qing Shui smiled and said politely.</p>
 <p>[1] The 'Jian' in Fu Jian's name can mean determination or persistence.</p>
 <p>[2] The 'Xiao' in Fu Xiao's name can mean smile.</p>
