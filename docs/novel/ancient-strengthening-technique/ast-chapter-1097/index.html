 <p><strong>AST 1097 Formation Immortal Sect, Barging through the Immortal Obstruction Formation</strong></p>
 <p>The Northern Sea City was very beautiful. The Northern Sea was located on the line separating regions of different temperatures. The places on the south side had four seasons, with periods of both hot and cold. On the other hand, on the north side, especially in the far north, the places would have cold winter days all year around.</p>
 <p>"We'll rest and reorganize ourselves here. Let's stay here for two days before we continue on our way!" Qing Shui and the others landed in a huge square in Northern Sea City. There were many people and demonic beasts around.</p>
 <p>The Northern Sacred Lu Continent was very big but the population wasn't sparsely distributed. The World of the Nine Continents was very huge but it was segregated into cities and wilderness. The wilderness was the demonic beasts' territories where countless of them would gather together in large groups. Other than some adventurers or people who were traveling, there were only demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>In the wilderness, large cities would appear. Both the city itself and some of the wilderness around it would be within the city's influence. Large reinforcing walls would be built around the city. This was primarily because there were countless cultivators in the cities. In order for them to protect their family and their own safety, they would fight against the demonic beasts outside that were thinking of entering the cities. Although they were on opposite sides with the demonic beasts, a lot of what they ate and wore came from demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Humans and demonic beasts had been engaged in battles for countless years and every day, there would be cities drowned by demonic beasts and some new ones created which wandering and homeless people would move into.</p>
 <p>Things like these were very common in this world. The population in this world was immeasurable and there could be more than a billion people in each city. After all, the scale of the cities in this world was on an entirely different scale. There were over 100,000 cities in the world and there were also some unique cities which were extremely prosperous.</p>
 <p>Although there were many people, the cities were spacious enough and thus the people's standard of living rose gradually. Even ordinary people had strong physical bodies and had a strong value for manual labor.</p>
 <p>"Father, let's go take a look at the Northern Sea later!" Luan Luan was in a very good mood and said this the moment that they landed.</p>
 <p>"We'll have to find an inn first!" Qing Shui planned to stay here for two days, so it was better for them to find a place to settle down first.</p>
 <p>"Since we'll be taking a look at the Northern Sea, why don't we just find an inn near there? If there really isn't any there, it won't be a bad idea to camp on the beach either." Luan Luan gave it some thought and suggested.</p>
 <p>"Alright, we'll go with your plan." Qing Shui smiled and answered.</p>
 <p>Yiye Tian smiled as he looked at Qing Shui and Luan Luan, feeling very consoled. It was his daughter's blessing to have met Qing Shui. Additionally, he was very clear about the relationship between Luan Luan and Qing Shui. Yiye Jiange had told him all about it previously. Moreover, he had also seen their interactions during the period they had been together. He felt very much at ease.</p>
 <p>Parental love was very great, without any hint of selfishness to them. Therefore, seeing someone else treating his own daughter well made Yiye Tian truly feel happy and thankful. Moreover, the person in question was his own younger brother-in-law.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui executed the Nine Continents Steps and the group had appeared in the north parts of the Northern Sea City. Of course, Qing Shui had to adjust the distance to travel or else they would arrive above the Northern Sea.</p>
 <p>After arriving, they rented a huge and luxurious horse carriage and headed for the Northern Sea.</p>
 <p>They could soon see the Northern Sea from a distance. Right now, they were traveling toward the coast. The coast was several kilometers away from the shores and they could see people along the shores.</p>
 <p>"Brother, please stop here!" Qing Shui looked out of the carriage and saw that they had already arrived next to the coast, so he smiled and spoke to the middle-aged driver.</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>After paying, the group alighted. The streets here were very curvy, giving rise to a whole different charm. There was a hint of a fishy odor coming from the sea breeze. It wasn't a nice smell but it wasn't disgusting either.</p>
 <p>There were many inns in the area. Although they might not be directly situated next to each other, there would be one within a hundred meters of another. Because the place was situated next to the sea, many people would come here every day. This was why this line of work was extremely prosperous and would include providing both food and accommodations.</p>
 <p>Deity's Abode!</p>
 <p>They hadn't walked very far when they came across an inn which didn't seem very big but was of a very high quality. Qing Shui memorized the name right away because it sounded too powerful. Deity's Abode. Who would dare to use a name like this?</p>
 <p>"Let's see if they still have rooms available here. If there are, then let's just stay here!" Qing Shui looked at the handwriting on the signboard and felt that the owner must be someone exceptional.</p>
 <p>"There are words here?"</p>
 <p>Before they reached the entrance, they saw a standing sign with some words written on them.</p>
 <p>"This place is profound. Ordinary people shouldn't enter. Enter at your own risk!"</p>
 <p>These few simple words caused many people to depart after stopping only for a short moment. Just then, a voice rang out, "Trying to mislead people with strange ideas. I shall enter and take a look today."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to see a handsome young man with dashing brows and bright eyes. He had a graceful disposition and his figure was slender. He was wearing a battle armor that looked a lot like a hauberk, which made him appear to be very valiant. However, his expression was too arrogant, making others feel uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>"Yin`er, stop it. Don't charge in recklessly. Some time ago, a Martial Emperor expert had attempted to enter. Guess what happened to him?"</p>
 <p>A powerful voice rang out and a figure appeared next to the young man. This was an unflustered middle-aged man. He seemed mature and appeared to be gentle. Despite this, he seemed to have great authority and a hint of strictness. This combination made him appear to be very manly.</p>
 <p>Some people in the surroundings stopped. After all, this was a prosperous region and many cultivators were very proud and did not know what fear was. However, when some weak cultivators attempted to enter, they would be sent flying out. They would end up being covered in dust, but they wouldn't suffer any injuries.They would just look very pathetic.</p>
 <p>"Third Uncle, what happened to that Martial Emperor?" The young man called Yin`er seemed to be very curious.</p>
 <p>"Haha, this inn isn't open to the public. However, those who can enter will be hosted.The quality here is the best and the place is the safest. It's just that there are too few people who can enter. The last time, a Early Grade Martial Emperor tried to enter but he came out with heavy injuries not long after. This is a mysterious formation but it won't kill you. The stronger the person who enters, the greater the damage suffered. Ordinary cultivators would only end up covered in dust with no injuries but those who are powerful could possibly sustain heavy injuries." The middle-aged man smiled and spoke up.</p>
 <p>"Third Uncle, is there no one who can enter?" The young man seemed to not be able to accept this.</p>
 <p>"Of course not. Those who excel in formations might be able to enter. In fact, there would be one or two cultivators who would be able to enter this place every few days, or possibly even every day." The middle-aged man smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Third Uncle. You excel in formations. Are you able to enter?"</p>
 <p>"I have never tried. This is the Formation Immortal Sect's Immortal Obstruction Formation!" The middle-aged man seemed to be mumbling to himself.</p>
 <p>"Formation Immortal Sect... So this Deity's Abode is actually the property of the Formation Immortal Sect." The young man looked toward Deity's Abode and exclaimed.</p>
 <p>"Formation Immortal Sect?" Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange, Yu He, and the other ladies with a puzzled look.</p>
 <p>Yu He smiled and said, "Formation Immortal Sect is a very mysterious sect and rumor has it that they are also a terrifying existence in the other Four Continents. The ancient teleportation array which transports one to the other Four Continents is controlled by them."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. To think that the Formation Immortal Sect even controlled the ancient teleportation array. He didn't know if the teleportation array leading to the other Four Continents was a two-way one or just for one-way transportation.</p>
 <p>“This Formation Immortal Sect must be considered a powerful influence in the Northern Sacred Lu Continent!” Qing Shui hadn't seemed to have heard of an existence like the Formation Immortal Sect since he had come to the Northern Sacred Lu Continent.</p>
 <p>"Formation Immortal Sect tends to not participate in the worldly affairs but neither would anyone dare to offend them. They are an extraordinary power and seem to be an existence which is independent from the rest of the world." Yu He said softly.</p>
 <p>"I'll go try and it out. You guys wait for me here." Qing Shui smiled and said to the ladies. After knowing that this Formation Immortal Sect was the one controlling the ancient teleportation array, Qing Shui was even more eager to go.</p>
 <p>"Be careful."</p>
 <p>They knew that this formation wouldn't bring him any fatal danger, but they were still concerned.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, it'll be fine!"</p>
 <p>With that, Qing Shui entered the formation. The moment he did, he felt that the world had changed. This place seemed as if there were many strong currents while Qing Shui was like a small boat on the huge waves, pressurized by a tremendous aura in the formation. Even his abilities were affected.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a huge mountain cliff appeared before him, coming towards him like a small mountain with a tremendous aura. Qing Shui smiled and struck out with a punch.</p>
 <p>Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>A mysterious power was sent out, pushing away this cliff that was like a small mountain. This was what it meant by overcoming a great force with a small one. It was one of the essences of Taichi.</p>
 <p>Next, bigger cliffs appeared in greater quantities. Qing Shui dodged them easily and moved around the waves easily like a lighthearted fish with his Five Elements Steps.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved around without panicking. He knew that the environment had changed.</p>
 <p>This thought had just passed by in his mind when the miasma appeared around him. Everywhere around him was filled with extremely toxic stuff, coming at Qing Shui from all directions. This horrible stench would cause one's stomach to hurl. There was various toxic stuff, including toads that were the size of buildings which were dripping with disgusting venom...</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>Faint white smoke appeared around Qing Shui, as if it was purifying the place. The toxic stuff in the surroundings turned into white smoke and disappeared. Where Qing Shui walked, the toxic stuff in that area would disappear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked several li and then the world changed again. Several tens of powerful cultivators appeared, each of them like people who lived secluded lives in the mountains. They swung about their huge staffs and dashed toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't be bothered to say anything and sent out his Nine Continents Mountain toward them. Suddenly, the world fell quiet. The formations suddenly flashed and disappeared. Qing Shui appeared in a room which seemed to be like a study. It appeared very rustic but also very dignified. Qing Shui looked toward the center of the room where a man stood, smiling at him. This man also seemed to be middle-aged but at the same time, appeared younger. He was wearing plain white clothes and appeared very casual. However, he gave off a faint divinely aura.</p>
 <p>Deity's Abode... This person's aura was really a good match with the name of the place.</p>
 <p>"Hello. I seek your forgiveness for barging in here!" Qing Shui smiled and cupped his fists.</p>
 <p>"It's fine, it's fine. How do I address you?" The man walked over and returned the greeting with a smile.</p>
