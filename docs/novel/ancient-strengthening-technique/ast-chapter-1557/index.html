 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The opponent was obviously shocked upon seeing the Dragon Slaying Beast. It was obvious that he was clear about how formidable the Dragon Slaying Beast was. He gazed on the Golden Cloud Lions that were at unease before moving on to settle his eyes on the tiny body of the Dragon Slaying Beast. He was a bit puzzled. Compared to the Golden Cloud Lion, the Dragon Slaying Beast could already be considered a pocket-sized monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he might have heard of the Dragon Slaying Beast before, he was still a bit unconvinced with its strength. Despite how fierce it might be, what could it do with such a small body to the Golden Cloud Lions that were almost the size of a small mountain peak?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pulled out a long Primordial Flame Dragon Whip with his hands. As he swung the whip, a grey dragon flashed past the air, creating traces of black shadows with it. Loud exploding noises could be heard constantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kong-kong…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous Golden Cloud Lions let out huge roars possibly due to the boost in morale given by the old man. They formed a straight line together as they charged towards Qing Shui. While doing so, they were also spitting out golden liquid drops like a drizzle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five Elements Metal Essence Droplet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a metal attributed essential object. It could be considered one of the stickiest objects across the world. Once a person made contact with it, they would suffer the fate of having their body eroded, letting the droplets infiltrate their inner parts. The droplets were at very high temperature. The droplets could be seen shining with a bright golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Continents Mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui realized that the Nine Continents Mountain was very useful. The enormous mountain stood right in front of both Qing Shui and Qin Qing protecting them. Qing Shui also didn’t fear that the Five Elements Metal Essence Droplet would damage his Nine Continents Mountain as there were very few things which would actually be capable of damaging it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu-pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A continuous yet intensive wave of explosions was heard. Qing Shui felt that it was unnecessary for him to attempt to see if he could block the attacks of the Five Elements Metal Essence Droplets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa-pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Primordial Flame Dragon Whip in his control, Qing Shui whipped both of the Golden Cloud Lions. The Golden Cloud Lions were metal attributed demonic beasts. In other words, Qing Shui’s Primordial Flame Dragon Whip had just the right attribute to suppress it. Adding the fact that Qing Shui’s attacks were quite strong at the moment, with just merely two whip lashings, he managed to cause the lions to get blown away backwards. They immediately let out miserable howls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Almost at the same time Qing Shui unleashed his Primordial Flame Dragon Whip, he also used the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. Though the Golden Cloud Lions might have been decent creatures, they didn’t really pique Qing Shui’s interest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s fourth Heavenly Technique enabled him to increase the unleashing speed of his Battle Techniques. Not only so, it also shortened the time he needed to recover for his attacks. The enormous Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines immediately enveloped both of the Golden Cloud Lions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Prior to this, Qing Shui had managed to catch both the Golden Cloud Lions with his preemptive strike from before. Though the Golden Cloud Lion might be strong, it has poor defense and only decent speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, they ran into Qing Shui who just happened to have the right attribute to suppress them. Not only was he fast, he was also very sturdy. He executed his offensive moves in the most unpredictable way, making it almost impossible for his opponents to defend effectively against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the meantime, the Dragon Slaying Beast was at the back reserving its energy. It immediately leaped forward and drilled its way through the Blood-thirsty Demonic Vines. In just a short while, a miserable howl belonging to that of a beast could already be heard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this happened too suddenly, almost in the span of a breath. The two old men couldn’t do anything but stand there and watch as the two demonic beasts were slaughtered by the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only now that the two old men realized just how formidable the Dragon Slaying Beast was. The size wasn’t important.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was only the beginning. The two old men were no ordinary warriors either. They were beings who respectively held the titles of Demonic and Heaven Slayer Old Ancestors in the Gu Clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The death of the Golden Cloud Lions triggered both of the old men. But having experienced through various battles for so many years, they were still strong mentally. They looked calm on the outside and were gazing at Qing Shui and Qin Qing with serious expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two young men had already far surpassed the people of their age in terms of strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they weren’t strong enough to eliminate them, it would be best not to make enemies of them. The two old men were considered to be people of authority in the Gu Clan. Unfortunately, sometimes, this was how humans tended to be. They might drown themselves in obsession. By the time they truly realized what they did, it would have been to late for them to turn back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two old men used axes as their weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the enormous axe, the battle techniques consisted in the elements of explosiveness and sharpness. Unlike the people from before, it was really normal. The two old men were fighting by relying on their own strength. In fact, they were also quite excited to battle with Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui once again took out the Golden Battle Halberd and forged ahead towards their attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It went without saying that weakening his opponents came as one of the priorities. Qing Shui would never try to go head to head against his opponents on what they’re good at with his weaknesses. After weakening his opponents, he felt quite assured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Stances of the Ancient Divine Battle Technique, Phoenix Finger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey axe which the old man was holding was also no ordinary weapon. For the time being, weapons of lower tiers were completely matchless against Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd. From the fact that the axe hadn’t been pierced after colliding a few times with the Golden Battle Halberd, it could be seen that the old man’s axe was of outstanding qualities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Qing Shui was starting to get upset with the fact that the axe hadn’t been pierced, it finally happened. Unfortunately, its effect wasn’t as good as how he had thought for it to be.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man looked at his axe with both his eyes widely opened in disbelief. He had always valued this axe more than his own life. Now that a hole had already been pierced through the axe, its strength would naturally be reduced significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Open Mountain Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man displayed a face of anger. He swung his enormous axe towards Qing Shui, and as he did so, an enormous shadowing cloud emerged along with it. It was a magnified image of the axe and was about a hundred meters tall.&nbsp;</span></p>

It now looked just like a corporeal material. After that, it sliced its way towards Qing Shui like a mountain that was about to topple over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In return, Qing Shui abruptly shot his Golden Battle Halberd into the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique, Mountain Break!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a golden shadow shout out of the Golden Battle Halberd. It was not in the least inferior to the enlarged image of the axe. It shot out just like an enormous golden. dragon. It displayed a dominant aura which felt as if even the blue dome of the heavens was going to be pierced through by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous shadow disappeared. So did the golden image released by the Golden Battle Halberd. Qing Shui gazed at the old man. His eyes were heated with battle intent. The old man on the other hand, looked a bit depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For someone at his age to be almost, or rather, inferior to that of a warrior younger than him, he couldn’t help but felt a sense of failure across his entire body. From his perspective, if he had been at the same age as Qing Shui, he would have been pinched to death with his thumb alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a blessing to encounter a worthy opponent. At the moment, this was how Qing Shui was feeling.The more he battled with the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand, the more fierce he became.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man on the other hand, was getting weaker and weaker. In fact, he even got injured twice in the middle of their showdown. Holes could be spotted all across his axe. It was a really tragic sight. The Golden Battle Halberd was indeed the destroyer of all Divine Weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing had the other old man completely suppressed. Initially, Qing Shui was worried about Qin Qing. But now, he was able to tell that she had yet to go all out and show her true power in battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd managed to pierce through the old man’s heart very easily. However, Qing Shui was stunned because of it. The old man didn’t try to dodge, nor did he try to resist it. He intentionally let Qing Shui pierce him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you promise me one thing?” Blood could be seen flowing out of the old man’s mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Say it, I can promise you if it is within my acceptable range.” Qing Shui was very upset. He hated this kind of feeling. It would have been better if his opponent just died in the battle. Though Qing Shui might have known that he would be able to beat this old man, when his opponents chose to talk to him using this kind of method, he would begin to feel as if he owed his opponent a debt, which upset him alot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please don’t annihilate the entire Gu Clan!” The old man mustered all his strength just to say this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So long as the Gu Clan stops trying to seek trouble with Qin King Manor, we won’t have that much time to kill people.” Qing Shui said after a few thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the old men died. The other old man on the other hand, looked a bit depressed. However, Qin Qing chose to not kill him. After remaining stationary for quite a while, she shook her head, “Leave now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected for Qin Qing to let the old man go. He looked at her in confusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t look at me like that, I hate killing people. He doesn’t have long to live.” Qin Qing shook his head, let out a sigh and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you want to continue battling?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t think it’s necessary for us to continue battling anymore. But if anyone was to show interest for a battle, we may still have to continue battling.” Qin Qing looked down at the arena.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below the arena, after a short moment of silence, it once again became flooded with noises of the audience’s discussions. When the battles were taking place on the arena, the audience was dead quiet. But once the battle dragged on, they would start to discuss about it. Normally, it was the noisiest after the battle finished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To think that even the Battle-Axe Old Ancestor from the Gu Clan lost… There is no one else to compete against. Nothing can stop Qin King Manor on their way to their most glorious moment now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s not possible. Though Fairy Qin may be a member of Qin King Manor, the young man, from what I know, is an outsider. For him to have this level of cultivation must mean that he has a decent family background. In the future, it is likely that Fairy Qin will leave with him. By then, Qin King Manor would have lost a daughter with a formidable cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter what, Fairy Qin is a member of Qin King Manor. Even if she was to leave together with this young man, they would still be very powerful. Who would try to dig his own grave?”</span></p>

Since exterminating all of them was already out of the question, it would be for the best if they could show some sympathy to their enemies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After waiting for about half an hour, Qing Shui and Qin Qing left. They had achieved their goals. Any smart person would know what they should do after this incident.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are we going home first or?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s head home first. I would like to have some rest. My head has been in a total mess for the past few days.” Qin Qing said after a few moments of thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was aware that it had to do with the incidents related to Qin Ying. It had caused quite a huge impact on Qin Qing. Actually, even Qing Shui, merely from the thought of it, felt as if his heart was clogged up. Just like that, a pure and beautiful girl was gone forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time would wash away everything, so would it change everything. Qing Shui still had things which he needed to do. It might be a good idea for him to make a temporary departure. There was no longer anything for him to be worried about here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time they were back in Qin King Manor they realized that something around the place had changed. It was a kind of feeling. It felt as if Qin King Manor itself was becoming more and more formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was it a kind of aura, or a kind of manner which only royal blood members of the royal clan were able to display?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of thing was just like a magnetic field. Though it might be filled with mysteries, it was an actual existence. It’s similar to a palace which countless people had their beliefs in. Though faint, a boundless, enormous aura could be felt from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was aware that this might have to do with the fact that a lot of people has had their attention on Qin King Manor. At the moment, Qin King Manor had earned even more respect from the public than ever before. It was just like a kind of inspiration which people used to mention while in his previous incarnation. It was a kind of aura resembling that of an emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, back when they were in Moonwolf Island, quite a lot clan members from Qin King Manor attended the challenge. As soon as Qing Shui stepped into the house, Qin Shan immediately invited him and Qin Qing to the main hall. The food had been prepared. Everyone was ready to have a reunion dinner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Shui and Qin Qing agreed to it without much thought. However, before they enjoyed their dinner, they would have to take a shower and change their clothes first. Qing Shui came out earlier and hence, he decided to wait for her downstairs. The banquet was still being prepared. It was impossible for everything to be done as soon as they came back. It was more sensible for them to only start getting things ready after Qing Shui and Qin Qing were back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s a well-known fact that women took a long time to shower. Indeed it was true, the majority of women would take longer to shower than men. Qin Qing finally came down after Qing Shui waited there for at least half an hour.</span></p>
