 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2323 - To Think That He Is the Massacre Battle God</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This tall, thin man was too skinny, as if he only had skin and bones. Moreover, he was very pale. Qing Shui smiled when he noticed this. He was almost like the exact same replica of a Battle God in his memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the Massacre Battle God's Inheritor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. He hadn't expected that the Massacre Battle God would be like this. Most of them tended to have their power sealed, and to become powerful, they must undo the seal. Undoing the seal would strengthen the Massacre Battle God’s abilities by half at least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Massacre Battle God! Just from the name alone could one assume that this was a very bloodthirsty Battle God. The Massacre Battle God was the Battle God with the nature closest to a Demon King. The stronger the inheritor, the closer he would resemble a Demon King. In fact, he might potentially become the Massacre Demon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, the Massacre Battle God's primary cultivation technique was powerful. Powerful in the context that it could strengthen the user tremendously, and it could also suppress their bloodthirsty nature. Therefore, there wasn't an actual need to be too worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The greatest problem for the Massacre Battle God was the undoing of the seal. If the seal wasn't undone, the Massacre Battle God's strength would only be about the same as how the Might Strength Battle God had been—being able to only unleash 20% or less of their strength. However, it was very difficult to undo the seal for the Mighty Strength Battle God. There might not even be one case of undoing the seal even across 1,000 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was very happy. He was right to make this trip. He had really found a treasure. He already had the Mighty Strength Battle God on his side, and now, there was the Massacre Battle God. In the future, his Divine Palace would be able to put up a fight against the Nine Continents Divine Palace and also go up against the Nine Continents Demon Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was the Golden Battle God himself and was a spiritual existence amongst Battle Gods. He was absolutely essential. The Massacre Battle God would be ranked next after the Golden Battle God, and the Mighty Strength Battle God would also be ranked amongst the top. Therefore, Qing Shui felt that his foundations were going to be established very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmmm, you are from the Chi Clan?" The Violet Battle God looked at Qing Shui in surprise. He clearly recognized him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at the third person. This person appeared very ordinary, and his inheritance was also ordinary as hell. He was the Speed Battle God’s inheritor. He was a control-type Battle God specializing in agility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm a Battle God Inheritor, so I've come to take a look." Qing Shui smiled and said. He didn't say he was a member of the Chi Clan, but he didn't say he wasn't either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh? Are you here to join our Divine Palace? That's really great!" the Speed Battle God said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, it can't be that there's only the three of you, right?" Qing Shui couldn't sense any other auras around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmm, Only the three of us." the Violet Battle God said, seemingly a little embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, I'll go straight to the point. I'm here to invite you to join me. The Divine Palace I joined previously now has quite a good foundation, and if the three of you were to join us, we'll be able to put up a fight even against the Nine Continents Divine Palace," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A match for the Nine Continents Divine Palace? This seems a little impractical!" The Massacre Battle God frowned as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I didn't have a lot of confidence previously, but it's not that I'm not confident at all. Now that I've seen the three of you, my confidence has increased by a lot." The more Qing Shui looked at this tall, thin man, the stranger he felt. The Massacre Battle God looked like the White Impermanence[1].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Us? We really can't do it. We're only a second-rate or even third-rate force in this Eight Desolates Region," the Violet Battle God said. He was a little embarrassed by his own statement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's fine for us to join you. We already had the intention to join a stronger Divine Palace if we happened to encounter one," the Massacre Battle God said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That’s awesome. By the way, I'm able to let you regain the vigor of the Massacre Battle God." Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Massacre Battle God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Massacre Battle God had been very calm previously, he seemed to be very agitated now to the point of trembling. He looked at Qing Shui in disbelief, "You can undo my seal?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I should be able to!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Massacre Battle God's seal wasn't very difficult to undo. The greatest problem was being unable to find the variable to undo the seal, like for example, those Treasure Pagodas. Treasured Pagodas were precious to begin with, but under the situation where a person hadn't gotten it to recognize him or her as their owners, they would only be useless items. Under ordinary circumstances, one wouldn't know the variable to activate the Treasure Pagodas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Massacre Battle God became very agitated. It was only after a while before he said, "If you can really undo the seal for me, I'll listen to whatever you say."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled and shook his head, "I don't wish to control others. We're all Battle God Inheritors. This is a matter of affinity. In my Divine Palace, everyone is as close as brothers and sisters. Come with me to the Chi Clan. There are a few Battle God Inheritors over there as well. You'll find out after going there."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, we'll pack up!" The Massacre Battle God was straightforward with this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Massacre Battle God made the decision, no one else objected. They packed up very quickly since there wasn’t much to pack. When Qing Shui saw them walk over, he smiled and said, "We're on opposing sides with the Divine Rain Sect. If you were to come with me now, aren't you scared that you'll be dealt with by the Divine Rain Sect?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A little, but for some reason, we believe that you'll be able to deal with the Divine Rain Sect," The Massacre Battle God grinned and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha, since you believe me, then come with me. Oh, right. Where's the Demon Gate here? It'll be good to wipe out the Demon Gate in passing." Qing Shui suddenly recalled that there was a Demon Gate in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, then let's go. The Demon Gate also has three people there." The Violet Battle God was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the years, the three of them had been constantly fighting against the Demon Gate's three Demon Kings. But neither side could come as a clear winner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eight Desolates City's Demon Gate wasn't far from the Divine Palace. However, it was still several hundred lis away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The local Demon Gate was like a castle. When Qing Shui and the three Battle Gods arrived, the people from the Demon Gate sensed the Battle God's aura and thus came out from the castle. They held their weapons as if they were ready to just fight it out. It had always been like this in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst the three black-clothed men, the person in the lead was a non-human species. Qing Shui was stunned. This man's figure was tall and muscular, and he had a pair of long and thick arms. He held a huge club that was as thick as a human’s leg, and he appeared very valiant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The three of you... Haven’t you guys had enough? No wait, it's four of you now. Why? Do you think that with one more person, you'll be able to win against us?" said the man in a low and muffled voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't say anything and charged out directly toward the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're courting death!"</span></p>
