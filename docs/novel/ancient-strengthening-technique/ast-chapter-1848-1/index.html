 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was quite fast when it came to preparing dishes. There was porridge and also a few medicinal cuisines. He also prepared some soup. Meats came in a relatively small quantity. Back in his previous incarnation, it was known that after birth, a woman should drink more soup as it would bring about the most effects on their body. Of course, meat was also a necessity to keep their body healthy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui only remembered that the Vampiric Empress mainly fed on blood by the time he was almost done with preparing the dishes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, he was rushing to prepare her some food but now, he didn’t know if they could actually be of use to her. Qing Shui was a bit lost on what he should do as he slowly carried the soup into her room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It smells great!” The Vampiric Empress became delighted when she saw Qing Shui entering the room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Erm… I seem to have forgotten that this isn’t really what you eat. Why don’t you take some of my blood instead?” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a rare sight to see the Vampiric Empress revealing a gentle expression on her face. It looked very natural. She then said, “It’s not that we don’t eat food, we just take in blood solely for the purpose of cultivating ourselves. Because of the way our body works, by taking in blood, it can help us to improve our strength. Compared to the those who don’t feed on blood, our strength can increase ten times faster than theirs. This is also one of the innate talents us Vampiric Tribe is born with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, I see. Alright then, why don’t you try some of my soup? For all you know, its effect might be even better than when you take in the Blood Essence of those Spiritual Beasts.” With the bowl of soup in his hand, Qing Shui sat down on the side of the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were up to millions of different tribes across the continent. Each and every one of them had unique abilities of their own. They were very natural existences. Just like how a bird was supposed to fly and fish was supposed to swim, each of them had things which they specialized in. As to who could make it to the top, it would depend on their wills and also their destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I despise sucking human’s blood. Other than yours, I am sure that I won’t take in a human’s blood.” The Vampiric Empress said to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was just about to say that I have got enough blood to spare. Tell me when you feel like sucking it. The same goes for my Blood Essence. It’s up to you whether you want to take in my blood or my Blood Essence.” Qing Shui said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress blushed. She couldn’t help but shout, “Is it that difficult for you to try to not take advantage of me for even a second? I realized that you were a lot different compared to how you were before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took up the spoon and smiled as he held the soup near the Vampiric Empress, “Here, have some soup. We will discuss this matter later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress subconsciously opened her mouth. She only realized that she was being fed by him when the soup was already in her mouth. Before this, she found it very natural and didn’t find anything wrong about it. For a moment, she was surprised by her own actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui however, was very happy. This woman didn’t actually repel him. Since the first sip was successful, he figured he would have ways to feed her the entire soup.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress wanted to drink it herself, but Qing Shui wouldn’t allow it. Since she didn’t manage to persuade Qing Shui, she could only embarrassingly let him fed her the entire soup. The soup tasted great. She was surprised that Qing Shui was capable of cooking such a delicious meal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One mere soup managed to get the two even closer with each other. Initially, with the birth of their daughter, they were supposed to already have a firm relationship established between each other. However, there were also some other factors which were still required to improve the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his previous incarnation, some couples would leave each other even after their children were grown up. There was no law that forced a man to only have one wife in this world. Hence, the principle which he tried to stick to was that as long as his women didn’t intend to leave him, no one could ever force her to do so. If she ever wanted to leave, he would see as it was out of her own will. Qing Shui would never want his women to leave him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing which he cared about the most was his family and his affections. Up to a certain extent, affections would develop into a family. The children would be the middle and connect two completely unrelated people together, making them the dearest people they had for each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After three days, Qing Shui helped the brat to perform the Constitution Nurturing. Back then, the Vampiric Empress was very worried. She knew that Qing Shui wouldn’t harm his own daughter. Nevertheless, she was still unable to settle down her worries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To ease her from her worries, Qing Shui first helped her perform the Constitution Nurturing. This had let the Vampiric Empress ease off all the worries she had in her heart. The Constitution Nurturing which he performed for her had helped her gain lots of benefits. Her foundation, as well as strength, both underwent significant changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it was not enough to the extent of being called a heaven-shaking change, it was something already very close to it. The benefits of the Constitution Nurturing Pill was something which every warrior had dreamt of. It was even better than an epiphany. For instance, imagine a ten-story building with an unstable base made of bricks and cement. Qing Shui’s Constitution Nurture was like building the same structure with reinforced concrete instead, ensuring that it was very stable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The changes and difference it could make were very clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took about half a day for the process of the Constitution Nurture. However, her overall strength went up significantly. The benefits weren’t just merely about going through multiple times of increase in strength. Other than providing just that, it also provided the person with even more room to improve their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another feature of the Constitution Nurture was that the younger a person had it, the better. Just like the little brat at the moment, this was how the true Constitution Nurture was supposed to be. It helped her built a good foundation. Still, Qing Shui must be particularly cautious when performing the Constitution Nurture at this time as babies’ meridians tended to be very thin. He must control his force well when performing it. It was a method which would help her gradually increase her strength as time went on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effect of the Constitution Nurturing wasn’t really that obvious yet. But following time, it would slowly become more and more significant. Just like the children he had back at home, they didn’t run into any barriers up till the Martial Emperor Grade. Furthermore, they also built an incomparably firm base. This was the benefit brought along by the Constitution Nurturing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui spent even more time helping the brat perform the Constitution Nurturing. In the middle of the process, the little brat slept soundly. Of course, this was because Qing Shui poked her Sleeping Acupoint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time he took back all his needles, Qing Shui let out a long sigh. The little brat was a Sacred Demoness to begin with and now, he even helped her perform the Constitution Nurturing as soon as she was born to unlock her potential. He couldn’t help but wonder what kind of impressive things she would achieve in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at her daughter who was already sleeping soundly before moving her sight to the man who was beside her, deep down, the Vampiric Empress felt a sense of warmth which she had never felt before. When she was young, she had once felt the warmth given by a family. Hence, she hoped that her daughter could have a complete family with a loving mother and a caring father.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, she had never actually expected things to turn out this way. Though she had taken in Qing Shui’s Blood Essence, she would have never thought that she would start a family with him. Until now, she also hadn’t held many expectations for it. The difference now, however, was that her daughter now had a father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This might be something worth being happy about. Furthermore, her father was also a very powerful figure. In the future, the little brat would grow up with someone she could rely on. She wouldn’t be bullied by others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was normal of her to think this way as a mother. It was just that by the time the brat got older, there wouldn’t actually be that many people who were actually capable of bullying her. This was something which she should never worry about. The only thing she was sure of was that her daughter would have a good father.&nbsp;</span></p>
