 <p><strong>AST 1341 - Heart Like A Clear Mirror? Physical Strength of Ten Sun, Meeting Yuan Su Once Again</strong></p>
 <p>That majestic power made Qing Shui especially worried. This was only the beginning. It was hard to tell what would happen from then on. Earlier, he saw that the few ladies had all calmly absorbed the powers and then refined them, allowing their powers to increase tremendously. This was why Qing Shui made such a bold decision. However, he hadn't expected that when it was his turn, the situation would end up being like this.</p>
 <p>He would be lying if he were to say that he wasn't worried. However, Qing Shui had encountered many situations like this and thus knew that he mustn't be distracted. He told the ladies not to disturb him no matter what happened.</p>
 <p>The ladies knew that the situation was unique and thus didn't say anything. They merely kept a distance away so that they wouldn't disturb him. In this place, there'd generally be no one who would disturb Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The moment the ladies left, Qing Shui entered straight into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The spiritual Qi there was stronger and there was still the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus and the Spring of Life. If there was a need, he could use these things to resolve his problems temporarily.</p>
 <p>His body felt as if there were burning flames which were growing increasingly bigger. He could even sense a swelling pain in his meridian channels and the golden pellet in his Dantian was also spinning rapidly. Qing Shui circulated his Focused Concentration to the maximum. Even his Qi of Heavenly Dao seemed to be stirring up.</p>
 <p>Time pass by bit and his conception vessel and governing vessel seemed as if they were swelling up so much that they were going to explode. There was the occasional pain as if he was pierced by needles. However, these weren't considered much to Qing Shui. His endurance level was still considerably powerful. At the very least, he hadn't seen anyone who had a stronger endurance than him.</p>
 <p>Pfft pfft!</p>
 <p>With two slight sounds made from the sound of his meridian channels swelling up. His skin had already cracked but his powerful recovery abilities quickly healed them.</p>
 <p>Pfft pfft!</p>
 <p>Another two soft sounds rang out. Only Qing Shui could sense that his conception vessel and governing vessel were continuing to become bigger and sturdier. The power in his body was increasing and was seething. However, as he sensed his power increasing, he didn't feel too happy. It was because he was afraid that he wouldn't have the life to enjoy the increment in his powers.</p>
 <p>Back then, it was the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet which had increased his powers tremendously. This time around, the two pellets had been furthered enhanced by crystal physiques and the effect was clearly many times stronger than before. Most importantly, this was Qing Shui's second time using it. Even when he had used it for the first time, it hadn't been as smooth-sailing as it was for the three ladies.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, Qing Shui's consciousness started to turn blurry. Or rather, he had forgotten everything but was still left with a hint of clarity. Heart like a clear mirror? Qing Shui knew what state he was in, but he enjoyed this feeling. It was as if the pain throughout his body had reduced a little as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know how long this went on for, when he seemed to have woken up and was no longer in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was standing on the beach not far away from the bamboo building. The sun was setting and Qing Shui hadn't expected himself to have stayed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for over three months.</p>
 <p>Right now, he was covered in blood and scars. The three ladies were looking at him from a distance away and when they saw him looking in their direction, they walked over with worried expressions. After all, Qing Shui looked as if he had just been soaked in blood.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!" Yehuang Guwu called out to him, worried.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan even tried to reach out her hand, wanting to hold Qing Shui. However, she hesitated. She seemed to have recalled that Qing Shui had told them not to disturb him.</p>
 <p>"I'm fine. Look at me, I'm much better than before," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan seemed to have heard what Qing Shui said and ignoring the blood on him, hugged him. She looked at him happily and the worry in her eyes seemed to have misted up a little.</p>
 <p>"Ruyan, I'm covered in filthy blood, it's dirty."</p>
 <p>"You're not dirty." Yu Ruyan just hugged Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan also looked at Qing Shui happily from the side. Although she didn't say anything, the concern in her eyes were especially strong.</p>
 <p>"I'll go wash up. I guess I can only leave tomorrow," Qing Shui said to them and with a flash, moved toward the Southern Sea.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After having cleaned up, Qing Shui laid down on the sand, wearing a happy smile. His physical strength was now slightly more than double what it was before and had reached ten sun. There were no other changes. The seven-colored pellet was still increasing his physical strength by 25 times.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immersed himself in the feeling of having his powers increased tremendously. He had never expected the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet once again gave him such a huge surprise. They had even lit up the medicinal effects left behind during the first time he took them. This time around, his power had increased greatly and he had reached a very high level amongst in the Martial Emperor realm.</p>
 <p>His physical strength, under the 25 times effect of the seven-colored pellet, ten times effect of the Big Dipper Sword, four times effect of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, double effect of the golden pellet and the double effect of the Nine-nine Divine Nebula Formation, had now reached over 45,000 sun. The attack of the Nine Continents Mountain had already exceeded 90,000 sun. The Nine Continents Mountain's attacks had the terrifying effect of the shield attack. The stronger the attack, the stronger the shield attack.</p>
 <p>His spirit energy was even more terrifying. Just a casual attack with his Seal of Roc could reach 66,000 sun and in the instances where the chances of doubling the powers were present, it would reach 130,000 sun. The 10% chance of having the power doubled was quite high. If used with the Seal of Roc, it would reach 130,000 sun even without the doubling effect. When the Seal of Roc was brought in, the power being doubled would reach a terrifying 260,000 sun.</p>
 <p>An attack with the strength of 260,000 sun was truly terrifying. Although he wouldn't be able to keep it fully under control, he could at least occasionally attack with such prowess. Furthermore, when a person had reached Qing Shui's level, the speed in a battle was very fast. Therefore, the 10% chance was considered to be quite high. And with it coming out and catching people off guard, it could easily kill the opponent.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui didn't know if the effect was so strong due to the "Heart Clear Like Mirror" state he was in. Another thing was that Qing Shui temporarily wouldn't dare to let the ladies try the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet again. Although they had gone through the first time peacefully, he decided to wait until the remnants of the medicinal effects in their bodies were about fully absorbed and their power had stabilized before he let them take the pellets a second time.</p>
 <p>At night, it was the first time that Qing Shui had shared a room together with the three ladies at once. They laid on the same bed but didn't do anything except talk. Before it was dark, Qing Shui had already pulled Yu Ruyan to have a bath in the sea with him and had taken her once. That amazing feeling was beyond words.</p>
 <p>Although they didn't have sex, there were still plenty of kissing and touching until late into the night. None of the three ladies ran off. Qing Shui almost couldn't hold himself back from eating up Yu Ruyan before the other two ladies.</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui left and the three ladies watched as he disappeared into the distance.</p>
 <p>This was the great power of the Five Elements Divine Flag. Otherwise, Qing Shui wouldn't have been able to return to the Five Continents nor would he be able to head to the Dancing Phoenix Continent.</p>
 <p>Right now, Dancing Phoenix Continent held a different meaning to Qing Shui. It was now where he was based in when he was in the other three continents. Furthermore, he would soon be able to establish a firm stand. Those with a strength of 300,000 to 500,000 sun would be considered Peak Martial Emperor. He could now be considered to be a Peak Martial Emperor, albeit barely so.</p>
 <p>Those with a strength of 300,000 sun would only be left with 240,000 sun after being weakened by him. Those with a strength of 500,000 sun would also be weakened by 100,000 sun. This was by the Emperor's Qi. He didn't know if the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's Vajra Subdues Demons would still be effective. Therefore, Qing Shui didn't take it into consideration.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was headed toward the Imperial Cuisine Hall. As he walked, he thought about his future path. There were some False Gods in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. After all, there were 81 countries. Yehuang Country's Yehuang Clan had one and even other clans might also have one or several False Gods. Therefore, there were definitely False God experts in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. It was just that with the huge population, the number of False Gods could only be considered to be the tip of the iceberg.</p>
 <p>Right now, he was strong enough to fight against ordinary Peak Martial Emperors. There should be quite a number of Peak Martial Emperors in the Yehuang City.</p>
 <p>He soon arrived at the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Although he hadn't seen it for some time, it was still as prosperous as before or even more so than before. When he came back the last time, it was the birthday of Yehuang Clan's Old Master. It had caused Imperial Cuisine Hall's reputation spread, making it the best place in the city. Therefore, for the past few days, the "guests" in the Imperial Cuisine Hall had increased by a lot. And they were of considerable statuses.</p>
 <p>The moment he entered the fifth story, Soulsearch greeted Qing Shui in surprise, "Brother, you're back."</p>
 <p>Soulsearch was now in high spirits. Not only had he gotten married, his wife had also gotten pregnant. Moreover, his medical skills had also improved several fold. All these, including the changes that had occurred to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, he was now happier than anyone else. All these were thanks to Qing Shui. Otherwise, he would have to forever be considered a top notch physician amongst second-rate physicians.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he didn't have any kin. Therefore, he treated Qing Shui as if he was his closest kin. Everything he had was given to him by Qing Shui and therefore, he was willing to give Qing Shui anything.</p>
 <p>"Has everything been fine for the past few days?" Qing Shui asked casually.</p>
 <p>"Everything's fine but quite a number of people wish to meet you. I've rejected them all. Many people wanted you to treat their illnesses but I've rejected them as well. Oh right, another physician has come. Her medical skills aren't bad and she's even a great beauty. I'm just waiting for you to come back and make the decision," Soulsearch smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Oh? Then call her in and I'll take a look. If it's fine, then we'll just decide on that. One's medical skills can improve but it's hard to change one's character. Therefore, one's character is more important," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, that's right!"</p>
 <p>Very quickly, footstep sounds could be heard outside the fifth story. A lady walked in. When Qing Shui saw this lady, he was stunned. It was because he knew her. To think that it was her...</p>
 <p>Yuan Su!</p>
 <p>She lifted up her head slowly. Qing Shui was as astonished as he was when he first met her. She was as beautiful as before but what that had taken him by surprise wasn't her beauty, but her expression. It was an extremely calm expression, one that would make people who saw her feel very calm and peaceful. No matter how agitated one was, they would feel at ease.</p>
 <p>This was an inborn aura she exuded!</p>
 <p>Her beautiful brows were like crescent moons, her pair of bright eyes like black treasured stones. Her upright nose was like white jade, making her seem to be a person who knew what she wanted. When she saw Qing Shui, her small red lips opened slightly, revealing her snow-white beautiful teeth. Her surprised expression seemed to show that she was in disbelief.</p>
 <p>She must not have expected that she would be able to meet Qing Shui here. When she saw Qing Shui, her beautiful figure trembled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was as much surprised. Back in the Central Continent, she was the Medicine Sect's pilar, an amazing lady who could create alchemy recipes. She originally had a Stone Body and couldn't cultivate but Qing Shui had cured her of that condition. It was a pity that they had parted on a sour note.</p>
 <p>It had been many years since they had met. There weren't many changes to her appearance and she was still very beautiful. However, Qing Shui didn't know why she would appear in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. This was a place that was separated by the Western Oxhe Continent. However, he thought of how her physique might have been discovered by some great masters who were traveling around the nine continents. Or, it could also be that she had come to this place due to some incidents!</p>
