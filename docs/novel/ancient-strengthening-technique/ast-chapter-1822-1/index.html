 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't too worried. With Shen Huang around, especially now that there had been a change in her perception, Qing Shui was not concerned. However, he would still remain here for a while and won't be leaving right away. Before he left, he might as well resolve all the matters here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, the Qing Clan didn't take part in the fight. Qing Shui actually hoped that they would never have to get involved. However, just in case something were to happen, it was necessary for them to have the power to back themselves up. Sometimes, things would not go as well and one did not have the choice of participating or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui put aside the alchemy work he was doing, feeling a little agitated. The alchemy recipe for the Reborn Pellet was going to come out very soon. He would be able to accumulate sufficient experience in the period of time he had in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been very long. The increment to his alchemy experience was slower than a snail. Still, it continued to increase a little bit at a time. Therefore, over the years, Qing Shui had always spent some time accumulating experience in alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, the increase in his experience got faster and Qing Shui saw some hope. Compared to the slow increment from before, it was now rapid. Earlier on, the increment had been a few points each time, despite that the requirement was for over ten million points. At a later time, the increment was over 100 points each time and if he was lucky, it'd be a few hundred points. This was when the time spent on each alchemy process was considered to be very long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, any alchemy he did would gain him some experience worth of a few hundred points. However, right now, he would only get a couple of hundred when he was lucky. Just this low couple of hundreds would make Qing Shui extremely happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too boring to be performing alchemy solely to accumulate experience. Moreover, there was only a little experience with each time. Without powerful determination, one wouldn't be able to persist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Considering the amount of effort taken to reach this, it should be a very powerful medicine. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to do any justice to the hard work during the past years. Although it had only been several years, to Qing Shui, it was the equivalent of several hundreds of years. If the alchemy recipe that took him several hundreds of years worthless, Qing Shui would probably end up spurting blood from shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After having some rest and taking a meal, Qing Shui once again continued performing alchemy. The Golden Flint Iron Cauldron was an item which he had gotten his hands on when he met Huoyun Liu-Li in the past, and was given to him by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever Qing Shui looked at this Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, a special feeling would arise in his heart. He would think of the things that had happened between himself and Huoyun Liu-Li, especially the times when they had just gotten to know each other as well as the things that had happened during the time spent at the Earthly Paradise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was only a little bit of experience away, even with the minor increment increase after spending a large part of the day. Time was ticking by and the closer he got to the goal, the more anxious he felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a long while since Qing Shui got this agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The familiar pleasant sound rang out and Qing Shui felt that it was better than the most melodious music in the world. He had been waiting for this sound all this time but it had refused to appear. Thereafter, he gave up on waiting for it and just focused on performing alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing the sound, Qing Shui forgot about his fatigue and immediately returned to life before taking a look at the Reborn Pellet's alchemy recipe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reborn Pellet: Sacred Luo Fruit, Spring of Life, Stone Goblet Milk with an age of 10,000 Years or more, Ice-Immortal Snow Lotus, turtle blood with an age of 100,000 years or more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Effect: Allow flesh to grow from bones. Can reverse one's damage if damage did not exceed 20% of one's body. Can allow all the minor damages in a complete body that was less than 30% to be completely healed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was extremely astonished. As expected of the Reborn Pellet, it was really logic-defying. It could really bring one back to life. Qing Shui had yet to see a miraculous medicine that could bring the dead back to life and allow flesh to grow again on bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was definitely considered to be a miraculous medicine. As long as a person didn't lose their head, if they were to lose an arm, it was possible for the arm to be regenerated. However, it would be difficult if one were to lose an entire leg. Even if someone were to lose two of their internal organs, this medicine would allow them to be healed rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui got back to his senses after submerging in the blissful feeling. He had been so happy that it was as if he had already created this miraculous medicine. However, it was only an alchemy recipe. A recipe that listed the ingredients required to refine a miraculous medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one were to fail at creating it, then they could only have themselves to blame for being useless. Qing Shui didn't doubt his abilities in alchemy but the ingredients listed made him felt a little troubled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The things which existed in the legends could be found in this world. Take the legendary grade weapons for example. It was just that these things were especially few and it would be even more difficult to find one particular legendary item. If it was just a legendary grade item of any kind, it would be easy for Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised at the requirement of the Spring of Life. If he didn't happen to possess it, where could he go and look for one?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also had the required Stone Goblet Milk with an age of over 10,000 Years as well. Back then, he got intimate with Yu Ruyan in the area and had stored quite a lot of the Stone Goblet Milk in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. As for Turtle blood with an age of 100,000 Years or more, it was a little difficult. However, he can look for it after returning to the North Sea. The Golden Medicinal Turtle was still a little short of the age and if there were really no other way, he could just wait for the Golden Medicinal Turtle to reach the required age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another thing was the Ice-Immortal Snow Lotus. Qing Shui hadn't heard of this before. However, he had heard of the Ice-Mountain Snow Lotus. Their names were almost the same, but they were completely different. Qing Shui specifically took a close look at it. It really said Ice-Immortal Snow Lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the other items, they were mostly precious medicinal herbs or the like. However, Qing Shui had a lot of stock in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Right now, the two things that he needed to find were the Sacred Luo Fruit and the Ice-Immortal Snow Lotus. Turtle blood with an age of 100,000 Years or more didn't seem to be that hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he had obtained the recipe, Qing Shui didn't feel like performing alchemy to accumulate experience anymore. However, it was a pity that he won't be able to refine the Reborn Pellet in the short term. He decided to wash up and take a look around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to take a look at the various treasures, many of which he had almost forgotten about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pure Gold Fishing Rod!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't used this for very long. In the past, he had fished out a Portrait of Beauty in addition to many other treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Longevity Fish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there were already many Longevity Fish in the lake in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also the Rainbow Trout Fish and others. All these were very delicious but there was no end to them no matter how much he ate. Moreover, they no longer brought him any other effects. He had eaten too much. Furthermore, he didn't care for the other effects they could bring neither. Even the younger kids in the Qing Clan wouldn't care for them.</span></p>

Things like this were actually dependant on one's aptitude and talent. Everyone had a different physical aptitude. In his previous life, it was said children could only start walking at 18 months old. However, there were also those who could start walking at 10 months old. Most could already start walking around 13 months old.</span></p>

Sometimes, just a tiny bit of difference could bring about overwhelming changes.</span></p>

For those who did not cultivate or were at a very young age, the difference wasn’t big. However, in the future, if one were to start cultivating, the difference could be the difference between the sky and the ground.</span></p>
