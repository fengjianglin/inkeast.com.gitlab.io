  <p><strong>AST 0131 – Recipe for the Five Dragon Pellet</strong></p>
  <p>“Sigh… they all said that my daughter was born innately weak, and doesn’t have much time left, and that there was nothing they could do.” The young married lady sighed. It seemed as though she had expected the same result. The only reason she came running over was to fight for a last chance for her daughter!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was not surprised. This little girl’s situation was similar to his own when he was younger, but worse. Qing Shui took another look at this young girl. She was exquisite and flawless as if a piece of nicely carved jade, and would make anyone take a liking to her. It was just that her eyes were tightly shut, and her pale face was scrunched in pain. </p>
  <p>“I can cure her, but the child is still too young. I can only give her a slight treatment daily, and persist in doing so for a very long time. You’ll need to come by daily.”</p>
  <p>As he said this, Qing Shui concurrently applied the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to soothe the girl’s meridian and blood channels on her head to change the state of her inborn weak constitution. It was too bad that the child was too young, and he could only soothe it ever so slightly.</p>
  <p>“Really, you really can cure her? You’re telling the truth?” The lady said in surprise. It could be that she was too surprised that she unknowingly grabbed onto Qing Shui’s hand, and asked him in a panic.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui nodded his head in affirmation!</p>
  <p>The beautiful young married lady then realized that he was still grabbing onto Qing Shui’s hand and quickly let go. A patch of red dyed her makeup-free face, bringing out some alluring charm to her purity.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carried the little girl, while his hand seemed to be slowly caressing the girl on her back. The exquisite little face started to become rosier, and her pair of eyes with long lashes also slowly opened.</p>
  <p>The crystal-like big eyes, coupled with the exquisite small face made her look like a doll. Her big eyes looked towards Qing Shui as they blinked. It was extremely cute!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled gently at the pretty little girl. He enjoyed carrying her in his arms. One would have to admit that this little girl was extremely likeable. Just that cute appearance alone would be able to conquer a whole group. Those who saw her would probably want to carry or tease her.</p>
  <p>“The two of us really have an affinity!” Qing Shui said softly as he looked at the little girl.</p>
  <p>“Alright, this will be fine for today. In the future, make a trip here daily. It would at most take half a year, and then she’ll be completely cured!” Qing Shui returned the girl to the lady.</p>
  <p>The lady had initially not held any expectations. She had went to almost all of the clinics in the vicinity, but the reply she received was that only a Xiantian alchemist may be able to help her daughter. However, given that her daughter didn’t have much more time to wait, even if she was able to find a Xiantian alchemist, she may not necessarily be saved.</p>
  <p>Under a state of desperation, she started to carry her daughter everywhere to look for clinics, hoping for a miracle. She started early in the morning before many clinics had opened, knocking on door after door, but the only reply given was either that it was beyond them, or that the doors remained closed. </p>
  <p>Seeing her daughter’s vitality getting weaker and weaker, it was as if her own heart had sunk to the bottom of the valley. Despair, hopelessness, and grief tormented her. The grief was as if a knife was twisting in her heart, and she had a feeling which was worse than death itself.</p>
  <p>She chanced upon the Martial Clinic which had just opened, and without a second thought, she entered, feeling numb from all the previous disappointments.</p>
  <p>“Doctor, how… how much does it cost?” The lady received her child and asked, feeling unsettled.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could tell that she had problems, and smiled at her, saying, “I seem to have an affinity with this young girl, so you can forget about paying me! I also hope to see her remain healthy and happy!”</p>
  <p>“How can that do? Doctor, just tell me the fee and I will pay, I will definitely pay.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was touched when he saw the way she was acting, and he felt for her. “Then can you tell me how much money do you have now?”</p>
  <p>“I have spent all my money over the past year, and even sold my house. But the happiest thing is for my daughter to be able to recover. I will try my best to find a job soon to earn money. Doctor, you can rest assured. You are my benefactor, so no matter what happens, I won’t delay the payment of your consultation fees.” The beautiful young married lady smiled gently as she spoke sincerely. Anyone would believe in that determined tone that no matter how tough or how tired she was, she would make sure to pay the money.</p>
  <p>“You are a lady bringing your daughter and running about. Where’s your husband?” Qing Shui could not think of who would be able to bear to let such a beautiful lady like her go through so much toil and trouble.</p>
  <p>“Him? Hah, he left me for a lady with power!” She laughed self-mockingly, and her gaze grew distant, as if she was thinking back on her memories.</p>
  <p>“I’m sorry, I made you recall terrible memories.” Qing Shui smiled awkwardly.</p>
  <p>“It’s nothing. I had forgotten about the existence of such a person until you brought it up. Thank you doctor, I will remember you!” After saying this, the lady turned and wanted to leave.</p>
  <p>“You are penniless right now, and would be easily tricked by others if you were to head out with a young daughter to look for a job in such a state. Moreover, your daughter is still young. Do you have time to work?” Qing Shui said in a comforting tone.</p>
  <p>The lady remained silent. To be honest, she was already on the lookout for a job. Those who were recruiting helpers immediately rejected her upon seeing that she had a child who could not leave her side. Those who had evil designs to recruit her were all rejected by her.</p>
  <p>“If you don’t mind, you can follow me to the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. When you have time, you can help out with some simple chores. You can eat and stay there as well. This way, you will have a place to stay, and it will also be easy for me to treat the little girl. Half a year later, if you wish to leave, I will give you a sum of housing allowance. If you wish to stay, that would be fine as well. What do you think?”</p>
  <p>In the end, she agreed. She would remember forever Qing Shui’s kindness to her. If there was a chance, she would do her best to pay him back for his kindness.</p>
  <p>Seeing that it was noon soon, “Sister Mingyue, come, let’s go together. I’ll help you carry Yuchang!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui now knows that the beautiful young married lady was called Mingyue Gelou. It was a name which intrigued him, but he did not dare to ask. The little girl’s name was Mingyue Yuchang!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui helped Mingyue Gelou carry Yuchang towards the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store which was not far away.</p>
  <p>It was very heartwarming for her to see her daughter in the arms of the man called Qing Shui. She didn’t cry or make a fuss, and instead would touch Qing Shui’s ears and nose cutely while Qing Shui would pretend to be a wild beast and scare her, causing her to laugh non-stop. At the same time, she also felt slightly bitter. A family without a man was not a proper family, and a child who did not have the love of a father was very pitiful!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt very happy as he walked alongside Mingyue Gelou. Every now and then, they would tease Yuchang, and were very much like a happy family of three.</p>
  <p>At first, Mingyue Gelou was still a bit concerned. But after entering Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store and seeing the welcoming members of the Qing Clan, she was assured and was very willing to stay there.</p>
  <p>Qing Yi happily took over Yuchang from Qing Shui. The love reflected from her eyes astonished Mingyue Gelou. Qing Shui knew that his mother must have thought of her own pitiful daughter. That sister of his was probably about the same age when she was taken away.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, they prepared a feast to welcome Mingyue Gelou and the little girl. Qing Yi even specially prepared some black fish soup for the little girl. The rest had to make do with drinking the turtle soup.</p>
  <p>“Haha, the recipe for the Five Dragon Pellet is finally out!”</p>
  <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui stared at the recipe for the Five Dragon Pellet happily. After a while, he turned gloomy upon seeing that it had a higher difficulty than the recipe for the Small Revitalizing Pellet. Other than requiring a Thousand Year Snow Lotus, it still required some Thousand Year Deer Antlers, and a herb that grew on demonic beasts. But Qing Shui was thankful that it was deer antlers, since he should be able to get some from Baili Jingwei.</p>
  <p>The other ingredients could be purchased, making Qing Shui feel that those which could be bought with money were not worth anything. Thinking about that alone made him feel absurd. To think that even though he did not have any money, he was already having thoughts that those which could be purchased were not the best…</p>
  <p>The effects of the Five Dragon Pellet included neutralizing all negative effects immediately, completely removing the effects of poison, mental attacks, hallucinations from medicine! With the exception of internal injuries and fatal injuries, it could heal external injuries in a short amount of time, and slightly improve the physical condition of the person. So long as it was not a case of instant death when receiving heavy injuries, by consuming the Five Dragon Pellet, one could hang on for another 24 hours!</p>
  <p>“Powerful, perverse. Merely the ability to completely remove all negative effects is good enough, but it could also heal external injuries in a short amount of time. Furthermore, if it was not an injury resulting in instant death, then one could hang on for an additional 24 hours, which is a day. Within a day, many things can happen. ”</p>
  <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique had already broken through to the level of circulating 55 cycles, and he had made small improvements in his abilities. Qing Shui was the happiest when he saw an improvement in his abilities, albeit if it was just a little. So long as there was constant increase and improvement, there would be hope.</p>
  <p>The next medicinal pill on the list was Great Revitalizing Pellet, but the required experience was 100 thousand. Qing Shui knew that it was impossible to reach it within a short span of time, but he was still curious about its effects since it required such an absurd amount of experience.</p>
  <p>During that period of time, he continued calmly but successively. It was just that there was one more item added to his to-do-list. While Yuchang could not yet to speak clearly, she liked to cling to him, getting him to carry her whenever he was free. This made everyone in the Qing Clan, and even Mingyue Gelou, very surprised.</p>
  <p>Because of this, Qing Shui was often teased by the rest. Qing You even suggested that Qing Shui take the little girl as his daughter, causing everyone to break into laughter.</p>
  <p>But Qing Shui did not find it funny. That was because the little girl really started to call Qing Shui daddy under the instigation of Qing You.</p>
  <p>The first time, Qing Shui almost fainted. But as time passed, the number of times the little girl called him that increased, and to Qing Shui it no longer felt weird. She had called him “daddy” so many times that he was used to it.</p>
  <p>The days passed by, and the reputation of the Martial Clinic spread further and further. There were even people from other cities who came to seek his consultation.</p>
  <p>“You are the doctor of the Martial Clinic?” A voice filled with disdain pulled Qing Shui back to his senses.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could not help but frown as he looked towards the lavishly dressed youth when he heard the voice. He hated that tone. It was as if the person himself was the most awesome person across the world of the nine continents!</p>
  <p>“Mmm, I am. What ails you?” Although Qing Shui set up a clinic, it was not for the sake of money. Therefore, if they were not people who were sincere in seeking his consultation, he would not give a hoot.</p>
  <p>“It’s not me. Come with us. Our young master wants to meet you.” After saying that, the youth simply walked out.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui remained indifferent as he shook his head and continued to stare into space. He did not like such servants who did not hold others in regards. These people were simply abominable.</p>
  <p>The youth walked out, but saw that there was no motion behind him. He was enraged that a doctor from a small clinic would dare to be so arrogant.</p>
  <p>“Did you hear what I…”</p>
  <p>“Scram!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui interrupted the other party’s sentence without even raising his head. This made the youth look at him, stunned. He had even forgotten what anger was.</p>
  <p>“You rascal, do you know who I am?” The youth clenched his teeth, and looked at Qing Shui viciously.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled as he looked at the resentful youth, and simply said, “Merely a dog!”</p>

 <p>“How can that do? Doctor, just tell me the fee and I will pay, I will definitely pay.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was touched when he saw the way she was acting, and he felt for her. “Then can you tell me how much money do you have now?”</p>
 <p>“I have spent all my money over the past year, and even sold my house. But the happiest thing is for my daughter to be able to recover. I will try my best to find a job soon to earn money. Doctor, you can rest assured. You are my benefactor, so no matter what happens, I won’t delay the payment of your consultation fees.” The beautiful young married lady smiled gently as she spoke sincerely. Anyone would believe in that determined tone that no matter how tough or how tired she was, she would make sure to pay the money.</p>
 <p>“You are a lady bringing your daughter and running about. Where’s your husband?” Qing Shui could not think of who would be able to bear to let such a beautiful lady like her go through so much toil and trouble.</p>
 <p>“Him? Hah, he left me for a lady with power!” She laughed self-mockingly, and her gaze grew distant, as if she was thinking back on her memories.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, I made you recall terrible memories.” Qing Shui smiled awkwardly.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing. I had forgotten about the existence of such a person until you brought it up. Thank you doctor, I will remember you!” After saying this, the lady turned and wanted to leave.</p>
 <p>“You are penniless right now, and would be easily tricked by others if you were to head out with a young daughter to look for a job in such a state. Moreover, your daughter is still young. Do you have time to work?” Qing Shui said in a comforting tone.</p>
 <p>The lady remained silent. To be honest, she was already on the lookout for a job. Those who were recruiting helpers immediately rejected her upon seeing that she had a child who could not leave her side. Those who had evil designs to recruit her were all rejected by her.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t mind, you can follow me to the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. When you have time, you can help out with some simple chores. You can eat and stay there as well. This way, you will have a place to stay, and it will also be easy for me to treat the little girl. Half a year later, if you wish to leave, I will give you a sum of housing allowance. If you wish to stay, that would be fine as well. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>In the end, she agreed. She would remember forever Qing Shui’s kindness to her. If there was a chance, she would do her best to pay him back for his kindness.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was noon soon, “Sister Mingyue, come, let’s go together. I’ll help you carry Yuchang!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now knows that the beautiful young married lady was called Mingyue Gelou. It was a name which intrigued him, but he did not dare to ask. The little girl’s name was Mingyue Yuchang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui helped Mingyue Gelou carry Yuchang towards the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store which was not far away.</p>
 <p>It was very heartwarming for her to see her daughter in the arms of the man called Qing Shui. She didn’t cry or make a fuss, and instead would touch Qing Shui’s ears and nose cutely while Qing Shui would pretend to be a wild beast and scare her, causing her to laugh non-stop. At the same time, she also felt slightly bitter. A family without a man was not a proper family, and a child who did not have the love of a father was very pitiful!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very happy as he walked alongside Mingyue Gelou. Every now and then, they would tease Yuchang, and were very much like a happy family of three.</p>
 <p>At first, Mingyue Gelou was still a bit concerned. But after entering Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store and seeing the welcoming members of the Qing Clan, she was assured and was very willing to stay there.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi happily took over Yuchang from Qing Shui. The love reflected from her eyes astonished Mingyue Gelou. Qing Shui knew that his mother must have thought of her own pitiful daughter. That sister of his was probably about the same age when she was taken away.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, they prepared a feast to welcome Mingyue Gelou and the little girl. Qing Yi even specially prepared some black fish soup for the little girl. The rest had to make do with drinking the turtle soup.</p>
 <p>“Haha, the recipe for the Five Dragon Pellet is finally out!”</p>
 <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui stared at the recipe for the Five Dragon Pellet happily. After a while, he turned gloomy upon seeing that it had a higher difficulty than the recipe for the Small Revitalizing Pellet. Other than requiring a Thousand Year Snow Lotus, it still required some Thousand Year Deer Antlers, and a herb that grew on demonic beasts. But Qing Shui was thankful that it was deer antlers, since he should be able to get some from Baili Jingwei.</p>
 <p>The other ingredients could be purchased, making Qing Shui feel that those which could be bought with money were not worth anything. Thinking about that alone made him feel absurd. To think that even though he did not have any money, he was already having thoughts that those which could be purchased were not the best…</p>
 <p>The effects of the Five Dragon Pellet included neutralizing all negative effects immediately, completely removing the effects of poison, mental attacks, hallucinations from medicine! With the exception of internal injuries and fatal injuries, it could heal external injuries in a short amount of time, and slightly improve the physical condition of the person. So long as it was not a case of instant death when receiving heavy injuries, by consuming the Five Dragon Pellet, one could hang on for another 24 hours!</p>
 <p>“Powerful, perverse. Merely the ability to completely remove all negative effects is good enough, but it could also heal external injuries in a short amount of time. Furthermore, if it was not an injury resulting in instant death, then one could hang on for an additional 24 hours, which is a day. Within a day, many things can happen. ”</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique had already broken through to the level of circulating 55 cycles, and he had made small improvements in his abilities. Qing Shui was the happiest when he saw an improvement in his abilities, albeit if it was just a little. So long as there was constant increase and improvement, there would be hope.</p>
 <p>The next medicinal pill on the list was Great Revitalizing Pellet, but the required experience was 100 thousand. Qing Shui knew that it was impossible to reach it within a short span of time, but he was still curious about its effects since it required such an absurd amount of experience.</p>
 <p>During that period of time, he continued calmly but successively. It was just that there was one more item added to his to-do-list. While Yuchang could not yet to speak clearly, she liked to cling to him, getting him to carry her whenever he was free. This made everyone in the Qing Clan, and even Mingyue Gelou, very surprised.</p>
 <p>Because of this, Qing Shui was often teased by the rest. Qing You even suggested that Qing Shui take the little girl as his daughter, causing everyone to break into laughter.</p>
 <p>But Qing Shui did not find it funny. That was because the little girl really started to call Qing Shui daddy under the instigation of Qing You.</p>
 <p>The first time, Qing Shui almost fainted. But as time passed, the number of times the little girl called him that increased, and to Qing Shui it no longer felt weird. She had called him “daddy” so many times that he was used to it.</p>
 <p>The days passed by, and the reputation of the Martial Clinic spread further and further. There were even people from other cities who came to seek his consultation.</p>
 <p>“You are the doctor of the Martial Clinic?” A voice filled with disdain pulled Qing Shui back to his senses.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not help but frown as he looked towards the lavishly dressed youth when he heard the voice. He hated that tone. It was as if the person himself was the most awesome person across the world of the nine continents!</p>
 <p>“Mmm, I am. What ails you?” Although Qing Shui set up a clinic, it was not for the sake of money. Therefore, if they were not people who were sincere in seeking his consultation, he would not give a hoot.</p>
 <p>“It’s not me. Come with us. Our young master wants to meet you.” After saying that, the youth simply walked out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained indifferent as he shook his head and continued to stare into space. He did not like such servants who did not hold others in regards. These people were simply abominable.</p>
 <p>The youth walked out, but saw that there was no motion behind him. He was enraged that a doctor from a small clinic would dare to be so arrogant.</p>
 <p>“Did you hear what I…”</p>
 <p>“Scram!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui interrupted the other party’s sentence without even raising his head. This made the youth look at him, stunned. He had even forgotten what anger was.</p>
 <p>“You rascal, do you know who I am?” The youth clenched his teeth, and looked at Qing Shui viciously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he looked at the resentful youth, and simply said, “Merely a dog!”</p>
