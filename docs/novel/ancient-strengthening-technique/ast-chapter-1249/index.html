 <p><strong>AST 1249 - Finally Refined, Formidable Strength, Powerful Controlling Ability</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really surprised as he felt the changes that took place in his body. This kind of situation would be beneficial for him in absorbing that powerful energy.</p>
 <p>However, it didn’t take long until he realized that the changes within his body began to slow down and was already coming to a stop. It had already helped him to increase his strength a little. This made him really excited because he could now consume ten One-Yang Pill and Two-Yang Pill respectively.</p>
 <p>It was just that, he could only take one pill per year. However in his case, he only needed to wait for three days or a bit more until he could take another one. He wasn’t really interested now to the force that the One-Yang Pill or Two-Yang Pill could increase, but rather, to the increase in the amount of strength which his body could contain.</p>
 <p>This, in a way, was also considered to be raising his body’s hidden potential.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Nine Yang Gold Needle!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he only let other people experienced this and had never tried it for himself before. However, he was the one who needed it the most at the moment. As Qing Shui thought about this, he immediately started activate it. It was fairly easy for him to inject the needles into himself.</p>
 <p>He could also control the process of injecting needles with his spirit energy right away.Throughout this process, Qing Shui found himself in a state of incomparable surprise. The acupuncture had actually managed to increase his strength even more significantly than what the One-Yang Pill and Two-Yang Pill had brought.</p>
 <p>While he sensed the changes that took place within his body, Qing Shui began to feel that he could refine the energy now. However, for safety purposes, he still decided to wait for one more month to refine it after he finished consuming the One-Yang Pills and Two-Yang Pills.</p>
 <p>By the time when slightly more than a month had passed, Qing Shui believed that his position within the Heaven Secrets Academy would be even more stable. The headmaster might be able to see his hidden potential. Even though it wasn’t to the extent that he would break through right away to become invincible, he would definitely become a lot more powerful than before at this time..</p>
 <p>By then, he would be able to finally leave. The Heaven Secrets Academy would also help look after the Breezing Wind Veranda and his friends.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who already had a plan, felt his whole being becoming even more relaxed. During this time, he planned to help the Eldest Princess and the others. At the moment, the Eldest Princess’ strength could already be considered to be quite decent. He had already helped her unlocked quite a lot of her hidden potential this time. For someone at her age, she was definitely considered as an absolute genius. He believed that the old men from the Heaven Secrets Academy would not make things difficult for her.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Just like this, other than guiding them through their cultivation, Qing Shui would also walk around the areas near the Heaven Secrets Academy. He remembered the things which the old man had mentioned before, about the strongest force within the Western Oxhe Continent being around 8,000 sun. Then, it was very likely that the Heaven Secrets Academy already had the same strength, or maybe even more.</p>
 <p>Considering that the Heaven Secrets Academy was able to stand at the same grade as the two dynasties in terms of strength, this just meant that their strength was almost equal to the others. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have lived in balance with each other. Qing Shui was aware that anyone would want to rule a continent, it was just that no one actually had the strength to do so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very far away from the 8,000 sun of strength every time he thought about it. Could 8,000 sun of strength be considered as a False God?</p>
 <p>The False God realm was equivalent to being a god across the land. The power it possessed was incomparably frightening, and seemed like it wouldn’t be so easy to break through to it. It was still unknown whether the Western Oxhe Continent had cultivators at the False God Realm.</p>
 <p>The lands within a thousand Li of the Heaven Secrets Academy were all it’s territory. The mountains nearby had different heights and extended over a thousand miles. In the morning, whenever QIng Shui was free, he would stroll around nearby to look at the scenery.</p>
 <p>There were lakes, a small sea, rivers, forests, as well as mountains nearby. The land was filled with many things. A bit further away from here, there was a path that lead to the Desolate Mountain Regions. Deep within that area was actually very risky. There were even rumors that said that once a person passed through it, he or she would be able to arrive at the other five continents. There were also sayings that this place was connected to the other three continents.</p>
 <p>There were also specific ways to travel to the Soaring Dragon Continent, Dancing Phoenix Continent, as well as the Haohan Continent. To do so, he would need to pass through extreme lands. The Western Oxhe Continent was actually an intersection point between the five continents and the other three continents. This was also why back then, he could only arrive at the Western Oxhe Continent through the Ancient Great Formation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that if he had the chance, he would definitely ask how he could head to the other three continents.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, almost a month had passed. Within this one month, Qing Shui and the others hardly interacted with the outside world. They all cultivated ardously and all of them made decent progress.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt somewhat excited. This was because he felt that the time was right for him to refine the powerful energy. Once he refine it, he would earn a huge asset for himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already helped Yan Jinyu, the Seventh Princess, as well as Qing Sha with acupunctures. However, he controlled the needles through the air with his Spiritual Energy. He didn’t touch any of them from the beginning until the end. This made the Eldest Princess, who was also present, to keep staring at him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel the Eldest Princess’ stare and he could only smile in response: “This is something which I just improved. I wasn’t able to do it before.”</p>
 <p>Naturally, the Eldest Princess didn’t believe him.</p>
 <p>Even the Eldest Princess herself was shocked with the changes that took place in herself at the moment. She noticed that she didn’t feel repelled to this little man at all. So much that she wouldn’t even feel angry if he took some advantage from her. She didn’t know what kind of feeling she had towards him. Could it be considered as a close buddy?</p>
 <p>After Qing Sha and the girls left, Qing Shui held the Eldest Princess’ hands and went for a walk together. This was the changes which took place throughout this month. Now, Qing Shui could hold the hand of a beautiful woman as he wished, as well as walked and talked with her inside the courtyard.</p>
 <p>To be specific, Qing Shui himself also didn’t know since when it started. Furthermore, the Eldest Princess didn’t seem to repel against it as well. Slowly, it seemed like they had even gotten used to it. Other than this, they would at most hug each other, which rarely happened. They don’t have any interactions even closer than these.</p>
 <p>“You have been letting everyone cultivate really hard lately. Is anything wrong? Are you about to leave?” the Eldest Princess strolled around slowly while holding his hands. She looked to the side and asked him.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I should be leaving soon. I will know the answer within these two or three days. Now, your strength is improving steadily. Can you help guide them as well?” Qing Shui asked after he thought for awhile.</p>
 <p>“I will. Are you going to Divine Might Dynasty?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Qing Shui responded. He didn’t say anything more.</p>
 <p>“I wish all the best for you. Once your wife comes back, we can’t stay like this anymore.” The Eldest Princess smiled while she raised both of their hands that were holding each other.</p>
 <p>“As long as you don’t get married, this is still fine……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui treated her like his bosom buddy, his own soulmate. It's just that he didn't know how long it could last.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He felt excited at the moment as he could finally refine the energy which the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant paid back to him. The vacant feeling within his body had already expanded almost half its original size.</p>
 <p>Additionally, the toughness of his meridians had also increased. Qing Shui felt that he had made enough preparation and couldn't wait to refine it. This way, he felt that he would have his own assets to do things which he wanted.</p>
 <p>He adjusted his strength to its peak state and revolved the strength within his body. He waited until he calmed down to immediately circulate his strength and pierce through the grey energy pill.</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s forehead, the top of his head, as well as his chest were all injected with three Gold Needles. A formidable force gushed in and it almost made Qing Shui faint. Waves after waves of fresh aura started exuding from the top of his head, his chest, as well as his forehead to keep his mind awake and ensure his blood flowed smoothly. The Yin-Yang Image also revolved at a never-before-seen fast speed.</p>
 <p>The energy raged through his entire body. The Seven Colored Pellet was also revolving very quickly, as it constantly absorbed the energy. Simultaneously, the Golden Pellet was also constantly enriching itself.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain within his Dantian was also absorbing the energy. It seemed to have an even deeper connection with Qing Shui now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body once again experienced another cleansing, and once again experienced another rebirth. However, it was a lot safer compared to last time. At least, Qing Shui felt that he could control it.</p>
 <p>It was still dangerous like before, but Qing Shui’s meridians and tendons had improved significantly, added on that it was just too much powerful than before.</p>
 <p>However this time, it seemed like the energy he was absorbing was also much more in quantity. It was just that it felt less difficult than before, as after all, his strength back then was too weak. It was just too dangerous for him to try and take in so much energy forcefully.</p>
 <p>Even thinking about it now made him felt really terrified. If it wasn't for his Force of Rebirth, there wouldn't be anything that he could do.</p>
 <p>Everyone was born a gambler and Qing Shui was cleary one. Just like now, what he was doing was already a bit like gambling.</p>
 <p>Time flowed by and Qing Shui didn’t know how long it has been. At first, the entire process was filled with extreme danger, but as things progressed, he began to slowly take hold of the energy until he managed to calm it down eventually. Now, it could be already considered that he had completely refined it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a long sigh and slowly opened both of his eyes. He had a neutral expression and looked really calm, just like a normal person. However, he also possessed a kind of momentum unable to be described in words.</p>
 <p>He had completely transformed. Now, a calmness and confidence flowed from him. However, it also wouldn't give people the impression that he lacked sharpness.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a bit of pain as he looked at the blood clots which condensed from the blood throughout his body. This was all his own blood, but when he remembered that these were all the filthy and extra substances within the blood in his body, and that leaving it inside would only bring disadvantages for him, he felt more at ease.</p>
 <p>After he took a shower, Qing Shui then changed into a new cloth and conveniently destroyed the clothes stained in blood. After only doing these did he quickly went on to sense the changes within his body.</p>
 <p>Raw strength was worth one sun…..</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui could feel the dramatic increase of his strength within his body, at the moment when he tried to sense the total amount of increase in his strength, he was still got shocked by it. One sun was equivalent to 10,000 nimbus. Prior to this, he was only someone with a strength worth around 3,000 nimbus.</p>
 <p>What concept was this? His strength actually increased by around 6,000+ nimbus.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui sensed the Seven-Colored Pellet, he got stunned once again. It went up from the original 15 folds increase in raw strength to 20 folds increase in raw strength…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel the changes currently taking place within his body. The surging strength within his body made him felt really amazed. As soon as he sensed it, he smiled. If his raw strength, which was already worth one sun on its own, was combined with the 20 folds increase provided by the Seven-Colored Pellet and the five folds increase provided by his weapons, along with things like the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and the Golden Pellet, he would already achieve a strength worth around 1,000 sun. If he used the Nine Continents Mountain, it would be slightly even higher than 2,000 sun.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He was way too surprised from this sudden burst of his strength. Following the increase in his strength, he could already start to do a lot of things.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui looked forward the most was his spirit energy. Under the effects of the Arhat Rosary Beads, his weapons, the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, as well as his Divine Nebula Formation, it managed to achieve a strength worth around a 1,300 sun. If he used the Roc’s Might, it would achieve a strength worth almost 2,700 sun.</p>
 <p>If the 20% chance of doubling the attack’s prowess were to be met, it would be even more terrifying. However as of now, Qing Shui had already begun to neglect it. After all, it needed a fixed chance for it to happen. It couldn’t really be considered a part of his strength. But now, with this strength of his combined with Emperor’s Qi and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, dealing against a warrior with a strength worth 3,000 sun or more no longer posed a problem. Even a warrior with a strength worth 4,000 sun, Qing Shui also felt that he would be able to deal with it.</p>
 <p>Despite the fact that Qing Shui’s Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation didn’t help to increase his strength, it helped to increase the toughness, sharpness, and so on of some of the substances contained within his spirit energy attacks by multiple folds. For example, his Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. Even if it was to bind itself now around a warrior with 5,000 sun of strength, it would still be able to control the warrior for a period of time. This was the effect of the Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation.</p>
 <p>It could even increase the devouring power of the Spiral Blackhole of his Tidal Cloud Waves Seal.</p>
