 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui brought Beihuang Yu to a deserted place using the Nine Continents Steps. He set up a Formation, released the demonic beast, and then helped Beihuang Yu to heal the hidden illness in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never saw someone with a hidden illness growing so fast. Usually, a genius would have more impurities and hidden illnesses building up. But on the other hand, a genius had a stronger healing ability. Hence, in this case, it would just be similar to an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, it was different in Beihuang Yu’s case. He lost a great amount of his natural healing ability and that caused his hidden illness to build up rapidly. After a breakthrough, the strong existing cells could only delay the breakout of the hidden illness. As time went by, the damage resulting from the hidden illness would increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu was still in disbelief. However, after seeing Qing Shui’s serious look while holding the golden needles, he did not reject it. After all, he only had a short lifespan left. He believed Qing Shui did not have a bad intention, so he did as Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was fast, he put on the Gold Needles one by one. Simultaneously, he led the operation of the Origin Qi in Beihuang Yu’s body. The Force of Rebirth activated the dormant survival strength in Beihuang Yu’s body. The longer it took, the stronger the vital energy in Beihuang Yu’s body become. The hidden illness was also forced to focus on one spot gradually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Gold Needles spread over many areas and expelled the damage of the hidden illness. As Qing Shui held out his hand and tapped on Beihuang Yu’s back, a dark and viscous liquid appeared on the Gold Needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These droplets gave out a stinky fish-like odor and dripped slowly, droplet after droplet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very slow, the green grass on the ground was eroded instantly by this black liquid and dried out, forming a big dried-out patch of grass. The droplets took very long to form, but there were eighty-one Gold Needles in total. Every nine needles formed a small region and one of them secreted the toxin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, only nine Gold Needles were dripping and excreting these impurities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu believed him now; these disgusting objects were currently excreted out of his body. It was hard to believe, but he was extremely astonished. Qing Shui was indeed a Miraculous Physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, he never treated Qing Shui’s Art of Healing seriously, but he was deeply impressed by Qing Shui’s culinary skills. Now that he knew Qing Shui had a really terrific Art of Healing, he really experienced a blessing in disguise. This was much greater than the impurities cleansing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Gold Needles stopped vibrating and excreting black liquid, he stopped the formation, “Stop looking blank and dress up. It is time to go back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu was muddle-headed; he acted as if he were under a kind of illusion and could not differentiate the dream from reality. The current situation only appeared in his dreams. He stared at Qing Shui in disbelief, “Am I dreaming? Try to hit me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui raised his leg and kicked Beihuang Yu away…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It's real, come on, once more…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. After kicking him for more than ten times, Beihuang Yu burst into laughter. He laughed so much that he burst into tears. All these years, he was the genius of the Northern Emperor Domain, the young master of Taiyi Immortal Palace, but he could never be happy. He had a heavy burden which drove him to the point of suffocation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My good brother, tell me, how should I thank you?” Beihuang Yu was over the moon right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good brothers don't talk about this, let's go back. Nuolan is alone there. Although she's fine, it's better to be careful,” Qing Shui led Beihuang Yu back to the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, do you like Nuolan?” asked Beihuang Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know what you're trying to say, a woman shouldn't be given away. Therefore, you don't have to tell me that you're out of the competition. I think you understand me,” Qing Shui interrupted Beihuang Yu and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I got it. No matter what happens in the future, regardless of what we do and what changes, you will be my good brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu left... Qing Shui noticed Nuolan’s sleepy face when he went to her room. She seemed to have just woken up. Her sluggish expression was looking more lively and beautiful at this moment. Still, she looked pale. That did not affect her beauty; it made her look more lovable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you feeling better?” Qing Shui came back to his senses and sat by the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I'm fine!” Nuolan smiled. Then, she sat upright, leaning against the bed frame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a pillow and placed it behind her so that she could lay back comfortably. The gesture was very natural, he nearly hugged her back halfway before putting the pillow behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the moment Qing Shui saw Nuolan almost losing her life after the serious injury, he developed a strange feeling. He was not as restricted as before while facing her. She was like his family. It was so natural to do this now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuolan was confused too. She felt shy in the beginning, but she calmed down as she saw Qing Shui's face. Closing her eyes slightly, she enjoyed the peacefulness in his care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day passed; the battle between the Firecloud Palace and the Divine Palace was set. If the opponent won, the Divine Palace would send Nuolan away; If the Divine Palace won, the Firecloud Palace was not allowed to enter the Northern Emperor Domain anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them agreed. The battle was five against five, life and death were on their own account. In a battle like this, there was no mercy; it was indeed a battle of life or death. After all, having mercy on the enemy was to be cruel to yourself. Perhaps, one single moment of hesitation would get yourself killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The venue was at the Northern Ling between the Northern Emperor Domain and the Firecloud Domain. Northern Ling was a tall mountain located at the central region. It was where many people from the Northern Emperor Domain and the Firecloud Domain lived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no battle stage but there was a notary panel from the Taiyi Immortal Palace and the Blazing Fire Immortal Palace of the Firecloud Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun was scorching on the day, it was especially hot on the Northern Ling Mountain. Besides the people from Taiyi Immortal Palace, Blazing Fire Immortal Palace, Firecloud Palace, and Divine Palace, there were many audiences. The people from the Demon Gate and the Five Tiger Immortal Palace were here too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui met the Lord of Taiyi Immortal Palace this time who was also Beihuang Yu’s grandfather. This was an elderly with grey hair hanging on the sides of his face and wearing a plain white robe. He had a tall and lean body, tall nose, and some wrinkles on the corner of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Qing Shui’s opinion, he looked like a middle-aged man without the grey hair. The hair color made him look like an elderly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His figure was tall and upright like a javelin instead of a sharp sword. He was mature and steady, cultured and profound. Beihuang Yu stood behind him.</span></p>
