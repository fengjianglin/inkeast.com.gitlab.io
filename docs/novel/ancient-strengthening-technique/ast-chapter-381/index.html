 <p><strong>Chapter 381 Basic Sword Technique One with Heaven, Space Sachet?.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 381 - Basic Sword Technique One with Heaven, Interspatial Sachet?</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There is too much helplessness in life.. Qing Shui, thank you for saving the little lass that time, I would never be able to repay your kindness… Our fate now ends here. There is no point in forcing it. You are a smart person, so don’t do anything that you will regret in the future… There’s no need to be sad. You’re made for greater things. It’ll be less painful as time passes, though you still have to endure it for now. You’re a rational man, Qing Shui, endure more, tolerate more…be nice to yourself. I won’t regret, I’ll never regret everything we had…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These words resounded in Qing Shui’s mind repeatedly. Everyone could say the same words. Everyone might have said that there were too much vulnerability in this world, but Qing Shui knew that what he had gone through today had resulted in indescribable pain.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His fists were so tightly clenched that he was unaware of the pool of blood below his palms. Fresh blood from the corner of his mouth had stained the front of his robe red.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had always thought that he would be able to protect people around him when his abilities were enhanced, but what happened today made Qing Shui realize how weak and small he was.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The look of inexpressible downcast reflected the fatigue in his heart. The sound of the little lass’ cries echoed in his ears, and every plea to not leave seemed to stab his heart…&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, don’t be like this. You can bring Mingyue back next time. She did this for your own good, for the good of the whole. You would have done the same if you were her, won’t you?” Qing Yi wrapped her arms around Qing Shui and consoled him, her heart aching at the same time. She knew his vulnerability now, as well as his personality. No one knew her son like her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, I’m useless...so useless…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let me tell you, it is like Mingyue said. There are times when we feel helpless, but we live on. Just like how Qing Qing was brought away that time, my heart shattered. Mother knows how you feel. Mother is useless, but you, my son, are different. Endure a little, endure a little…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, I understand. I know all these, but the grievances in my heart are slashing it apart. Mother, half a year, half a year at most and you will be able to find the Yan Family. After that, three years after that, I will bring Mingyue back!” Qing Shui planned to leave for Sword Tower in three years, and when the time came, he wouldn’t mind killing some people.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very depressed. Anyone would be if they were in his shoes. He did not expect that husband of hers to come with such great abilities and high status.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had thought that, even if he wasn’t able to do as he pleased in Greencloud Continent, there would not be anyone bothering him. However, Qing Shui now discovered that he was barely near the super warriors in Greencloud Continent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head as he thought about when he could act freely without being controlled or threatened by anyone. The bitterness in his heart had rendered him speechless.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would never forget the words Mingyue Gelou whispered in his ears when she left!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, he wouldn’t dare to touch me. I, Mingyue Gelou, am yours, and will belong to you forever. I won’t let anyone touch me except you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These words made it unbearable for Qing Shui, for it was the very thing that mattered most to him. It was most unacceptable. After all, she was now his woman.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Today, as he watched her leave reluctantly, Qing Shui knew she did it for him. If he had stopped her, she would have ended her life there and then, because that would save Qing Shui and his family, as well as her daughter.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, if Qing Shui had made any moves, everyone could have been dead today…&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time flew, and three months passed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within these three months, Qing Family gained another Xiantian martial!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Jiang had had a breakthrough!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Old Master Qing Luo had come to Hundred Miles City thrice, and each time, a happy occasion brought him smiles. Qing Family hoped for Qing Luo to remain in Hundred Miles City, but no matter how much they persuaded, Qing Luo returned to Qing Village.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In three months, Qing Shui’s abilities greatly improved. Possibly because of what happened to Mingyue Gelou, Qing Shui became less easily amused and quieter, which worried everyone in Qing Family.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three months was equivalent to almost eight years in the Realm of Violet Immortal. It had been tougher for him during training, most likely because the matter with Mingyue Gelou had been gnawing at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now that the Ancient Strengthening Technique had reached 130 cycles, his abilities were strengthened yet another time. Every cycle increased Qing Shui’s entire capabilities by 1%, be it strength, speed, or resistance...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hence, as he gained more cycles, his ability enhancement would be greater. For instance, the increment gained from 130 cycles would be equivalent to 2 times of that gained from 101 cycles.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was also the reason why it became tougher to train as one progressed in the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In terms of Alchemy, ever since the “Wind Water Primordial Pellet”, a new medicinal pellet was discovered - “Everlasting Pellet”, 100 experience.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at this great amount of experience made Qing Shui feel weak, but it was alright for now, as he could cultivate “Spirit Concentrating Pill” and other pellets that require further increase in experience. Cultivating medicinal pellets like Golden Sore Ointment would be impossible for now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Other martial techniques were also enhanced, even those that had reached great perfection stage. Qing Shui had known that the great perfection stage was not the final stage, but it would be especially difficult to gain any enhancement after that.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peach of Immortality has ripened and was picked by Qing Shui. “Divine Feet Clearing” has also attained the pinnacle of large success stage, though the opportunity for breakthrough was yet to be discovered.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Also, Qing Shui had spent much of his time on the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Taichi Fist, and Basic Sword Techniques.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Basic Sword Techniques remained in the obscure realm, though Qing Shui had devoted time and energy to it. It looked like some luck was still needed for one to breakthrough and attain “One with Heaven”.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already quite satisfied with the huge improvement in his Ancient Strengthening Technique, but the most important part was for him to re-forge his suit of armour and Big Dipper Sword after he attained the obscure realm of Thousand Hammer Technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wristlet: 30% increase in Damage, 200 increase in Strength, 100 increase in Agility, 100 increase in Endurance. Only 1 wristlet would incur damage, regardless of the number donned. Additional 30% increase in Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Upper body armour: 30 % increase in Defence for specified area, 350 increase in Strength, 300 increase in Endurance, 150 increase in Agility! Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lower body armour: 30% increase in Defence for specified area, 350 increase in Strength, 300 increase in Endurance, 150 increase in Agility. Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Helmet: &nbsp;30% increase in Defence for specified area, 150 increase in Strength, 150 increase in Endurance, 150 increase in Agility, 20 increase in Energy! Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">War boots: 30% increase in speed, 400 increase in Strength, 200 increase in Endurance, 300 increase in Agility! Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A wristlet forged through 3-color graded Art of Forging actually included effects of Frenzied Bull Strength. From what Qing Shui knew, 2-color graded wristlet did not contain attributes of the Frenzied Bull Strength.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he wore each piece of armour, there was an instant surge of strange power from it that fused with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Frenzied Bull Strength, and Nature Energy...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui laid eyes on the Big Dipper Sword, he realized that there was no difference!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Big Dipper Sword: 50% increase in Attach, 500 increase in Strength, 300 increase in Endurance, 300 increase in Agility, 50 increase in Energy, with an additional State of the 7 Stars Armour.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">7 Stars Armour: 1 time increase in Defense that lasts an hour each day. Cultivate the Qi of the 7 Stars to activate its use!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know why there was no change in the Big Dipper Sword this time. He guessed that the previous change could have been due to the White Tiger Stone, and there probably would not have been any effect if he had used the 2-color graded Art of Forging. After all, even the 3-color graded Art of Forging had null effect on the Big Dipper Sword.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held the Big Dipper Sword. He now felt much, much more powerful than when he had broken through the 5th Wave, even stronger than how he was three months ago.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that his physical strength was now about 3,000,000 kg, including 40% of his Frenzied Bull Strength, 30% Frenzied Bull Strength from his armour, 30% Strength from Thunder Slash, 50% Strength from his weapons, and other cumulated attributes from his armour and weapons.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Including the martial techniques, his strength could be as much as 5,000,000 kg!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Combining the enhancements of the weapons and his armour, Qing Shui’s strength had attained a fearfully enormous strength of 7,500,000 kg!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Immense strength of 7,500,000 kg!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wore his Golden-Ringed Battle Armor that had 3 colour swirling on it and carried his simple yet majestic Big Dipper Sword, which gave off an air of arrogance. That moment, he knew how it felt to look disdainfully from the corner of his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The increase in Strength was only part of it. There were also boosts in his Immovability of Mountains, Nature Energy and Speed, as the advancement in Strength was directly related to Divine Arm Clearing and Divine Feet Clearing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Basic Sword Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One pierce of the sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sword stabbed through the air, and the heavens and earth became discoloured. It was as if the seemingly simple sword technique had returned to its original nature; every stab was direct and sharp, with an unsolvable secret within it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Basic Sword Technique One with Heaven?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like his Basic Sword Technique had entered the realm of One with Heaven, but was unsure, though that sensation was definitely what one would have when attaining the realm of One with Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A soundless, stirless breakthrough…&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It looked like the days of visiting the Yan Family had neared...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After exiting the Realm of Violet Immortal, Qing Shui realized that there were visitors!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liuli!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It has almost been three months since they met. The two ladies had come once before Mingyue Gelous left, and now as well!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two ladies were as beautiful as before, even more radiant than they were in the past. However, they felt uncomfortable now that they were seeing Qing Shui - even though Qing Shui was looking at them with a smile, they were pained by the look in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was an inconcealable anguish in those pair of clear eyes!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, how are you? Did anything happen?” Huoyun Liuli held onto Qing Shui’s arm, concerned. Her action was natural, as though she had done the same thing thousands of times before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liuli was in a purple pleated dress. Her shoulders looked as though they were carved by a sharp knife, appearing especially alluring as she held Qing Shui’s arms. Her sexy eyes stared at Qing Shui in concern.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Though Canghai Mingyue was quiet, that pair of beautiful, dark eyes were similarly filled with care!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nothing, nothing happened. Have you been well at Cang Lang County!” Three months’ time was sufficient for Qing Shui to get used to his scarred heart, though it hadn’t healed yet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Habit is a scary thing, for things will rationalize when one is habituated. Qing Shui knew he was not actually habitualized, for he had been forcing himself to get used to it and forget about it temporarily.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui brought the two ladies upstairs. Ever since the incident three months ago, Qing Shui had moved to the lower level to avoid seeing the room Mingyue Gelou had stayed in.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was no unfamiliarity even after three months, especially Huoyun Liuli, who looked dazed for a while before smiling and saying, “I’ll go home and take a look.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and nodded. He would have forgotten that her home was in Hundred Miles City if not for that. Qing Shui remained silent, as he was afraid that Canghai Mingyue might be reminded of any unhappiness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liuli, similarly, thought of that and left with a grin!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even with that, there was a flash of unnaturalness in Canghai Mingyue’s eyes. To divert her attention, Qing Shui took out from his “chest” the sachet he had picked up last time.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yueyue, come and see what beast hide is this sachet made of!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Interspatial Silk Sachet!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was a cry from Canghai Mingyue!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Interspatial Silk Sachet? What’s that?” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue, baffled. He was happy that Canghai Mingyue seemed to know this item, but did that mean she also knew what the 3 ceramic bottles contained…?</p>

 <p dir="ltr">He had always thought that he would be able to protect people around him when his abilities were enhanced, but what happened today made Qing Shui realize how weak and small he was.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The look of inexpressible downcast reflected the fatigue in his heart. The sound of the little lass’ cries echoed in his ears, and every plea to not leave seemed to stab his heart…&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, don’t be like this. You can bring Mingyue back next time. She did this for your own good, for the good of the whole. You would have done the same if you were her, won’t you?” Qing Yi wrapped her arms around Qing Shui and consoled him, her heart aching at the same time. She knew his vulnerability now, as well as his personality. No one knew her son like her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, I’m useless...so useless…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let me tell you, it is like Mingyue said. There are times when we feel helpless, but we live on. Just like how Qing Qing was brought away that time, my heart shattered. Mother knows how you feel. Mother is useless, but you, my son, are different. Endure a little, endure a little…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, I understand. I know all these, but the grievances in my heart are slashing it apart. Mother, half a year, half a year at most and you will be able to find the Yan Family. After that, three years after that, I will bring Mingyue back!” Qing Shui planned to leave for Sword Tower in three years, and when the time came, he wouldn’t mind killing some people.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very depressed. Anyone would be if they were in his shoes. He did not expect that husband of hers to come with such great abilities and high status.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had thought that, even if he wasn’t able to do as he pleased in Greencloud Continent, there would not be anyone bothering him. However, Qing Shui now discovered that he was barely near the super warriors in Greencloud Continent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head as he thought about when he could act freely without being controlled or threatened by anyone. The bitterness in his heart had rendered him speechless.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would never forget the words Mingyue Gelou whispered in his ears when she left!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, he wouldn’t dare to touch me. I, Mingyue Gelou, am yours, and will belong to you forever. I won’t let anyone touch me except you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These words made it unbearable for Qing Shui, for it was the very thing that mattered most to him. It was most unacceptable. After all, she was now his woman.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Today, as he watched her leave reluctantly, Qing Shui knew she did it for him. If he had stopped her, she would have ended her life there and then, because that would save Qing Shui and his family, as well as her daughter.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, if Qing Shui had made any moves, everyone could have been dead today…&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time flew, and three months passed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Within these three months, Qing Family gained another Xiantian martial!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Jiang had had a breakthrough!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Old Master Qing Luo had come to Hundred Miles City thrice, and each time, a happy occasion brought him smiles. Qing Family hoped for Qing Luo to remain in Hundred Miles City, but no matter how much they persuaded, Qing Luo returned to Qing Village.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In three months, Qing Shui’s abilities greatly improved. Possibly because of what happened to Mingyue Gelou, Qing Shui became less easily amused and quieter, which worried everyone in Qing Family.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Three months was equivalent to almost eight years in the Realm of Violet Immortal. It had been tougher for him during training, most likely because the matter with Mingyue Gelou had been gnawing at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now that the Ancient Strengthening Technique had reached 130 cycles, his abilities were strengthened yet another time. Every cycle increased Qing Shui’s entire capabilities by 1%, be it strength, speed, or resistance...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hence, as he gained more cycles, his ability enhancement would be greater. For instance, the increment gained from 130 cycles would be equivalent to 2 times of that gained from 101 cycles.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was also the reason why it became tougher to train as one progressed in the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In terms of Alchemy, ever since the “Wind Water Primordial Pellet”, a new medicinal pellet was discovered - “Everlasting Pellet”, 100 experience.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at this great amount of experience made Qing Shui feel weak, but it was alright for now, as he could cultivate “Spirit Concentrating Pill” and other pellets that require further increase in experience. Cultivating medicinal pellets like Golden Sore Ointment would be impossible for now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Other martial techniques were also enhanced, even those that had reached great perfection stage. Qing Shui had known that the great perfection stage was not the final stage, but it would be especially difficult to gain any enhancement after that.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Peach of Immortality has ripened and was picked by Qing Shui. “Divine Feet Clearing” has also attained the pinnacle of large success stage, though the opportunity for breakthrough was yet to be discovered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Also, Qing Shui had spent much of his time on the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Taichi Fist, and Basic Sword Techniques.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Basic Sword Techniques remained in the obscure realm, though Qing Shui had devoted time and energy to it. It looked like some luck was still needed for one to breakthrough and attain “One with Heaven”.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already quite satisfied with the huge improvement in his Ancient Strengthening Technique, but the most important part was for him to re-forge his suit of armour and Big Dipper Sword after he attained the obscure realm of Thousand Hammer Technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wristlet: 30% increase in Damage, 200 increase in Strength, 100 increase in Agility, 100 increase in Endurance. Only 1 wristlet would incur damage, regardless of the number donned. Additional 30% increase in Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Upper body armour: 30 % increase in Defence for specified area, 350 increase in Strength, 300 increase in Endurance, 150 increase in Agility! Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lower body armour: 30% increase in Defence for specified area, 350 increase in Strength, 300 increase in Endurance, 150 increase in Agility. Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Helmet: &nbsp;30% increase in Defence for specified area, 150 increase in Strength, 150 increase in Endurance, 150 increase in Agility, 20 increase in Energy! Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">War boots: 30% increase in speed, 400 increase in Strength, 200 increase in Endurance, 300 increase in Agility! Additional 30% effect of Frenzied Bull Strength that takes effect only with a minimum of 3 pieces of armour and weapons of the same attribute!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A wristlet forged through 3-color graded Art of Forging actually included effects of Frenzied Bull Strength. From what Qing Shui knew, 2-color graded wristlet did not contain attributes of the Frenzied Bull Strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he wore each piece of armour, there was an instant surge of strange power from it that fused with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Frenzied Bull Strength, and Nature Energy...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui laid eyes on the Big Dipper Sword, he realized that there was no difference!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Big Dipper Sword: 50% increase in Attach, 500 increase in Strength, 300 increase in Endurance, 300 increase in Agility, 50 increase in Energy, with an additional State of the 7 Stars Armour.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">7 Stars Armour: 1 time increase in Defense that lasts an hour each day. Cultivate the Qi of the 7 Stars to activate its use!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know why there was no change in the Big Dipper Sword this time. He guessed that the previous change could have been due to the White Tiger Stone, and there probably would not have been any effect if he had used the 2-color graded Art of Forging. After all, even the 3-color graded Art of Forging had null effect on the Big Dipper Sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held the Big Dipper Sword. He now felt much, much more powerful than when he had broken through the 5th Wave, even stronger than how he was three months ago.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that his physical strength was now about 3,000,000 kg, including 40% of his Frenzied Bull Strength, 30% Frenzied Bull Strength from his armour, 30% Strength from Thunder Slash, 50% Strength from his weapons, and other cumulated attributes from his armour and weapons.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Including the martial techniques, his strength could be as much as 5,000,000 kg!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Combining the enhancements of the weapons and his armour, Qing Shui’s strength had attained a fearfully enormous strength of 7,500,000 kg!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Immense strength of 7,500,000 kg!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wore his Golden-Ringed Battle Armor that had 3 colour swirling on it and carried his simple yet majestic Big Dipper Sword, which gave off an air of arrogance. That moment, he knew how it felt to look disdainfully from the corner of his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The increase in Strength was only part of it. There were also boosts in his Immovability of Mountains, Nature Energy and Speed, as the advancement in Strength was directly related to Divine Arm Clearing and Divine Feet Clearing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Basic Sword Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One pierce of the sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sword stabbed through the air, and the heavens and earth became discoloured. It was as if the seemingly simple sword technique had returned to its original nature; every stab was direct and sharp, with an unsolvable secret within it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Basic Sword Technique One with Heaven?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like his Basic Sword Technique had entered the realm of One with Heaven, but was unsure, though that sensation was definitely what one would have when attaining the realm of One with Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A soundless, stirless breakthrough…&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It looked like the days of visiting the Yan Family had neared...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After exiting the Realm of Violet Immortal, Qing Shui realized that there were visitors!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liuli!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It has almost been three months since they met. The two ladies had come once before Mingyue Gelous left, and now as well!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two ladies were as beautiful as before, even more radiant than they were in the past. However, they felt uncomfortable now that they were seeing Qing Shui - even though Qing Shui was looking at them with a smile, they were pained by the look in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was an inconcealable anguish in those pair of clear eyes!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, how are you? Did anything happen?” Huoyun Liuli held onto Qing Shui’s arm, concerned. Her action was natural, as though she had done the same thing thousands of times before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liuli was in a purple pleated dress. Her shoulders looked as though they were carved by a sharp knife, appearing especially alluring as she held Qing Shui’s arms. Her sexy eyes stared at Qing Shui in concern.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Though Canghai Mingyue was quiet, that pair of beautiful, dark eyes were similarly filled with care!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Nothing, nothing happened. Have you been well at Cang Lang County!” Three months’ time was sufficient for Qing Shui to get used to his scarred heart, though it hadn’t healed yet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Habit is a scary thing, for things will rationalize when one is habituated. Qing Shui knew he was not actually habitualized, for he had been forcing himself to get used to it and forget about it temporarily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui brought the two ladies upstairs. Ever since the incident three months ago, Qing Shui had moved to the lower level to avoid seeing the room Mingyue Gelou had stayed in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was no unfamiliarity even after three months, especially Huoyun Liuli, who looked dazed for a while before smiling and saying, “I’ll go home and take a look.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and nodded. He would have forgotten that her home was in Hundred Miles City if not for that. Qing Shui remained silent, as he was afraid that Canghai Mingyue might be reminded of any unhappiness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liuli, similarly, thought of that and left with a grin!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even with that, there was a flash of unnaturalness in Canghai Mingyue’s eyes. To divert her attention, Qing Shui took out from his “chest” the sachet he had picked up last time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yueyue, come and see what beast hide is this sachet made of!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Interspatial Silk Sachet!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was a cry from Canghai Mingyue!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Interspatial Silk Sachet? What’s that?” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue, baffled. He was happy that Canghai Mingyue seemed to know this item, but did that mean she also knew what the 3 ceramic bottles contained…?</p>
