 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where is the Gold-back Bear King?</span></p>

It was about as tall as a person, about as thick as an adult’s arm, upright and powerful, so much so that if the sky were to fall on it it would still be able to hold against it, spreading out a&nbsp;strong aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Growing on it were ten Diamond Fruits as large as a fist, Qing Shui’s eyes brightened when he caught sight of it, saying: “Diamond Fruit!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The King Kong-like bear, strong and vigorous, with a bow-shaped back, four strong and sharp claws, sharp teeth, and with a menacing stare that locked onto Qing Shui and the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately felt how scary the strength of this Gold-back Bear King was, from his perspective it wasn’t much weaker than him, but Qing Shui knew that this Gold-back Bear King’s strength came from its penetrating and scary defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Diamond Fruit is one of the treasures of the universe, it could be put into medicine or just consumed directly, if it was going to be used directly when the user would have to have at least the power level of a Martial Saint, in addition, the benefits from the fruit are affected by the power and constitution of the person who was consuming it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s eyes brightened and turned to the woman: “So you came here for the Diamond Fruit.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As of now I really have nothing, we’ll see later,” the woman said, playing down the situation, and then nodded to signify that the Gold-back Bear King was rushing over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman raised her hand, spinning out a palm mark, and it came onto the Gold-back Bear King like ripples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang bang...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman moved her palm, and a rippled mark slowly spun out.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you want to try this Gold-back Bear King?” the woman asked Qing Shui without turning back.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taichi fist!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The giant body of the Gold-back Bear King was propelled out by Qing Shui, although it wasn’t far, Qing Shui followed the bear out and hit it again.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the woman was shocked at the time because she found out that Qing Shui’s artistic style with Taichi was possibly better than her own, that kind of boundary and grace was unknown to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Gold-back Bear King’s strength was still not capped, Qing Shui didn’t really care about attacking it, as if he was unable to hurt his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Gold-back Bear King was quite similar to the Super Shield Beast, actually even stronger, of course, the Super Shield Beast couldn’t be compared with Qing Shui’s Region Nightmare Beast, but this Gold-back Bear King wouldn’t be much weaker compared to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui withdrew after attacking for a while, he wanted to see how this woman would kill the Gold-back Bear King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman seemed to understand Qing Shui’s intentions, smiled slightly, this smile was extremely charming, devastatingly beautiful, Qing Shui was stunned, but quickly shook his head, as if he was trying to shake all he saw away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was surprised then reached out and made another ripple-like thing with her hands, which Qing Shui knew the purpose of now, these ripples were of the Control Power, didn’t have much damaging ability, but it didn’t matter whether they had a high defense or a high speed, these ripples could still prevent movement very well, of course, the extent of its power would be dependent on the target’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly the woman put her hands together, a drop of water-like liquid as large as the fist of a baby, sparkling and clear, shining with the light of a strange charm, sending a strong spiritual influence towards the Gold-back Bear King.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned at this moment. The killing power of this mysterious droplet seemed extremely great. This should be a trump card of the woman, one must know how insanely high the defence of the bear king was, yet this droplet of water could easily penetrate through its hide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Qing Shui was stunned again since this giant bear was being toyed with by such a small weird liquid thing when the giant Gold-back Bear King finally toppled down, Qing Shui was in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that if the woman and he switched places, the bear would still be dead. Of course, that didn’t mean that the Gold-back Bear King wasn’t strong, if he was the one fighting, he would still need to expend a lot of effort...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also large paws, the bear penis..., when the woman came back, Qing Shui was just holding that large appendage, and her face turned red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t think that a woman such as her would grow red from this, this woman is supposed to be very strong and powerful, but she was still a woman at heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Qing Shui still asked naturally, “Good stuff here, you want it?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t you save it for yourself then!” the woman said rashly, even her cold voice was still good to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched the woman hand five Diamond Fruits towards him: “These are for you.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, then can I have the tree,” Qing Shui felt that he was impolite doing this, pointing at the tree as he said so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t be thinking of transplanting it right?” the woman looked at Qing Shui weirdly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, leaving it here would be quite a waste,” Qing Shui said honestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know if you really don’t know this or if you’re faking it but the Diamond Fruit takes a few thousand years to ripen each time, in addition, the tree would die if it were moved, are you thinking of using the Diamond Fruit tree as materials?” the woman didn’t trust what Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a little gloomy, sometimes when he said the truth people didn’t believe him, and he was too lazy to explain, so he just nodded his head, or the woman would think that he was kidding before as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used four hours to move the Diamond Fruit tree, being wary of damaging too much of the root system. Even a woman of her stature didn’t think too much of it, thinking instead that he was using the roots in medicine, and needed to keep it intact as a result. There were many rules to being an Alchemist, which the woman didn’t understand, and just watched from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s hand entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and looked for an excuse to find someplace convenient for him to enter it, plant the Diamond Fruit tree, water it with the Spring of Life as well as water soaked by the Great Sacred Buddha Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having done all this, Qing Shui was finally able to relax, his business here was done. Qing Shui then went forward into the treasure room and suddenly conceived of a new thought, pulling the woman along with him since she was so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there anything urgent you need to do?” Qing Shui saw that there wasn’t anything left here, and normally this was there they would each part ways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, is there something you want?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman stared blankly at Qing Shui: “You’re not afraid that I would attack you halfway through?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really are cunning, let’s go then,” The woman flew into the sky.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui still didn’t know what the woman was called, actually, he didn’t know anything about the woman except that she was a woman, and said curiously: “I just realized that I know nothing about you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you need to know!” the woman said with a smile, facing Qing Shui, it was very generous, very graceful, the shyness and reproach before seemed to have become faintly discernible.</span></p>
