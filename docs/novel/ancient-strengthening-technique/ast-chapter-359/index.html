  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 359 The Appearance of Shi Qingzhuang, Yu Donghao's Intentions</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also got all three of the Qing Clan's generations practice Taichi daily. They must be able to reach that mental state! In the day they must also practice hard, and make use of the amazing effects of the Spirit Concentrating Pill.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Qing Clan's business was left to 3rd Uncle Qing Hu and his wife, Qing Hai and his wife, as well as Qing Yi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since Qing Shui wiped out the Situ Clan, endless people came and knocked on their doors. Many reputable characters in Hundred Miles City all came to the Qing Clan bearing valuable gifts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of these people had all but given up on Qing Clan at the most crucial moment. Yet now they came to curry up to them. Qing Shui did not pay much heed to this, and just accepted all of their gifts with no exceptions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew very well that these people were just putting up an act to express their close relationship with the Qing Clan, and also to gain favor in their eyes. They were far more afraid that the Qing Clan would take it out on them, which was why they had hoped that the Qing Clan would accept their gifts. If they did, in the future if they were to be faced with any problems, while they may not have hopes that the Qing Clan would help them, it was not completely impossible for them to.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were no such things as permanent friends or foe, only everlasting gains. The only reason betrayal did not exist was because the price for making one turn their backs was not high enough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Having gone through many jumps of progression in his mental state, Qing Shui had experienced subtle changes to the way he saw things. Just like this he was able to handle these rich merchants or members of reputable clans with great ease.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But it was clear to everyone that this was just a show. As Qing Shui took up the lead position, they could only lower themselves and try to curry favor, in hopes that they were able to survive and flourish in Hundred Miles City. Of course, if the Qing Clan could reach out a helping hand during the times they were down in the pits, it would be perfect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had never thought of doing anything to these people, so he would feel sorry for himself if he did not accept those free gifts. As for how people saw him, Qing Shui did not really care. It would be too tiring to be constantly overly concerned about how other people see you. It also would be good as long as he himself, as well as his family and friends understood him. There was no need to make everyone satisfied, nor did he have the ability to.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Late in the morning, a special guest arrived at the Qing Clan. It was the Shi Clan's Shi Qingzhuang! And she carried another identity with her, which was Qing Shui's fiancee.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The lady with beauty that transcended the human world wore a fiery red knight suit as usual. Her curvy body exuded an aura which gave one the urge to be impulsive, and her cold beautiful eyes and slightly perky sexy lips exuded a coldness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lady with unparalleled beauty of ice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the first time Qing Shui had seen her, to the feelings he felt right then and there had not changed even now. It was as if she was engraved in Qing Shui's heart, forever so clear. He could not forget everything that had happened between them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since he had met her back in Skysword Sect the previous time, he had not seen her. He had not expected that she had returned as well, and did not know when she had done so.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked up happily to the cold beauty who stood at the door!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"When did you come back?" Qing Shui walked over, and naturally picked up her hand and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her small hand was slightly cold, soft and tender to the touch, as if there were no bones. As before, Qing Shui was extremely attracted to her. He had left the most traces on her, and most importantly, she had given the most delicate feeling to Qing Shui. From the beginning till now, everything was so beautiful. If not, he would not have snatched her from the Situ Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang did not do anything, but let Qing Shui hold her hand. She only looked at Qing Shui seriously, as if she wanted to see through him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Did I change to look better?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"No!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Have I become more manly?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"No!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly, "Then why are you staring at me like that? Is it because I'm very good-looking?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You're not good-looking, but you don't look bad either. I just don't understand why so many women like you." Shi Qingzhuang threw a sideward glance at Qing Shui, and said without holding back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very dreamy when he was stared at by that cold and slightly feminine gaze of hers. He smiled thick-skinnedly and said, "Thanks for the compliment... Do you like me?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui noticed that his voice trembled a little. He did not notice that his hand which held onto Shi Qingzhuang's was also trembling slightly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang had also not expected that he would be so concerned over her feelings. As she thought of how she had thought of him as a big child when she first met him, she had no good feelings about him, let alone talk about liking him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Until the series of events that had happened in Hundred Miles City later, and even she herself got involved, did Qing Shui's figure seem to have be engraved onto her soul. There was not a single day she had not thought about him, but it was also a complicated feeling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was very troubled. Initially, she held great hatred for him, and even felt that she was given no choice at all. Therefore, when Qing Shui came to "snatch the bride", she accepted it. However, she felt that her feelings towards Qing Shui were not that of love.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like that, until the day she had met Qing Shui at Skysword Sect. She had thought that she was going to die, but this man, this guy who had unknowingly become a man to her, once again appeared. His concern towards her made her feel very happy. It was an especially wonderful feeling, and she had even felt a little dependent and yearned for him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now that she had returned to her home, she heard that Qing Shui had just killed one who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian, and had even eradicated the Situ Clan from the roots. All this for the sake of one woman, although it was also for his Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Do you want to listen to the truth or lies?" Shi Qingzhuang gave a rare smile, and looked at Qing Shui who appeared to be slightly nervous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Forget it, I'm better off not knowing. I'll wait for you to tell me after you've fallen in love with me. Come, let's go in first." Qing Shui smiled and said, as he pulled her towards the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Aren't you afraid that the other two women will see?" Shi Qingzhuang followed Qing Shui back, and asked puzzledly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. "You are my fiancee. What's so surprising about me holding your hand? Even if I were to bring you back to my room to do the things we love to do, it's all natural. What do you think?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang did not reproach Qing Shui, but still turned her head to look at this man who spoke to her very casually and relaxed. In the past, he was not as confident, nor as fluent when he was saying such stuff. However, he was obviously very nervous earlier, and had even rejected to hear her reply. It was because he was afraid of having to hear a certain answer.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What do you mean things we love to do? What do we love to do?" Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui, and said softly as her expression returned to her previous coldness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled, and did not continue. He was really worried that she would be angry. After all, they had not met for over two years, and he did not know how much she had changed. Otherwise, it would not have been such that he did not even dare to hear her reply to see if she liked him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What we love to do is for me to hold your hand like this..." Qing Shui felt that he had to give an answer, but yet was afraid that it would be awkward if he were to mention that topic. Qing Shui acknowledged that he did not have the talent to handle such topics.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You coward! Saying one thing despite thinking about another!" Shi Qingzhuang smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'm not a coward. I'm just afraid that you won't like to hear that. It's that thing that we had done together before! Oh, how I missed it!" As he saw that Shi Qingzhuang had smiled, Qing Shui knew that she would not be angry.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Truly, Shi Qingzhuang only threw a reproachful sideward glance towards Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, I'm actually very, very worried!" Shi Qingzhuang followed Qing Shui back to the house.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What are you worried about?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui asked, but did not receive a reply.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qingzhuang!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi smiled and walked over!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Aunty!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang smiled and walked towards Qing Yi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi took up Shi Qingzhuang's hand and said, "Qing Shui, you're back. Old Master Yu is here and is in the living room. Go take a look!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Alright!" Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and only headed to the hall after his mother's and Shi Qingzhuang's silhouettes had disappeared from his vision!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once he entered, Qing Shui saw that Yu Donghao was seated on an old-fashioned wooden armchair, with 3rd Uncle Qing Hu chatting harmoniously beside him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After they saw Qing Shui, Yu Donghao stood up, and looked at him with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old Master Yu! It's been very long since we'd last met!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although it had been a while since they last met, they were not that awkward with each other. Before he left, Qing Shui had requested for Yu Donghao's help to keep a lookout for the Qing Clan and the latter had also agreed, and did so until only after Mingyue Gelou had ascended to Xiantian and surpassed him in terms of their abilities. He had felt that the Qing Clan could stand up for themselves. Even without Mingyue Gelou with just Qing Shui alone, who had a great future before him, it was sufficient.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One look at Yu Donghao and Qing Shui could tell that he had suffered from internal injuries, and it was quite serious. He knew that Li Long must have done that. However, Qing Shui felt that Yu Donghao should have felt thankful that the other party did not think of taking his life. Otherwise, it was just a piece of cake for one who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian to kill him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Haha, that's right, it's been awhile. Qing Shui, now you've made it big! It's truly worth celebrating!" After he saw Qing Shui, Yu Donghao's eyes flashed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">3rd Uncle Qing Hu was also brimming with smiles. The Qing Clan today was unlike before, and every one of them had a strong sense of superiority, all because of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and walked over, he reached out his hand and quickly slapped &nbsp;Yu Donghao's chest and stomach very quickly over tens of times. With the repeated slapping sounds, Yu Donghao's pale face started to turn red.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui withdrew his hands, it had turned slightly transparent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old Master Yu, you will be able to recover fully after a few days' rest!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Thank you! It is really a supreme stroke of luck for this old man to have met you!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Yu Donghao said this, he still felt a slightly regretful that back then, he did not thicken up his skin to push Qing Shui and Yu He together. Now, there was no way that he could say that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui were to be with his granddaughter now, in the future, the Yu Clan may also go through a tremendous change in the future. It was really a pity. One day, their affinity with the Qing Clan would eventually come to an end.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yu Donghao did not have much reason to drop by, but his intentions were very clear. He hoped that the Qing Clan and Yu Clan could continue to have a good relationship in all areas.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yu Donghao had even mentioned Yu He, and said that she was at Yu Clan. Subtly he said that she missed Qing Shui. However, he did not say much, nor did he request for anything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He merely wished to see Qing Shui's attitude. For example, if Yu He still had a chance. The reason he had said these to Qing Shui was because he wanted to see if Qing Shui was still interested in his granddaughter. As for whether she still had a chance, it would all be left to fate.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yu Donghao had yet to give up on Qing Shui!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">From the first time Qing Shui had seen her, to the feelings he felt right then and there had not changed even now. It was as if she was engraved in Qing Shui's heart, forever so clear. He could not forget everything that had happened between them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ever since he had met her back in Skysword Sect the previous time, he had not seen her. He had not expected that she had returned as well, and did not know when she had done so.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked up happily to the cold beauty who stood at the door!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"When did you come back?" Qing Shui walked over, and naturally picked up her hand and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her small hand was slightly cold, soft and tender to the touch, as if there were no bones. As before, Qing Shui was extremely attracted to her. He had left the most traces on her, and most importantly, she had given the most delicate feeling to Qing Shui. From the beginning till now, everything was so beautiful. If not, he would not have snatched her from the Situ Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang did not do anything, but let Qing Shui hold her hand. She only looked at Qing Shui seriously, as if she wanted to see through him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Did I change to look better?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"No!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Have I become more manly?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"No!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly, "Then why are you staring at me like that? Is it because I'm very good-looking?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You're not good-looking, but you don't look bad either. I just don't understand why so many women like you." Shi Qingzhuang threw a sideward glance at Qing Shui, and said without holding back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very dreamy when he was stared at by that cold and slightly feminine gaze of hers. He smiled thick-skinnedly and said, "Thanks for the compliment... Do you like me?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui noticed that his voice trembled a little. He did not notice that his hand which held onto Shi Qingzhuang's was also trembling slightly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang had also not expected that he would be so concerned over her feelings. As she thought of how she had thought of him as a big child when she first met him, she had no good feelings about him, let alone talk about liking him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Until the series of events that had happened in Hundred Miles City later, and even she herself got involved, did Qing Shui's figure seem to have be engraved onto her soul. There was not a single day she had not thought about him, but it was also a complicated feeling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was very troubled. Initially, she held great hatred for him, and even felt that she was given no choice at all. Therefore, when Qing Shui came to "snatch the bride", she accepted it. However, she felt that her feelings towards Qing Shui were not that of love.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like that, until the day she had met Qing Shui at Skysword Sect. She had thought that she was going to die, but this man, this guy who had unknowingly become a man to her, once again appeared. His concern towards her made her feel very happy. It was an especially wonderful feeling, and she had even felt a little dependent and yearned for him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now that she had returned to her home, she heard that Qing Shui had just killed one who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian, and had even eradicated the Situ Clan from the roots. All this for the sake of one woman, although it was also for his Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Do you want to listen to the truth or lies?" Shi Qingzhuang gave a rare smile, and looked at Qing Shui who appeared to be slightly nervous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Forget it, I'm better off not knowing. I'll wait for you to tell me after you've fallen in love with me. Come, let's go in first." Qing Shui smiled and said, as he pulled her towards the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Aren't you afraid that the other two women will see?" Shi Qingzhuang followed Qing Shui back, and asked puzzledly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. "You are my fiancee. What's so surprising about me holding your hand? Even if I were to bring you back to my room to do the things we love to do, it's all natural. What do you think?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang did not reproach Qing Shui, but still turned her head to look at this man who spoke to her very casually and relaxed. In the past, he was not as confident, nor as fluent when he was saying such stuff. However, he was obviously very nervous earlier, and had even rejected to hear her reply. It was because he was afraid of having to hear a certain answer.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What do you mean things we love to do? What do we love to do?" Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui, and said softly as her expression returned to her previous coldness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled, and did not continue. He was really worried that she would be angry. After all, they had not met for over two years, and he did not know how much she had changed. Otherwise, it would not have been such that he did not even dare to hear her reply to see if she liked him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What we love to do is for me to hold your hand like this..." Qing Shui felt that he had to give an answer, but yet was afraid that it would be awkward if he were to mention that topic. Qing Shui acknowledged that he did not have the talent to handle such topics.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You coward! Saying one thing despite thinking about another!" Shi Qingzhuang smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'm not a coward. I'm just afraid that you won't like to hear that. It's that thing that we had done together before! Oh, how I missed it!" As he saw that Shi Qingzhuang had smiled, Qing Shui knew that she would not be angry.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Truly, Shi Qingzhuang only threw a reproachful sideward glance towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, I'm actually very, very worried!" Shi Qingzhuang followed Qing Shui back to the house.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What are you worried about?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui asked, but did not receive a reply.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qingzhuang!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi smiled and walked over!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Aunty!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang smiled and walked towards Qing Yi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi took up Shi Qingzhuang's hand and said, "Qing Shui, you're back. Old Master Yu is here and is in the living room. Go take a look!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Alright!" Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and only headed to the hall after his mother's and Shi Qingzhuang's silhouettes had disappeared from his vision!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once he entered, Qing Shui saw that Yu Donghao was seated on an old-fashioned wooden armchair, with 3rd Uncle Qing Hu chatting harmoniously beside him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After they saw Qing Shui, Yu Donghao stood up, and looked at him with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Master Yu! It's been very long since we'd last met!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although it had been a while since they last met, they were not that awkward with each other. Before he left, Qing Shui had requested for Yu Donghao's help to keep a lookout for the Qing Clan and the latter had also agreed, and did so until only after Mingyue Gelou had ascended to Xiantian and surpassed him in terms of their abilities. He had felt that the Qing Clan could stand up for themselves. Even without Mingyue Gelou with just Qing Shui alone, who had a great future before him, it was sufficient.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One look at Yu Donghao and Qing Shui could tell that he had suffered from internal injuries, and it was quite serious. He knew that Li Long must have done that. However, Qing Shui felt that Yu Donghao should have felt thankful that the other party did not think of taking his life. Otherwise, it was just a piece of cake for one who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian to kill him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Haha, that's right, it's been awhile. Qing Shui, now you've made it big! It's truly worth celebrating!" After he saw Qing Shui, Yu Donghao's eyes flashed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">3rd Uncle Qing Hu was also brimming with smiles. The Qing Clan today was unlike before, and every one of them had a strong sense of superiority, all because of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and walked over, he reached out his hand and quickly slapped &nbsp;Yu Donghao's chest and stomach very quickly over tens of times. With the repeated slapping sounds, Yu Donghao's pale face started to turn red.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui withdrew his hands, it had turned slightly transparent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Master Yu, you will be able to recover fully after a few days' rest!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Thank you! It is really a supreme stroke of luck for this old man to have met you!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Yu Donghao said this, he still felt a slightly regretful that back then, he did not thicken up his skin to push Qing Shui and Yu He together. Now, there was no way that he could say that.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui were to be with his granddaughter now, in the future, the Yu Clan may also go through a tremendous change in the future. It was really a pity. One day, their affinity with the Qing Clan would eventually come to an end.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yu Donghao did not have much reason to drop by, but his intentions were very clear. He hoped that the Qing Clan and Yu Clan could continue to have a good relationship in all areas.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yu Donghao had even mentioned Yu He, and said that she was at Yu Clan. Subtly he said that she missed Qing Shui. However, he did not say much, nor did he request for anything.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He merely wished to see Qing Shui's attitude. For example, if Yu He still had a chance. The reason he had said these to Qing Shui was because he wanted to see if Qing Shui was still interested in his granddaughter. As for whether she still had a chance, it would all be left to fate.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yu Donghao had yet to give up on Qing Shui!</p>
