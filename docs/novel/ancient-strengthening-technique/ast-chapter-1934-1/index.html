In three years’ time, Qing Shui thought his body was strong enough and it was the perfect timing to refine the Immortal Dao Divine Origin now. Hence, Qing Shui decided to start the refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man suggested Qing Shui to find a quiet place free from disturbance, but Qing Shui was not afraid. The Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was absolutely safe. Besides, there was a formation in the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Although Qing Shui’s close friends and women did not know about formation, they could move freely in the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not worried, he focused on revolving the energy in his body, then he raised his hand slowly!</span></p>

Next, he reached over to the jade box. The next second, his hand was surrounded by a semi-liquid and vapor-like object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a deep breath, grasping with his fingers bent.</span></p>

At this moment, Qing Shui felt a massive energy rushing into his body. That was an unyielding energy, it drifted within the meridians rapidly. A burning pain stimulated Qing Shui’s brain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Immortal Dao Divine Origin entered his body, Qing Shui realized it flowed within his meridians unorderly instead of being dispersed. He could sense his body absorbing it continuously as his energy strengthened incessantly. However, he felt the meridians being damaged due to the overbearing Immortal Dao Divine Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Royal’s Qi pellet, Yin-Yang Image, Divinity Spirit, even the Central Palace Blood Essence Pool and the Divine Nebula Formation of the Consciousness Ocean were constantly absorbing this energy and intensifying ceaselessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time ticked by, Qing Shui crossed his legs and sat in silence. His face was pale and his body was slightly trembling most of the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, a week was over!</span></p>

On top of that, tiny vessels-like objects were seen bulging on the skin as if they were ready to burst at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was depressed. It had been three years, three years of preparation and he was out of words now. In short, he was experiencing extreme torture and in essentially great danger now. Qing Shui did not mind about torment any longer since he endured so much after all these years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was concerned that he would explode and die, he would die in deep agony then. Things like this happened every day. Out of greed, the wages of avarice was death, that was a norm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Qing Shui was strong enough. Not only was his resistance strong, but his resilience also. Otherwise, he would have exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He dared not to be distracted at all. The Ancient Strengthening Technique kept revolving.</span></p>

The Ninth Heavenly Layer could be the greatest and top-ranked realm, but that was because nobody had ever broken through the realm of Ninth Heavenly Layer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Breaking the Shackles Realm!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A precise and pure energy melted in Qing Shui’s body and transformed into his own energy to resist the domineering Immortal Dao Divine Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The energy rose inversely with the force, Qing Shui began to see a bigger hope now. Initially, Qing Shui worried that he was unable to withstand it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from that, Qing Shui had a very strong healing power. There was no one around, or else, that person would be surprised by Qing Shui now. Fresh blood kept oozing out from the wounds on Qing Shui’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another week passed, one-fifth of the Immortal Dao Divine Origin in the body had faded and Qing Shui felt his strength increase tremendously. Although his body was already numb and unable to feel any pain, his meridians were constantly in a highly hazardous state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was hazardous to the extent of breaking meridians at any time, he was certain that he would be fine with his high resilience. Calming his mind, he operated his Force of Rebirth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Force of Rebirth merged into the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and flowed in his body. This immediately made things better for those meridians that were previously in danger. While achieving higher resilience, it healed some damaged areas too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked up to this Force of Rebirth all the times. He got ruined before and recovered with the aid of the Force of Rebirth. As long as Qing Shui was still alive, he could rely on the great Force of Rebirth to recuperate. However, the time required was uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two weeks, three weeks……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two months later, Qing Shui opened his eyes and stretched his body. A loud, cracking sound was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, it was fully absorbed and his entire body was safe now. Looking at his clothes, it was completely blood-stained and dried. It appeared to be a striking red outfit now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui frowned, he removed his clothes hurriedly. After a shower, he changed into fresh and clean clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two weeks’ time in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal equaled half a day in the outside world, hence Qing Shui was not in a rush to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Immortal Dao Divine Origin allowed Qing Shui’s strength to attain another immense boost. Through absorption, Qing Shui discovered that it was a blood-fighting Immortal Dao Divine Origin which was stronger in its attacking power. Thus, Qing Shui obtained an enormous rise in attacking power while his defense power only increased slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui tried to feel his current strength, his attacking power was around 200 million Dao Force and his total defense power was 300 million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In short, Qing Shui absorbed the Immortal Dao Divine Origin and it transformed into 100 million Dao pure defense power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these while, Qing Shui’s attacking power was inadequate. This time, the Immortal Dao Divine Origin complemented the shortage completely. Previously, Qing Shui’s attacking power was only one-tenth of his current one, this transformation was earthshaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">200 million Dao Force might not be a lot for others. Those days, the Barbarian Emperor might have similar attacking power, the Old Ancestor and the two old men beside him could have it too. It was only Qing Shui’s assumption, but it would not differ much in the reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with the 200 million Dao Force, Qing Shui had outshined the others. Putting aside the great Paragon Strike which was absolutely a destructive attack, even simply Qing Shui’s Nine Continent’s Mountain was unbearable. The Barbarian Emperor and the Old Ancestor of the Great Confucian Empire would be hard pressed to endure it.</span></p>
