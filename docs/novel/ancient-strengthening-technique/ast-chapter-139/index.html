 <p><strong>Chapter 139 The Third Level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0139 – The Third Level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal</strong></p>
  <p>The youth left, and told Qing Shui that his name was Lai Chusong, and that he was from the Lai Clan from Chu Jiang Country.</p>
  <p>The Cang Lang Country was already so big, but Qing Shui still had his goal, which was to leave his footprints all across the nine continents.</p>
  <p>The Lai Clan of the Chu Jiang Country was a very reputable clan. Qing Shui was very happy, with more friends, there were more options. Previously, if he had not met a strong expert like Baili Jingwei, the consequences would have been dire.</p>
  <p>Recalling the appreciative glance of Lai Chusong before he left, Qing Shui was very touched. What an upright and appreciative person!</p>
  <p>After sending off Lai Chusong, Qing Shui locked the doors to the Martial Clinic and took out the box with the two 1,000 year medicinal herbs. “Haha, I can finally refine the Small Revitalizing Pellet and the Five Dragon Pellet!”</p>
  <p>Merely thinking about this got Qing Shui excited, but there were other things which he needed to prepare first. Because he had not been able to get his hands on the thousand year old medicinal herbs, Qing Shui had not looked for the other ingredients. Searching for the rest of the ingredients may take him an additional 3-5 days.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal with the two boxes, preparing to store them there. However, upon entering, he was left dumbstruck!</p>
  <p>“Upgraded? The third level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal?” Qing Shui saw that the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had expanded by quite a lot. He estimated that the length and breadth had each increased by over 40 meters. It was now about 180 meters long, and about the size of 50 mu* of land.</p>
  <p>*(ED): 50 mu is roughly equal to 33,000 square meters, or 8 acres.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was of course very happy. He had just gotten his hands on two 1,000 year old medicinal herbs, and now the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had been upgraded as well. No wonder people always said that good things come in pairs. It was really exciting.</p>
  <p>The pool in the middle which had originally been 20 meters wide had increased to a little over 30 meters wide, with a depth of 20 meters. The big school of black fish and turtles swam happily in it, occasionally fighting against each other, and chasing after each other.</p>
  <p>“I can increase the amount of black fish and turtles now. Hmmm, how come there’s a golden turtle? Qing Shui was enjoying the view of the expanded pool when suddenly, he saw a gleaming golden turtle which was the size of an adult head swimming about in the pool and was seemingly divine.”</p>
  <p>It was like the lord of the pool, and no matter where it went, both the turtles and the black fish would open a path for it. Qing Shui stared at it in amazement. Where had that turtle come from?</p>
  <p>“Mmm, how could I have forgotten? What is the reward for leveling up to the 3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal?” Qing Shui suddenly felt very agitated as he ran towards the inscription steele opposite the pool.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui directly looked towards the description of the 3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p>3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal activated: Automatic addition of a Defense-Enhancing Fruit Tree which ripens once every 100 years, bearing 10 fruits each time. Each fruit can increase one’s defense by 500 jin. Each person can consume a maximum of two, any additional consumption would carry no benefits, but they can also be used for alchemy!</p>
  <p>Rewarded with a 5000 Year Old Golden Medicinal Turtle. Can extract a suitable amount of blood for the purpose of alchemy, thereby replacing the ingredient required from any normal demonic beast.</p>
  <p>It was really the reward from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui was astonished. “Damn it, this small thing has lived for 5000 years? Why does it seem like everything is linked to alchemy? But, I like it.”</p>
  <p>He did not expect that reaching the 3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would reward him with a small animal, moreover, one that was 5000 years old. If it was some other creature with such a lifespan, then it probably would have been a strong demonic monster.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, there’s still other rewards?”</p>
  <p>Drunken Fragrance Tree, ripens every ten years, each batch producing 100 Drunken Fragrance Fruits. Can be used for cooking, creating of condiments…the taste can be considered unparalleled. One fruit was sufficient per use!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the little tree which was a little over a meter tall, with a hundred fruits which were violet in color, the size of walnuts, and emitted a drowning fragrance. “Just the name alone tells me that the effects will definitely be good. Haha, I’ll be able to enjoy good food in the future.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui plucked down the Defense-Enhancing Fruits and the Drunken Fragrance Fruits. He would try out the good stuff first for himself. Qing Shui quickly swallowed two of the Defense-Enhancing Fruits. This fruit increased one’s defense, and compared to the Strength-Enhancing Fruit, he would prefer this. After all, a slight increase in power was nothing to someone at Qing Shui’s level.</p>
  <p>But, the Defense-Enhancing Fruit felt inferior compared to the Agility-Enhancing Fruit. Rather than keep accepting blows, he might as well escape. Moreover, having speed was equivalent to having power. Speed was the only technique in the world which could not be defeated!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw that the Strength-Enhancing Fruit Tree and Agility-Enhancing Fruit Tree had grown another 10 fruits per tree which would mature soon. To think that it had almost been one year already.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui exclaimed that time passed so quickly, and that so many things had happened ever since he came to Hundred Miles City. He had even broken through to the level of Xiantian in less than half a year’s time, but of course, Qing Shui could only make this comparison with his 4th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui unknowingly recalled Shi Qingzhuang, and eventually Mingyue Gelou, and then he was stunned!</p>
  <p>“Yin-Yang Pendant? Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal? Why was it that both levelled up after enjoying the pleasures of women? The other time, after the unplanned event where I had sex with Shi Qingzhuang, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal upgraded to the 2nd level. This time, it was after the lingering with Mingyue Gelou.” Qing Shui stood there, staring in disbelief.</p>
  <p>“What a lewd pendant, no wonder it is called the Yin-Yang Pendant. Could it be that it requires the merging of Yin and Yang energy to level up?” Qing Shui did not know whether to be happy or sad!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had looked forward to raising the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to the 9th level. The rewards would definitely be very good. At the 3rd level, other than the Defense-Enhancing Fruit Tree, there was also a 5000 Year Old Golden Medicinal Turtle, and the Drunken Fragrance Tree as a reward. If he were to reach the 9th level…!</p>
  <p>With the Strength-Enhancing Fruit, Agility-Enhancing Fruit, and now the Defense-Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui knew that there would eventually be Vitality-Enhancing Fruit and Spirit-Enhancing Fruit as well, and he could pretty much guess what their effects would be. The Vitality-Enhancing Fruit would probably grant a small increase in lifespan, while the Spirit-Enhancing Fruit would probably increase one’s mental energy.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked forward to more rewards such as the Golden Medicinal Turtle and the Drunken Fragrance Tree, since these were the unexpected ones. Ever since the Strength-Enhancing Fruit first appeared, Qing Shui had expected that the other four types would appear as well. What he did not expect was that there were also rewards such as the Golden Medicinal Turtle, as well as the Drunken Fragrance Tree.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not feel anything after eating the Defense-Enhancing Fruit, only a slightly bloated feeling for his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. He felt that the circulation of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique had become faster.</p>
  <p>Looking at the remaining Defense-Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui felt that it was too little. There were barely enough for those around him, let alone to use them for alchemy.</p>
  <p>Leaving the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui saw that only a little time had passed. He headed out, feeling exceptionally refreshed. While walking on the streets of the Hundred Miles City, he had a special feeling. One of confidence, of courage, and even one that made those around him seem small and insignificant.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that this was the result of raising his abilities. Now, within Hundred Miles City, his name had become well-known to the point that it had also passed on to the neighboring cities. It was the existence of the youngest Xiantian cultivator ever, a genius who could only appear in influential families who had gone through many years of history.</p>
  <p>The case of Shi Qingzhuang was something which had always made Qing Shui feel very awkward. He felt like snatching by force!</p>
  <p>“Now that I have both money and ability, why don’t I just be arrogant for once, overbearing for once? To be spending so much time thinking of a solution for something which can be solved by power when I have the power required, isn’t it very foolish?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head as he headed for Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store.</p>
  <p>“How come you know how to keep your eyes on the road this time. I thought you’d knock into me again.” The crisp and cute voice mumbled.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly at Xiang Bao. He seldom came out onto the street, but almost every time he did, he had to bump into this loli every time. Thank goodness he did not knock into her this time.</p>
  <p>“Young lady, why are you always following me around?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Who is stalking you, you narcissist!” Xiang Bao rolled her eyes, her exquisite little face was very cute.</p>
  <p>“Then why is it that I bump into you every time I come out?” Qing Shui gave up the path and passed by.</p>
  <p>“Hey hey, how could you be like this. Every time, you think of throwing me aside, am I that detestable?” Xiang Bao’s voice had a tinge of sob.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui turned his head and looked at Xiang Bao. An 18 year old girl was a flower no matter where she went, moreover, Xiang Bao was well-known for her beauty in Hundred Miles City, prettier than the big breasted Xiang Yuan who had a childish face. Of course, this would exclude the opinions of those with special preferences.</p>
  <p>“One can’t hide from what that’s bound to come.” Qing Shui sighed to himself. He really didn’t like spending his time with a little girl. He just didn’t like such immature girls.</p>
  <p>Xiang Bao saw that Qing Shui was silent, and tears fell from her eyes uncontrollably. She thought of the 1st time, 2nd time, and now this time. Each time he had left without any hesitation, viewing her as trouble and he wasn’t even willing to talk to her. Her heart ached, and tears fell from her face which was like an exquisite piece of white jade, as if they were like a chain of pearls which had broke.</p>
  <p>“Why do you have to act like this. It’s like I’ve bullied you!” Qing Shui was speechless.</p>
  <p>“What do you want? Making others think that I’ve bullied you.” Qing Shui came back helplessly.</p>
  <p>“You did bully me!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui: “…”</p>
  <p>“Why is it that every time you see me, you want to escape. Am I so detestable to you?” Xiang Bao said bitterly, her pair of beautiful eyes had turned red.</p>
  <p>“Isn’t it because I have things to attend to? Moreover, it’s not like we are very close.” Qing Shui was a bit displeased seeing the crying and complaining Xiang Bao. He really did not like such girls.</p>
  <p>“You’re lying. Why do you always have to treat me like this? I also have the right to pursue my happiness. How could you just close the doors on me like this.” Xiang Bao wiped her tears and said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>“Sigh, I only want you to give up quickly, and not waste time unnecessarily on me.” Qing Shui sighed and said solemnly.</p>
  <p>“But I’m willing to, I’m willing to do this. Even if I know of the outcome, I would still do this without hesitation. I don’t regret this. I just want to account to myself.” Xiang Bao’s misty eyes reflected determination as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Since you are happy doing this, I won’t stop you. Don’t disturb my regular life. Also, I already have someone that I like. Most importantly, you are just not my type.”</p>
  <p>It was better not to prolong the agony. So that Xiang Bao would not feel worse in the future, Qing Shui decided to cut off her thoughts when she has yet to latch onto them too deeply. His own life was already a mess as it was.</p>
  <p>Indecisiveness invariably leads to trouble! Qing Shui knew full well of this principle. He left the Xiang Bao who was in a daze as he turned to leave.</p>
  <p>Xiang Bao looked towards the gradually disappearing figure, and tears once again streaked down her face. Standing in the middle of the streets, she appeared so helpless, so pitiful!</p>

 <p>It was really the reward from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui was astonished. “Damn it, this small thing has lived for 5000 years? Why does it seem like everything is linked to alchemy? But, I like it.”</p>
 <p>He did not expect that reaching the 3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would reward him with a small animal, moreover, one that was 5000 years old. If it was some other creature with such a lifespan, then it probably would have been a strong demonic monster.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, there’s still other rewards?”</p>
 <p>Drunken Fragrance Tree, ripens every ten years, each batch producing 100 Drunken Fragrance Fruits. Can be used for cooking, creating of condiments…the taste can be considered unparalleled. One fruit was sufficient per use!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the little tree which was a little over a meter tall, with a hundred fruits which were violet in color, the size of walnuts, and emitted a drowning fragrance. “Just the name alone tells me that the effects will definitely be good. Haha, I’ll be able to enjoy good food in the future.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui plucked down the Defense-Enhancing Fruits and the Drunken Fragrance Fruits. He would try out the good stuff first for himself. Qing Shui quickly swallowed two of the Defense-Enhancing Fruits. This fruit increased one’s defense, and compared to the Strength-Enhancing Fruit, he would prefer this. After all, a slight increase in power was nothing to someone at Qing Shui’s level.</p>
 <p>But, the Defense-Enhancing Fruit felt inferior compared to the Agility-Enhancing Fruit. Rather than keep accepting blows, he might as well escape. Moreover, having speed was equivalent to having power. Speed was the only technique in the world which could not be defeated!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that the Strength-Enhancing Fruit Tree and Agility-Enhancing Fruit Tree had grown another 10 fruits per tree which would mature soon. To think that it had almost been one year already.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui exclaimed that time passed so quickly, and that so many things had happened ever since he came to Hundred Miles City. He had even broken through to the level of Xiantian in less than half a year’s time, but of course, Qing Shui could only make this comparison with his 4th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui unknowingly recalled Shi Qingzhuang, and eventually Mingyue Gelou, and then he was stunned!</p>
 <p>“Yin-Yang Pendant? Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal? Why was it that both levelled up after enjoying the pleasures of women? The other time, after the unplanned event where I had sex with Shi Qingzhuang, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal upgraded to the 2nd level. This time, it was after the lingering with Mingyue Gelou.” Qing Shui stood there, staring in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“What a lewd pendant, no wonder it is called the Yin-Yang Pendant. Could it be that it requires the merging of Yin and Yang energy to level up?” Qing Shui did not know whether to be happy or sad!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had looked forward to raising the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to the 9th level. The rewards would definitely be very good. At the 3rd level, other than the Defense-Enhancing Fruit Tree, there was also a 5000 Year Old Golden Medicinal Turtle, and the Drunken Fragrance Tree as a reward. If he were to reach the 9th level…!</p>
 <p>With the Strength-Enhancing Fruit, Agility-Enhancing Fruit, and now the Defense-Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui knew that there would eventually be Vitality-Enhancing Fruit and Spirit-Enhancing Fruit as well, and he could pretty much guess what their effects would be. The Vitality-Enhancing Fruit would probably grant a small increase in lifespan, while the Spirit-Enhancing Fruit would probably increase one’s mental energy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked forward to more rewards such as the Golden Medicinal Turtle and the Drunken Fragrance Tree, since these were the unexpected ones. Ever since the Strength-Enhancing Fruit first appeared, Qing Shui had expected that the other four types would appear as well. What he did not expect was that there were also rewards such as the Golden Medicinal Turtle, as well as the Drunken Fragrance Tree.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not feel anything after eating the Defense-Enhancing Fruit, only a slightly bloated feeling for his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. He felt that the circulation of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique had become faster.</p>
 <p>Looking at the remaining Defense-Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui felt that it was too little. There were barely enough for those around him, let alone to use them for alchemy.</p>
 <p>Leaving the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui saw that only a little time had passed. He headed out, feeling exceptionally refreshed. While walking on the streets of the Hundred Miles City, he had a special feeling. One of confidence, of courage, and even one that made those around him seem small and insignificant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this was the result of raising his abilities. Now, within Hundred Miles City, his name had become well-known to the point that it had also passed on to the neighboring cities. It was the existence of the youngest Xiantian cultivator ever, a genius who could only appear in influential families who had gone through many years of history.</p>
 <p>The case of Shi Qingzhuang was something which had always made Qing Shui feel very awkward. He felt like snatching by force!</p>
 <p>“Now that I have both money and ability, why don’t I just be arrogant for once, overbearing for once? To be spending so much time thinking of a solution for something which can be solved by power when I have the power required, isn’t it very foolish?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head as he headed for Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store.</p>
 <p>“How come you know how to keep your eyes on the road this time. I thought you’d knock into me again.” The crisp and cute voice mumbled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly at Xiang Bao. He seldom came out onto the street, but almost every time he did, he had to bump into this loli every time. Thank goodness he did not knock into her this time.</p>
 <p>“Young lady, why are you always following me around?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Who is stalking you, you narcissist!” Xiang Bao rolled her eyes, her exquisite little face was very cute.</p>
 <p>“Then why is it that I bump into you every time I come out?” Qing Shui gave up the path and passed by.</p>
 <p>“Hey hey, how could you be like this. Every time, you think of throwing me aside, am I that detestable?” Xiang Bao’s voice had a tinge of sob.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned his head and looked at Xiang Bao. An 18 year old girl was a flower no matter where she went, moreover, Xiang Bao was well-known for her beauty in Hundred Miles City, prettier than the big breasted Xiang Yuan who had a childish face. Of course, this would exclude the opinions of those with special preferences.</p>
 <p>“One can’t hide from what that’s bound to come.” Qing Shui sighed to himself. He really didn’t like spending his time with a little girl. He just didn’t like such immature girls.</p>
 <p>Xiang Bao saw that Qing Shui was silent, and tears fell from her eyes uncontrollably. She thought of the 1st time, 2nd time, and now this time. Each time he had left without any hesitation, viewing her as trouble and he wasn’t even willing to talk to her. Her heart ached, and tears fell from her face which was like an exquisite piece of white jade, as if they were like a chain of pearls which had broke.</p>
 <p>“Why do you have to act like this. It’s like I’ve bullied you!” Qing Shui was speechless.</p>
 <p>“What do you want? Making others think that I’ve bullied you.” Qing Shui came back helplessly.</p>
 <p>“You did bully me!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui: “…”</p>
 <p>“Why is it that every time you see me, you want to escape. Am I so detestable to you?” Xiang Bao said bitterly, her pair of beautiful eyes had turned red.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it because I have things to attend to? Moreover, it’s not like we are very close.” Qing Shui was a bit displeased seeing the crying and complaining Xiang Bao. He really did not like such girls.</p>
 <p>“You’re lying. Why do you always have to treat me like this? I also have the right to pursue my happiness. How could you just close the doors on me like this.” Xiang Bao wiped her tears and said in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, I only want you to give up quickly, and not waste time unnecessarily on me.” Qing Shui sighed and said solemnly.</p>
 <p>“But I’m willing to, I’m willing to do this. Even if I know of the outcome, I would still do this without hesitation. I don’t regret this. I just want to account to myself.” Xiang Bao’s misty eyes reflected determination as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Since you are happy doing this, I won’t stop you. Don’t disturb my regular life. Also, I already have someone that I like. Most importantly, you are just not my type.”</p>
 <p>It was better not to prolong the agony. So that Xiang Bao would not feel worse in the future, Qing Shui decided to cut off her thoughts when she has yet to latch onto them too deeply. His own life was already a mess as it was.</p>
 <p>Indecisiveness invariably leads to trouble! Qing Shui knew full well of this principle. He left the Xiang Bao who was in a daze as he turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Xiang Bao looked towards the gradually disappearing figure, and tears once again streaked down her face. Standing in the middle of the streets, she appeared so helpless, so pitiful!</p>
