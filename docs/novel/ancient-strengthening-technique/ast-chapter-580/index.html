 <p><strong><strong>580 - Luan Luan and Yuchang taken away, Four Seas Country vying for the Greencloud Continent (3)</strong></strong></p>
 <p>The old man’s decision made many people feel incredulous. Qing Shui’s words could be considered overbearing and aggressive, but the old man did not go and crush this young man to bits. Instead he released the two girls they had captured earlier.</p>
 <p>Zhan Yuan muddle-headedly left. In Qing Shui’s eyes, there was nothing wrong with the old man’s decision. If it were him, he would do the same thing.</p>
 <p>“I am here already, let us just speak openly, there is nothing wrong in wanting to vie for the Greencloud Continent. If there is anything wrong, it would be that you tried to use underhanded means to achieve this.” Qing Shui looked at the reserved face of the old man.</p>
 <p>Maybe because he felt that Qing Shui was not ordinary, the old man frowned and said “Since you said this, let’s speak openly, I want to vie for the Greencloud Continent, but that position has been taken by you. Thus, how about we have a battle and not involve our families.” The old man looked at Qing Shui and said slowly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed coldly in his heart. He asked himself if it could be done, but he did not believe the old man across him. He did not seem like an resolute man. Most importantly was that fat youth who called him grandfather, his blood and Qi seemed unstable. It was obvious that he had indulged too much in women and alcohol. If it were not for medicinal pills, he probably would have died at the hands of a woman long ago.</p>
 <p>There were also other youths and middle-aged men, most of them had obviously overindulged in women and alcohol. Those who had some strength were fine, at least they had maintained their cultivation.</p>
 <p>As for that fat youth, Qing Shui did not intend for him to live beyond today.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I can promise you that I won’t kill the innocents. If anything happens to me, I ask that you will honor your promise and let them go safely. I won’t ask for anything more.” Qing Shui did not expect them to honor their promise, but he still had to say these words.</p>
 <p>“Very well, I also hope that you will be able to bring them away safely.”</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>The two young girls ran over when they saw Qing Shui. However, at this moment the old man caught hold of Luan Luan and Yuchang and yelled “Zhan Yuan, get them all to withdraw!”</p>
 <p>“Father. mother!”</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan, Yuchang!” Yiye Jiange could not help but tear up and wanted to run over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui caught hold of Yiye Jiange, this was the first time he saw Yiye Jiange crying. He felt a pain in his heart and hurriedly said: “I’m still here, calm down, nothing will happen.”</p>
 <p>Finally, only the three Martial Saints and the old men remained behind. Of which there were less than a hundred remaining. Some of them could not help but lower their heads.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, since you dared to come, then you must be confident in your battle prowess. My biggest weakness is that I don’t like to take risks and like to use underhanded means. It does not matter what kind of means they are, as long as I can achieve my goals, they are good. I have seen the affection between you and the two girls, I wonder if I can use them as hostages to restrain you.” The old man laughed and looked at Qing Shui, his face had the gleeful look of a person getting away with an evil scheme.</p>
 <p>The old man’s earlier words were to test the relationship between Qing Shui and the two girls because him holding on to the two girls was not enough to threaten Qing Shui. The hearts of people who could reach this level were resolute. Only when the two girls appeared, did the old man knew that this plan would be effective.</p>
 <p>“Father, don’t bother about us, just kill him. Or else, if anything happens to father, we will not be fine either.” Luan Luan quickly shouted to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Haha this young lass is clever and quick-witted, what a pity she is not from my Zhan Clan. What you say counts for nothing.”</p>
 <p>“Your plot is indeed effective, what a pity that it is a plan that is used by people with no balls. Just say it, under what conditions will you release my two daughters.” Qing Shui laughed coldly, but his brains were working furiously.</p>
 <p>“I do not want to be too demanding, just come forward and let them give you a strike together. You are not allowed to defend or counterattack. After that, I will release your two daughters.” The old man said in an unhurried manner.</p>
 <p>“I wonder how reliable your words are, you are really quite cowardly, are you truly not afraid that I would kill your entire Zhan Clan? Even on your deathbed, you want your Zhan Clan to be buried with you? Do you still have the face to meet your Zhan Clan ancestors? What would you say when you meet them?” Qing Shui said these righteous words to fetter the old man’s heart, at his age, this was the matter that they feared the most.</p>
 <p>The old man’s expression changed, then resolutely looked at Qing Shui. “I don’t care about that, do you want to see which of your two daughters will be crippled first?”</p>
 <p>The old man held up the two young girls by the neck, Qing Shui felt a pain in his heart, he was not even able to conceal it. If Yiye Jiange was not held back by Qing Shui, she would have rushed over long ago.</p>
 <p>“Very well, I promise you. However, I hope you will honor your promise. I hope you will not make things difficult for them.” Qing Shui said without a choice.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don’t, you will die...” Yiye Jiange now pulled at Qing Shui and shook her head, the staunch woman could no longer control her tears.</p>
 <p>“I said before, I would not let anyone bully any of you unless I’m dead. Although I know this is not the best method, I do not want to see you suffer, you cannot do without Luan Luan……”</p>
 <p>“But I cannot do without you Qing Shui, you are as important as Luan Luan to me…” At this point, maybe she revealed her true feelings, she would not care about how ambiguous her words were.</p>
 <p>“Listen to me this time, in the future I will listen to everything you say!”</p>
 <p>“If anything happens to you today, I will accompany you forever. Why do you always make others owe you……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly walked to the front, the two old men beside that old man were already standing not far away waiting for Qing Shui. Qing Shui looked at the Old Man: “I hope you do not make things difficult for them.”</p>
 <p>“Do it!”</p>
 <p>Two fists struck towards Qing Shui’s chest at the same time, one right, one left. There was a black shadow appearing in the sky, this was the strength of two Martial Saints, Qing Shui submitted to fate and closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to be submitting to fate, but in his heart, he expanded his Spiritual Sense. It was a pity that he could not retaliate, or else Qing Shui was confident that he could kill them with a wave of a hand.</p>
 <p>How can one not bow to the circumstances?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never thought that one day he would be threatened by someone, under threats that rendered him helpless. He could meet with a contrived situation, furthermore, he was helpless in the face of crisis.</p>
 <p>When he really met such a situation, even though he knew it was wrong, he still had to do it. Just like those situations where he still had to persevere even though he was wrong. It might be rash, but even so, he had to do it.</p>
 <p>Minute Subtlety!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Minute Subtlety without making any movement or sound!</p>
 <p>“Bang Bang!”</p>
 <p>“Ka Ka!”</p>
 <p>“Pu!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and fell back. The fresh blood was expelled violently, scattering far away. His face was pale, His chest was sunken in, but he still stared closely intentlyat the old man.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui…”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange could no longer resist it and ran over, hugging Qing Shui, her tears flowing down her delicate face.</p>
 <p>“Cough cough, don’t cry, I’m still not dead yet!” Qing Shui coughed out another mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
 <p>“If you are a man, then let me hug my two daughters. Surely you are not afraid of a dying man?” Qing Shui weakly said to the old man, anyone could see that he was on the verge of death.</p>
 <p>Only Qing Shui knew that when he was injured earlier, the "Rebirth" that he once cultivated appeared once again. In addition to the Minute Subtlety, Qing Shui managed to preserve his life.</p>
 <p>“Even if you are not injured what can you do, on account of your stupidity this old man has been moved by you, I shall grant you your wish.”</p>
 <p>“Father, father……”</p>
 <p>The two young girls cried till their face were tear stained and ran over to hug Qing Shui. Their faces were filled with a sorrowful expression.</p>
 <p>“Stop crying girls, father is fine!” After Qing Shui said that, he struggled to get up. He looked at the old man and laughed very loudly, he wiped the corner of his mouth but fresh blood leaked out again.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique circulated slowly, the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Rebirth, and the Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness continuously repaired the damage he suffered</p>
 <p>With that insanely strong defense, the miraculous realm of Minute Subtlety, and well as the most heaven-defying Qi of Rebirth. As long as he did not die in an instant, Qing Shui could always recover with time.</p>
 <p>Although he was in a helpless situation, he had confidence in the strength of his body. Not only that, he had the Diamond Gigantic Elephant as well. Even though Qing Shui was unable to make a move, he knew he could break free with the aid of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>“If I said I will kill you now, would you believe it?” Qing Shui looked at the old man, the words he said cause Qing Shui to feel sluggish, however, the old man just laughed.</p>
 <p>“Are you still able to?” The old man looked at Qing Shui in disdain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hands!</p>
 <p>“Ming!”</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird appeared behind him, giving out a loud bird cry. It flapped its huge wings and a hot air blew by, causing the cold winter air to feel warm.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! You want to rely on this bird to kill me?” The old man looked at the huge Fire Bird and laughed, he was not unlike a cat playing with a mouse.</p>
 <p>“Weng Weng……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hands and summoned a hundred Jade Emperor Bees, even the Jade Emperor Queen Bee was included among them. One peak Martial King Jade Emperor Bee was not frightening, but with a hundred, as long as they were not Martial Saints, they would feel their scalp go numb. The speed of the Jade Emperor Bee was fast, their sting had poison in them.</p>
 <p>This time, the old man had a minor change in his expression. However, it was not a big change: “Who knew that you are also a strong Beast Tamer. It’s a pity that your Demonic Beasts are trash, they will not be not able to save you.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not summon the Jade Emperor Bee to battle but to protect the two young girls. The hundred Jade Emperor Bees could hold off the peak Martial King old men behind them.</p>
 <p>“Really? Then how about this one?” as Qing Shui finished saying that, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant appeared directly in front of Qing Shui. It was Skywalking. With its huge body as well as the black flame that looked like black lotus flowers under its four feet it looked strange, mysterious, and strong.</p>
 <p>“Martial Saint leveled Demonic Beast!”</p>
 <p>“Martial Saint leveled……”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>In an instant, there were cries of shock. Qing Shui looked at the old man who was getting paler, he commanded the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to attack.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The strength of 600 countries bombarded out, a huge web like chasm spread out. In an instant, it caused all the buildings in the Hundred Clan War Barracks to collapse. The old man and the other two Martial Saint had fast reactions and quickly flew into the air.</p>
 <p>The biggest advantage of a Martial Saint was that they could fly!</p>
 <p>The three of them avoided it, but that did not mean that the people behind them could avoid it. A shower of blood rained down. There was no need to spare these people, or else Qing Shui would not have allowed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to use such as a strong area of effect skill.</p>
 <p>After breaking through, the body of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had the strength of 120 countries. The large success stage Mighty Elephant Stomp multiplied its strength by five folds and attacked the ground. That huge quake and tearing force was not something they could withstand.</p>
 <p>Although the force of 600 countries was mostly dispersed by the ground, and the land of the Hundred Clan War Barracks was flat. Even so, many of the weaker cultivators could not leap up in time and immediately got crushed.</p>
 <p>The other people were severely injured but had preserved their lives!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>The shadow of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant body moved in a flash to one of the weaker Martial Saints. It was so fast that the target was not able to evade.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A shower of blood scattered through the air. The Skywalking Diamond Gigantic Elephant was not unlike a blood-thirsty Demonic Beast, incredibly savage and violent!</p>
 <p>“Ding! Ding!”</p>
 <p>On the other side, two Sword Qi suddenly slashed at the huge body of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Its body had the strength of 120 countries, with the effects of Diamond Protection its defense reached a terrifying defense of 240 countries. They sorrowfully realized that they could not breach the defense of this Demonic Beast.</p>
 <p>This caused their mental state to hit rock bottom!</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui was thoroughly angered. If the old man had relied on his cultivation to battle, it did not matter if they bullied people like the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord did. However, he used such underhanded plots, from that moment Qing Shui did not intend to leave him alive.</p>
 <p>“Elephant, hit him!” Yuchang held Qing Shui’s hands as she happily cried out.</p>
 <p>However, Luan Luan was held back by Yiye Jiange and Qing Shui, Qing Shui was afraid that she would rush to the front!</p>
 <p>Once again, there was another Instantaneous Diamond Evasion and Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness. With the speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant the other weaker Martial Saint did not even have the time to think of escaping. Not to mention when the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion was used.</p>
 <p>The huge strength caused another blood splatter. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant now left behind a black oppressive image in the air!</p>
 <p>“Regretting yet?” Qing Shui commanded the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to restrain the remaining old man and casually asked.</p>
 <p>The old man smiled bitterly: “I was not straightforward and upright but not despicable and vicious enough!”</p>
 <p>“It is not that you are not despicable enough, nor vicious enough. You were stupid and overconfident. Your long life was truly a tragedy, you were chased out but did not fight back. Instead, you vied for the Greencloud Continent. You said that the Greencloud Continent still had Martial Saints, do you think they would allow you to control the Greencloud Continent? Is your strength sufficient?” Qing Shui looked at the old man in disgust.</p>
 <p>“It is still hard to say who the winner will be, your Demonic Beast may have a strong defense, but its attack is lacking.” The old man held a heavy sword and stared at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>“Its attack is lacking? Then take a better look, if you can withstand its attack then it would not be too late to say that!”</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui said that, he commanded the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to attack. Likewise, it used the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion. However, at the moment of contact it used the strongest attack of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Diamond Attack!</p>
 <p>“Pu!”</p>
 <p>A gut wrenching sound resounded, facing absolute strength, nothing would be sufficient. When the old man’s body snapped like a twig, Qing Shui’s heart calmed down.</p>
 <p>Now, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was basically able to kill Grade 1 Martial Saint with one strike. It had excellent strength and speed, especially during the explosive attack of the Ferocious Diamond Attack. Even a peak Grade 2 Martial Saint would not treat it lightly. Any cultivator who could not dodge this attack, as long as they were below a Grade 2 Martial Saint in cultivation would immediately die. Even killing a Grade 2 Martial Saint was just a matter of time. The Diamond Gigantic still had the Vajra Subdues Demons, it weakens all the abilities of the opponent by 10 percent.</p>
