 <p><strong>AST 874 - Soulshake Bell, Subduing the Dragons, Taming the Tigers, Berserk Dragon King Appears</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui and their group were sufficient to defend the place, however their hearts were a mess, as no one knew how many Demonic Beasts were out there. When this kind of situation appears, it is very easy to attract stronger demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>This was the Sky Penetrating Mountains and it was not the least bit strange for strong demonic beasts to appear at any time. It could be considered unfortunate that they had met with Berserk Dragons. Although this demonic beast wasn’t like the Berserk Blood Bear that would fight and never retreat, they would not retreat until you killed enough to make them terrified.</p>
 <p>Roars shook the skies and coupled with the sharp screeches of the Vampiric Falcon Vulture, the entire area was extremely chaotic, making people flustered.</p>
 <p>The ground was littered with the corpses of many Vampiric Falcon Vulture and Berserk Dragons, however they were quickly devoured by the Vampiric Falcon Vultures. Regardless of whose corpses they were, as long as they saw blood, even those that were still living would be met with their attacks, sucking their blood until they died.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held a shield in one hand and the Thunder God in the other. From time to time the shield would smash open a gap between the incoming beasts or the Thunder God would instantaneously destroy a Berserk Dragon.</p>
 <p>He continuously dished out Raging Blows, which he had practiced within the Realm of the Violet Immortal, with his fists as a replacement for the hammer. Although he had later used the Thunder God to train, it wasn’t as enjoyable as now, as at least this was considered a real battle.</p>
 <p>He was getting more and more familiar with this practical combat skill and the resulting terrifying might of each hammer strike was enough for the lady beside him to shoot an astonished look at him. If not for the battle, she would definitely stare at him for a longer period of time. Furthermore, she seemed to feel that the hammer skill that he was unleashing definitely had some connection with the Raging Blow, as she could feel the rage building.</p>
 <p>What made the lady especially astonished was Qing Shui’s Shield Attack. The terrifying force of the shield bash seemed to be able to topple a mountain. Every single strike of it was able to smash numerous Berserk Dragons back and clear a huge empty space, with the smashed Berserk Dragon immediately exploding and dying. In addition there was Fire Bird in the air, terrifying flames continuously spewing from it. The Vampiric Falcon Vultures were immediately killed upon contact. This basically blocked the top part of the cave, preventing them from entering it.</p>
 <p>The geography here was good, similar to the sort where one man can hold the pass against all enemy forces. Otherwise Fire Bird would not be able to hold back such an enormous cast of Vampiric Falcon Vultures. However, after 15 minutes passed the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens state was going to dissipate. At that time the might of Hell’s Inferno would drop by half. Although it was still lethal against the Vampiric Falcon Vultures, it did not have any killing power towards the Berserk Dragons on the ground.</p>
 <p>15 minutes passed very quickly and in addition this intense combat has resulted in enormous energy consumption for the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hand speed slowed down for a moment as he looked at the endless beastial horde and the dense and numerous Vampiric Falcon Vultures in the sky.</p>
 <p>His mind was quickly thinking. Although the Vampiric Falcon Vultures were terrifying, their strength was comparatively quite low and could be easily killed. Furthermore, as long as they could run to the valley below, these things would not be anything to worry about.</p>
 <p>Therefore the main problem was these Berserk Dragons. Not only did they block the ground, their group could not just fly up and leave, as these Berserk Dragons were also able to fly. Although they could not fly for long, they were exceptionally quick in short distances. Therefore, once they go airborne, they would be engulfed by these demonic beasts. They were better off defending this place.</p>
 <p>While fighting, Qing Shui slowly inched towards the lady.</p>
 <p>“Do you have any other ideas? Could it be that we have to kill all them?” asked Qing Shui, while his hands did not stop.</p>
 <p>“Unless you slaughter their ‘King’, in most cases they will not retreat.” The lady also did not stop her attacks, however she did pan her head over to shoot a look at him.</p>
 <p>“Their ‘King’?” asked Qing Shui without turning around.</p>
 <p>“That’s the king among the Berserk Dragons. As long as you can kill it, they will retreat,” replied the lady softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant would unleash a Mighty Elephant Stomp from time to time. Within this kind of battle, the Vajra Subdues Demons was already useless. It continuously unleashed the Might Elephant Stomp, Diamond Sword Qi and Ferocious Diamond Attack</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable had it the easiest, as it relied on its speed to continuously massacre the surrounding Berserk Dragons. For now, Fire Bird was the only killing the Vampiric Falcon Vultures in the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui faintly wrinkled his brows, as he was unable to see the king of the Berserk Dragons. Without even trying he could guess that it was at the back of this horde. However, if he left this place, not only would he get attacked in the back, he would even get attacked from the sky. Qing Shui did not have the confidence to prevent this from happening.</p>
 <p>“Let’s try to agitate the king that is hidden behind these Berserk Dragons. We have to force it out, if not we’re truly finished,” muttered Qing Shui before clenching his teeth as he made his decision.</p>
 <p>Shield Attack, Shield Attack...</p>
 <p>Total Annihilation</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Mighty Elephant Stomp was stronger than that displayed by the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and the instantaneous eruption created a stretch of empty space. In the next moment, Qing Shui brought out the Soulshake bell and gave it a fierce shake towards the large wave of incoming Berserk Dragons.</p>
 <p>Its sound no better than wailing of ghosts and howling of wolves, however it did not have any effect to humans, although the sounds it produced were truly horrible to listen to. Fortunately it was still bearable, however it was a different story for demonic beasts, who were now in a miserable state.</p>
 <p>Instantly the entire battleground turned lively, as Qing Shui started to inject spirit energy into the Soulshake Bell.</p>
 <p>This caused everyone present to be completely shocked, as chaos erupted throughout the entire battleground. Of the demonic beasts, ten odd of them were immediately killed, while tens of them fled. The most important point was that roughly fifty that had turned hysterical and started attacking the Berserk Dragons besides them.</p>
 <p>Due to the special geography of this place, over fifty of them were enough to completely block this place. Although momentarily they had unexpectedly entered a deadlock, the Soulshake Bell had sent the Berserk Dragons into a hysterical state, leaving them unable to differentiate friend from foe. Due to the hysterical state, they disregarded any end result and just attacked. Therefore, momentarily their combat prowess had increased some and the group was in a deadlock.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately the hysterical Berserk Dragons could not recognize friend from foe. It wasn’t a mutiny, nor was it because they accepted the commands of Qing Shui. They were attacking everything near them, humans and demonic beasts alike.</p>
 <p>The lady looked at the pretty violet colored Soulshake Bell in Qing Shui’s hand. She was a beast tamer and knew what it was, however she had not imagined that there actually was such a thing.</p>
 <p>The ancient records had listed this as a nemesis to beast tamers, the Soulshake Bell. It was specially built to counter demonic beasts. Right now it truly was incomparably powerful. If a beast tamer only had a few demonic beasts, it was truly not enough to kill him...</p>
 <p>The Mu family people were also looking at Qing Shui dumbfound. However, they quickly regained their wits. Now, they had seemed to feel that compared to their miss, the monstrous existence of this youth seemed to not be much inferior.</p>
 <p>After refining the Soulshake Bell, filling it up with spirit energy require a bit of time, approximately an incense stick’s worth of time. Therefore for this moment Qing Shui was imbuing it while clutching the Thunder God, preparing to enter combat at any moment.</p>
 <p>The fifty hysterical Berserk Dragons were able to hold off for a while. Furthermore there were tens of them that had fled. This created a ripple in the enormous beastial horde, like a tidal wave.</p>
 <p>Very quickly those hysterical Berserk Dragons were killed and were eaten clean by the Vampiric Falcon Vultures in the air. Those who had fled had disappeared without a trace. At this moment Qing Shui’s Soulshake Bell was already fully charged and could be used again.</p>
 <p>Another shake.</p>
 <p>The previous occurrence appeared again in the battlefield. However, this time the results were even stronger than the previous time. The Soulshake Bell’s realm was already at the seventh level, the realm of vanquishing dragons and tigers.</p>
 <p>A level Seven Soulshake Bell was already strong and in addition it was quickly entering the eighth level. Qing Shui did not know how many levels could it be promoted to in this realm and in this world. The current might was considered pretty good but Qing Shui was anticipating the future.</p>
 <p>The Soulshake Bell was able to control no more than ten demonic beasts. It produces a terrifying sound that would frighten and shake the soul. There’s a 30% chance of causing the target to become flustered and flee. A 20% chance of turning hysterical, making it attack everything in its surroundings. A 10% chance of immediately causing death, regardless of the target’s level. A few special demonic beasts are able to reduce the efficacy of the Soulshake Bell.</p>
 <p>This percentage wasn’t considered high, however it was absolutely not low. Furthermore its greatest effect was to disregard the target’s level. Just that some special demonic beasts were able to lower these percentages.</p>
 <p>He had displayed it so many times in an instant, therefore the success rate was still quite low. This time, the result had approximately doubled when compared to before. Therefore there was quite a spectacle created in the battleground.</p>
 <p>Only now, after meeting with a strong beast horde did Qing Shui discover that the Spiritual Qi of the Soulshake Bell was insufficient. Due to its high realm, the Spiritual Qi consumed in every use was significant. Looks like he still needed to promote its realm.</p>
 <p>Time passed by bit by bit just like that. At this time, it was already close to midday. The battle was still continuing. It was already the tenth time that Qing Shui had used the Soulshake Bell.</p>
 <p>From the second time to the third time, there were still ten odd of hysterical Berserk Dragons left. After using the bell multiple times, the end result was pretty good, therefore after the last usage there were actually close to four hundred hysterical demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, a roar that pierced through the clouds suddenly resounded out from behind the beastial horde.</p>
 <p>Roar! Roar!</p>
 <p>Two consecutive roars followed and the Berserk Dragon group that was originally slightly hysterical immediately started to grow berserk again, charging towards the hysterical Berserk Dragons. Furthermore, after that roar, Qing Shui discovered that the combat prowess of the hysterical Berserk Dragons had declined. This was a sort of instinctive dread towards their king.</p>
 <p>This made the situation where they could defend with difficulty disintegrate instantaneously, as the Berserk Dragons were mutually killing themselves. Qing Shui looked over to the origin of the roar. He knew that these roars were made by the Berserk Dragon King, as only it had such capability.</p>
 <p>On a mountaintop far away, Qing Shui spotted the Berserk Dragon King’s figure.</p>
 <p>The scarlet red figure appeared more brightly colored than a normal Berserk Dragon, like an intense raging inferno. It was more than two times the size of a normal Berserk Dragon and was similar to that of an Earth Dragon Beast King. However, this Berserk Dragon King looked more violent. With a single look, Qing Shui could tell that it was very strong, as the imposing aura radiating from it could prove.</p>
 <p>There was still some distance from him but Qing Shui still prepared to rush towards it. However, he was held back, the soft feeling indicating that it was the lady beside him. Turning his head back, he looked at her, causing her to let go of his hand in a fluster.</p>
 <p>She had previously wanted to grab onto Qing Shui’s sleeve, however Qing Shui had wanted to rush over. With a move of his hand, it had resulted in her grabbing his hand...</p>
 <p>The lady’s heart beat very quickly. Releasing his hand, she shook her head while blushing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the lady. Never would he have imagined that her blushing appearance would cause even his heart to beat faster. This was an unspeakable allure and belong to a refined and absolutely beautiful woman like her.</p>
 <p>“We’ve already completely angered it. It’ll come here quickly. Don’t go, it’s dangerous,” said the lady softly.</p>
 <p>The lady’s mind was actually already in turmoil. She had already discovered it but what she discovered was not as intense as it actually was. This was the first time she felt such a sensation. She felt very confused and did not like such a feeling.</p>
