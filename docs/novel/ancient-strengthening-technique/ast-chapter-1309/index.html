 <p><strong>AST 1309 - Qing Shui’s Killing Intent, Open War, Here I come to Fight</strong></p>
 <p>The opponent’s speed was really fast. They came in overwhelming numbers. There were as much as three hundred huge demonic beasts. Basically, the mounts were all either Gold or Silver Lion King Eagles. Their bodies were the bodies of huge golden and silver eagle bodies whereas their heads were composed of gold and silver lion’s heads.</p>
 <p>Without much thought, Qing Shui was already able to figure out that the Gold Lion King Eagles were unique mounts owned by Beitang Clan. Beitang Clan was also a powerful beast taming clan. Naturally, the Silver Lion King Eagles were the mounts owned by the royal clan of Silver Lion King Dynasty.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui started to wonder if Beitang Clan had any blood relations with the royal clan in Silver Lion Dynasty. Qing Shui was also very curious why he would have such a weird thought.</p>
 <p>“Beitang Clan has once been connected by marriage with Silver Lion Dynasty. Hence now, within the body of the royal clan in Silver Lion Dynasty also flowed the blood of Beitang Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if he had figure things out through his own thought or it just so happened that he happened to just say it while he was thinking about it.</p>
 <p>There were around three hundred of them. Those large demonic beasts were enough to cover the earth and sky. That enormous pressure was directly approaching Qing Shui. The four demonic beasts taking the lead were two Gold Lion King Eagles and two Silver Lion KIng Eagles. They were almost twice the size of those normal ones.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui found the dressing of these people really interesting. The old man above the Gold Lion King Eagle was wearing a gold lion gown whereas similarly, the Silver Lion King Eagle wore a silver gown.</p>
 <p>“It has been three days. I wonder if you have gotten the things which I want ready?”</p>
 <p>The old man on one of the Gold Lion King Eagle said with a smile.</p>
 <p>The old man had a tall and straight figure. Even though his hair and beard was white, he didn’t give the others the slightest idea that he was a doddering old man. His skin was as smooth as babies. He had a healthy and hearty look. The forehead of his also looked plumped. With just one look, people could already deduce that he does not lack for riches.</p>
 <p>The only thing which made people felt awkward was that the eye lines of the old man were too long. Everytime when he opened or closed his eyes, the eye line which was revealed was like a sharp sword. Even if he was just smiling, he still carried along a cold killing intention.</p>
 <p>“Beitang Yigong, seeing that so many of you came, could it be that you guys are planning to take it by force?” Fa Ying looked at the old man who was on the lead and said calmly. He sounded really calm. The Buddha Sect cultivated one’s minds. Even when facing against powerful foes, they would still remain the same expression on their face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, analyzed each and every one of his opponents. After a thorough analysis only did he find out that he has underestimated Western Oxhe Continent. The reason being that two of the people from each of Beitang Clan and Silver King Dynasty actually had strength worth around eight thousand sun. Furthermore, it would be even stronger when they participated in actual battles with the possibility of reaching a strength which surpassed ten thousand sun.</p>
 <p>It seemed like they might have truly hidden their strength really well. With strength like this, it might have been able to squeeze into the list of fourth grade dynasties. The Heaven Secrets Academy was also holding back at least eight thousand sun worth of strength</p>
 <p>Actually, ever since Beitang Clan attained this level of strength, they had long since not see the Beitang Clan in the five continents as a thing. Even blood-related brothers would end up as strangers after generations. This was how aristocratic clans worked. When someone was capable, it wouldn’t matter no matter how many generations got passed on. They would still be a family. But if a clan had no strength, even blood-related brothers would lose contact over time.</p>
 <p>“Snatch it? As if Great Northern Dynasty will do something like this! We are exchanging. We have said before that we won’t lay hand on Great Qi Dynasty for three years. If we’re to conquer that dynasty, tell me, will that thing, in a way, belong to us too? This way, we are taking our own stuff back in exchange for three years for you guys to live. Is this term not good enough for you?” The old man looked at Fa Ying with a calm expression.</p>
 <p>“I have said before. I would rather destroy it than letting you have it.” Fa Ying said coldly.</p>
 <p>“A group of brain-dead people. Do you not care about the nations of Great Qi Dynasty? Do you really want to see them dying in front of you? By that time, they will all die because of you. How are you going to meet the buddha once you died?” The old man looked at Fa Ying with a faint smile. At this moment, his smile looked real like the edge of a sword.</p>
 <p>“The buddha has said before that killing is not the way to solving problems. We can’t kill out of fear of others. But even gods themselves also have their own knives. When necessary, they wouldn’t hesitate to wield their knives and slaughter the mortals. If needed, I won’t mind becoming such kind of god.” At this moment, the killing intentions around Fa Ying’s body has reached its peak.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Slaughter God? Unfortunately, you don’t have the strength to do that. I, Beitang Yizong, guarantee on behalf of the entire Beitang Clan that so long as you hand over the Buddha Stone, we will retreat right away. We also guarantee to not lay a hand on Great Qi Dynasty within these three years. After three years, if Great Qi Dynasty can dedicate their loyalty to the Great Northern Dynasty, I guarantee that I won’t touch even a single hair of Great Qi Dynasty.” Beitang Yizong let out a loud laugh.</p>
 <p>“I would rather die standing than live kneeling down to you..” Like usual, Fa Ying retained the same expression.</p>
 <p>“Since you want to die so badly, let me fulfill your wish. I am sure there will be people who don’t want to die in Great Golden Buddha Temple. I will only think about the rest after killing you.” Beitang Yigong was about to act as soon as he finished speaking.</p>
 <p>“Slow down, we are already here. What are you rushing for? It won’t be late for you to act a bit later. For certain things, it is better if we talk about it instead.” At this moment, Qing Shui stood out.</p>
 <p>“Young man, this isn’t the place for you to voice your opinion. Don’t try to interrupt us. If you insist on doing that, I will kill you.”An old man in silver lion gown from the other side said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved his sight towards the old man who was speaking. He looked rough, violent and even though he had white hair and beard, the skin across his face was like tree bark. He had a pair of huge round eyes and also hair which looked thick like iron needles. He looked just like a violent male lion.</p>
 <p>“If you keep on talking, do you believe that I will make you vanish totally along with Beitang Clan?” Qing Shui said with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>The old man kept on blinking his eyes. Right at the moment when he was about to talk, he got stopped by the old men nearby bim. At this moment. Beitong Ying settled down his sight at Qing Shu, “And here I am thinking who could be so arrogant. So it is you. My Beitang Clan was trying to look for you. Surprisingly, you turned up on you own. Today, I am killing you first before going to the five continents to eliminate your clan members.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui was still considering on how he should solve the problem with Beitang Clan. But now, everything has turned out well as he already had in mind what he should do. When a man kill, he should show no mercy.</p>
 <p>“For this sentence, this sentence of yours is going to cost you a price which will cause you to die with grievance.” Qing Shui looked at Beitang Yigong calmly.</p>
 <p>“Despite your young age, you are already so arrogant. Since that’s the case, let’s test out whose fists are harder. Indeed, I don’t have a choice if you are the one choosing to not walk the heaven’s path when it is open available for you. Who is planning to fight me now?”</p>
 <p>As Beitang Yigong was speaking, he took a step forward.</p>
 <p>“Brother, why don’t you let me fight first!” The old man beside Beitang Yigong took a step forward and said.</p>
 <p>Beitang Yigong responded after thinking for a while, “Well then, Yizong, I will let you take the lead. Today, let them know that it only takes one man from my Beitang Clan to eliminate all of them.”</p>
 <p>Beitang Yizong quickly stood in the middle of both parties. At the moment, he was currently standing above the air staring at the Great Golden Buddha Temple as well as Qing Shui. Even though he wasn’t speaking, things had already been made really obvious. Who was going to take the fight?</p>
 <p>Fa Ying was about to make his way forward when he was stopped by Qing Shui, “Master, are you confident you will win? Why don’t you let me fight this one.”</p>
 <p>“No I am not. But this is the first fight, I have to be the one to fight it even if it means myself dying.” Fa Ying said in a firm tone.</p>
 <p>Looking at Fa Ying’s attitude, Qing Shui was already knew that he could no longer stop him. He let out a sigh and said slowly, “Well then, stay cautious. As long as you are still breathing, I will have my own ways to save you.”</p>
 <p>Though saying this might sound a bit unpleasant, Qing Shui still felt the need to say it. He was scared that Fa Ying would fight with the mindset of thinking that his death was certain. That way, it would be hard for him to save him. Hence, he said it as a reminder to Fa Ying. He was sure that death was definitely something which Fa Ying was reluctant to face. But if it meant dying together with the old man opposite him, he wouldn’t hesitate to go for that option.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really admired the people who weren’t afraid of dying. The reason being that they took their belief which they had in their heart more important than their own life. It was for their inheritance, it was to fight for righteousness of their own.</p>
 <p>Fa Ying nodded, “I will. I still want to see if Great Golden Buddha Temple can make it through this crisis.” Fa Ying smiled at Qing Shui. He put his palms together and bowed down. As that happened, Qing Shui quickly stepped aside.</p>
 <p>“Master, rest assured, the Buddha Sect will only become more and more prosperous. You must stay alive and see for yourself.” Qing Shui sounded confident.</p>
 <p>Fa Ying’s weapon was a huge staff. It was gold in color and was three meters long. It was as thick as an adult’s arm. As soon as he moved his body, he was already in the middle, about thirty meters away from Beitang Yizong.</p>
 <p>For warriors like them, it would only take them an instant to travel this kind of distance.</p>
 <p>“Let’s get this over with. Don’t say that I am bullying you. I have already given you a choice to make. You are the one who is seeking death yourself. You can’t put the blame on others.” Beitang Yizong said very arrogantly. But in front of Fa Ying, he did have the capability to be arrogant.</p>
 <p>“Stop trying to find anymore excuses for yourself. Could it be that deep down, even you yourself also feel that the things you do are inappropriate and that you are just trying to find a way to forgive yourself?” Fa Ying said slowly. After that, he slowly swayed the staff in his hand with a strange energy. After that, he abruptly hopped up and swiftly made his way towards Beitang Yizong.</p>
 <p>A sweep crossing river, Vajra Buddha Devil Rod!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected for Fa Ying to actually use the Vajra Buddha Devil Rod. Furthermore, it was the Fourth Staff, Five Soaring Waves.</p>
 <p>The attack prowess of that rod was still considerably strong. It also possessed decent speed. With Fa Ying’s current strength, he has already drew out the maximum potential of the technique.</p>
 <p>Beitang Yizong maintained the same facial expression seeing the enormous staff dropping down. He swung his right hand and as he did that, a ray of enormous Origin Qi condensed into an enormous lion’s claws clashed against the rod.</p>
 <p>Burst!</p>
 <p>Beng!</p>
 <p>Beitang Yizong shouted out loudly. He continued to unleash his attacks with his lion’s claw. As he once again took a step forward and thrusted out his palm. Two even larger lion claws leaped out towards Fa Ying.</p>
 <p>In everywhere which it passed by, it would start two hurricanes in the air.</p>
 <p>Diamond Body!</p>
 <p>A golden light shone across Fa Ying’s body. He was holding the staff in his hands right in front of him. The lion’s claws from before had already pushed him back. This time, there were even two of them. Not only so, they seemed even stronger than the previous one.</p>
 <p>Their gap in strength was too large. There was no longer any suspense in the battle. Even if he has had the Diamond Body, such defensive martial technique was insufficient to help keep him from being perfectly undamaged.</p>
 <p>Beng-beng!</p>
 <p>Fa Ying held the staff in his hand tightly. Despite this, he still spurted out fresh blood from his mouth and got blown backwards. The two old monks quickly went ahead to catch him. They took out some recovery medicinal pills and let him took them. Qing Shui also took out the Gold Needles and quickly inserted thirty-six needles on Fa Ying’s chest.</p>
 <p>The part which Fa Ying was injured at was his organs. Even after his Diamond Body managed to block off a lot of attacks, he still got critically injured. But as long as he didn’t die, Qing Shui would have his ways to save him.</p>
 <p>“Great master, let me handle the rest of the battle. There has to be a day when Beitang Clan and I will have to settle things once and for all. Since I have already made it here in time, I might just do things more thoroughly.” Qing Shui said while trying to stabilize Fa Ying’s injuries.</p>
 <p>“Well then Mister Qing, sorry for the trouble.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved swiftly with his body and blocked Beitang Yizong who has already arrived at the Great Golden Buddha Temple.</p>
 <p>“Let me handle the rest of the matches. I will let you have the initiative to start first. Don’t tell me that I am bullying you. Or else, I am afraid you might not even have the chance to unleash a single attack.” Qing Shui was considered to have returned the words which Beitang Yizong said to Fa Ying back to Beitang Yizong himself.</p>
