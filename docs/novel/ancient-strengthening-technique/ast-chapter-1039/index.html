 <p><strong>AST 1039 - Meeting Yun Duan, Qing Yun</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood at a distance and gazed. He had interacted in the wrong manner with this woman. At first, he thought that she was a woman of loose morals and with her given beauty, he was not polite at all. At the same time, he wanted to aggravate the Feng Clan.</p>
 <p>What had been wrong was that she was, in fact, a virgin maiden. Although the both of them were estranged in the end, he never did forget her until they met again. In that moment, he then realized that he unknowingly had her in his heart. He could not deny that he possessed the desire to misbehave as he was her first man and he was not willing to let others get a share. Moreover, men would usually lust before being affectionate.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, as though she felt something, Yun Duan looked towards Qing Shui’s direction. She stared blankly while Qing Shui looked at her with a smile and Qing Shui then walked over to her.</p>
 <p>“Mother……”</p>
 <p>A young and melodious voice made Yun Duan, who was stunned, come back to her senses. She bent over and carried the little girl. At the same time, Qing Shui had already walked right before her and his gaze was fixed on the elegant woman, as well as the little girl</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, tell me this is not a dream and that this is real” Yun Duan looked at Qing Shui and said gently.</p>
 <p>“This is real!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and said while walking over to hug her, only to see that the little girl was crying. Hugging Yun Duan, she looked at Qing Shui with fear.</p>
 <p>“Naughty girl, you didn’t give face to me.” Qing Shui quickly released Yun Duan. He then looked at the little girl. Her eyes were so big that the white and black in her eyes were so defined that it looked as though they were pure crystals and her tender face made others adore her.</p>
 <p>“Yun Duan, it must have been tough on you. Only after our daughter has grown so big did I come and see you, I didn’t even know that I had a daughter..” Qing Shui stood a little further away as the little girl seemed unwilling to approach him.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan looked at how Qing Shui was being careful and laughed, “It was not tough. Now that you have come to see me, I do feel very fortunate.”</p>
 <p>“Haiz… Let me deal with this little girl first or else, she will not let me hug you.” Qing Shui rubbed his head.</p>
 <p>He took out a pile of food and even killed a wild rabbit in the end to roast. This savory fragrance eventually won the little girl over. Not only did she stop crying, but she even allowed Qing Shui carry her.</p>
 <p>Sitting on the grass, Qing Shui carried his daughter in one arm and hugged Yun Duan, who was leaning on him, in the other.</p>
 <p>“Why did you come here with our daughter, what if there was danger,” Qing Shui smiled at Yun Duan. The independent and strong manner that she had was charming, comparable to the aura of a successful woman from the previous generations. However, she was very meek and docile in front of him.</p>
 <p>“It is definitely safe here, I didn’t know why but I came here. That was the first time I brought my daughter here as well, I can’t believe that I would even be able to see you.” Yun Duan raised her head happily looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it must be that our hearts interlinked. This little girl looks so beautiful, just like you!”</p>
 <p>“I have yet to name her, but her nickname is Ya Ya. What do you think our daughter’s name should be?” Yun Duan was happy talking about her daughter.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui carrying their daughter so tightly gave her a sense of happiness. The way he carried her was similar to clasping. All of a sudden, she realized that this man had matured as he carried her daughter so carefully, akin to carrying the world’s most fragile crystal, unable to mask his love for her through his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Name her Qing Yun then!” Qing Shui laughed while looking at Yun Duan, a combination of their names.</p>
 <p>“Great, now this girl has a name. Look at her nose, it looks like yours.” Yun Duan said happily, extending her arms to pinch her daughter’s little nose.</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>Without spending too much energy, Qing Shui was able to get his daughter to warm up to him. Before that, it was his sudden action of hugging Yun Duan that scared the little girl. It was all right now and he had a natural aura that attracted others to be close to him and children liked this type of aura.</p>
 <p>The naughty girl was already two years and three months old. This led Qing Shui to feel that he should have visited her when he was back from the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. His daughter would probably have been born at that time.</p>
 <p>“Duan’er, the Qing Clan has moved to the Central Continent, at Fair Wind City!” Qing Shui felt that this would be considered as good news to her.</p>
 <p>“Ah, really!” Yun Duan’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>“Of course. This is a good timing, my mother would like to see you as well as her precious granddaughter.” Qing Shui said while wiping the oily fingers of the little girl.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I am a little scared.” Yun Duan said nervously.</p>
 <p>“What is there to be scared of, we have already done the deed and are even married.”</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Yun Duan laughed bashfully and lightly thumped him.</p>
 <p>“When will you be going, I would like to visit as well. I am just afraid that your family would not like me.”</p>
 <p>“My family and mother will like whoever I liked. There is no ‘your family’ or ‘my family’. We are all a family.” Qing Shui said gently.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Back at Yun Duan’s Adventurer Guild, it was already noon. The Yun Clan were exceptionally happy to find out he was here. Previously, the development of the Yun Clan’s Adventurer Guild was very fast. Yun Duan held great influence there, Qing Shui’s method at that time shaken up everyone.</p>
 <p>Yun Tong was the younger brother of Yun Duan. He adored Qing Shui and he was even more affectionate seeing Qing Shui now. Previously before Qing Shui left, he had quite a few items for Yun Duan. Yun Tong had also benefited directly and his strength had increased with a great speed.</p>
 <p>The strongest were respected, strength determined everything!</p>
 <p>Having a little child was slightly inconvenient. They had to put the little girl to sleep in the night first before being able to be intimate. Seeing that her daughter was asleep, Yun Duan turned red.</p>
 <p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder, they could not help but hug as soon as they latched the door of the hall.</p>
 <p>The kiss from Qing Shui made Yun Duan’s entire body go soft. Her two hands hugged Qing Shui with such a strength as though she wanted Qing Shui to be kneaded into her own body.</p>
 <p>His arms grabbed what was substantial, rich and exceptionally ample. Although she had a child, her peaks were still delicate. This made Qing Shui secretly surprised, she could be considered to be a heavenly beauty.</p>
 <p>“Let me suck them!”</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had frequently sucked on them in the past, he rarely said it aloud. Now that he said it out, it made her heart beat faster, it was a type of frenetic and exciting feeling that could not be described. Seeing her beloved man burying his head in her own bosom, she felt a wave of pleasure.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan leaned over on the couch with Qing Shui mounted on her back. They were tightly joined together at the hips like glue. The powerful weapon continuously went in and out amidst the mess. It was a stimulating sight to behold.</p>
 <p>He stopped as Yun Duan’s body twitched. After embracing tightly for a while, Qing Shui then carried her to take a shower. Another round of sexual intercourse was unavoidable. Qing Shui was previously not satisfied yet, but Yun Duan could not stand to repeat it again.</p>
 <p>After an hour long shower, they headed back to the room. Qing Shui carried Yun Duan over then looked at the little girl who was fast asleep. He felt peaceful in his heart and even thought about how watching this woman like this was not a bad idea at all, it is too bad that he couldn’t in this lifetime.</p>
 <p>It is no wonder they said love was selfish. Qing Shui felt that with him constantly on the move for the past few years, he couldn’t be by his children's’ side. Just like this little girl now, he didn’t even know when she was born.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>The next day, both Qing Shui and Yun Duan bid farewell to the Yun Clan and headed to Fair Wind City. Seeing the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, Yun Duan was despondent for a moment. Although she wasn’t very powerful, she was had a lot of knowledge and experience.</p>
 <p>She did not know how strong this man is now but his Demonic Beast seemed powerful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the look on Yun Duan: “the elephant from the past had evolved into this.”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Yun Duan’s Adventurer Guild was operating smoothly and she has a decent amount of strength. Although he could not be by her side that often he should at least get her to integrate into the Qing Clan. After all, she is now a Qing Clan member.</p>
 <p>“Stay in the Qing Clan!” Qing Shui hugged Yun Duan who was leaning on him as they sat on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan nodded her head and laughed. She had waited for this day for a long time. She could leave her Adventurer Guild to Long Lingyun to manage.</p>
 <p>The nearer they were approaching Fair Wind City, the more nervous Yun Duan got.</p>
 <p>“Sister Duan, my Mother is easy-going. She pampers her children, grandsons and granddaughters. She would even treat her son’s wife as her own daughter. Just relax a little.”</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui hugged Qing Yun and Yun Duan as they walked into the Qing household. There were very little people in the front courtyard. It was nearing noon and seeing Qing Shui walking in with a beautiful woman, they were all shocked for a moment. When they saw the little girl, they were then relieved as she looked a little like Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had said that he had women outside, this should be one of them since there was a child.</p>
 <p>With one look, Qing Yi walked over and smiled. Seeing this lady beside her son who was a little uncomfortable, Qing Yi looked to the side. All the woman this brat had were stunning.</p>
 <p>“Mother, let me introduce to you. This is Yun Duan, and this is your granddaughter Qing Yun.”</p>
 <p>“Girl, this is your home in the future. If this brat dares to bully you, just let me know.” Qing Yi laughed while pulling Yun Duan’s hand.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and at the same moment, he saw Huoyun Liu-Li’s mischievous grin from a distance.</p>
 <p>“Yun Duan, it has been tough on you. The child has already grown so much and yet this rascal didn’t know.” Qing Yi pulled Yun Duan’s hand, looking at the child Qing Shui was carrying.</p>
 <p>“Mother, it wasn’t tough. I am very happy and Qing Shui was busy with his things.” Yun Duan replied with her face flushed.</p>
 <p>“You brat, what is good about you? There are so many girls that like you. You have to treat them well. Are you listening?” Qing Yi grabbed Qing Shui’s ear.</p>
 <p>“I know, I know. Ah, be gentler Mother, it’s going to fall out,” Qing Shui said exaggerating.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi laughed and had Yun Duan to familiarize herself with everyone. The little girl was unfamiliar at first, however there was Qing Yu and Qing Long, hence she did not cry. Huoyun Liu-Li then pulled Yun Duan along with Canghai Mingyue and Di Qing to chat.</p>
 <p>“Come, talk to Mother.” Qing Yi pulled Qing Shui to a side after seeing both mother and daughter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and could make a guess at what his Mother wanted to ask.</p>
 <p>“You brat, don’t you realize there are more and more women around you, all of them are excellent. Aren’t you wronging them by doing this?” Qing Yi laughed while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Mother is to be blamed for having such an outstanding son…”</p>
 <p>“Pu, how can you still say this, aren’t you ashamed?” Qing Yi smiled and hit him.</p>
 <p>“There are others outside, bring them back.”</p>
 <p>This was what she wanted to talk about.</p>
 <p>“There is one more. Hai Dongqing from the Hai Clan, at the Cold Ice City.” Qing Shui was still not telling the truth.</p>
 <p>“I am puzzled about how you turned out to be such a philanderer. Alright, you’ve grown up. I hope that you will treat them well. It is your fortune that they have all fallen for you.”</p>
