 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 2217 - The Three People from the Nine Continents Food Residence, Berserk Dragon Fist</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them continued to charge out toward Qing Shui. With a single movement, the Windwhisk Willow—stacked with the Nine Palace Steps—was activated. Qing Shui moved freely between the three of them, repeatedly unleashing Taichi Fists and continuous combos. Qing Shui's attacking force had currently reached six billion dao force and with the additional damage dealt, it was considered to be quite decent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the three of them coordinated well and Qing Shui was contemplating if he should be harsh and take their lives. If he wanted, the battle would have been over a long time ago. After all, Qing Shui was still hesitant in opposing an existence like the Nine Continents Food Residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Kill them." At this moment, Beihuang Fan's voice rang out in Qing Shui's ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui increased his speed, unleashing a Gouging Strike onto the chest of one of them and then a Drill Fist onto the person’s Shanzhong Acupoint. He then turned abruptly to attack another person, stomping on the chest of the first person in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person was injured to the brink of death. Qing Shui then turned to clash with another person. Qing Shui's current defense wasn't something they could break through. Therefore, he struck out a Stellar Transposition without any signs of dodging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A snow-white glow smashed out and the person disappeared completely. The last person remaining hesitated, unsure if he should charge forward again. At this time, Qing Shui flicked his hand and a Willow Dart shot right at that person's throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's skill in utilizing hidden weapons was terrifying. It was already so in the past and with the addition of the Liu Clan's hidden weapons method, it evolved even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Beihuang Fan stood next to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't ask why Beihuang Fan wanted to kill the three of them, but since she had spoken, she should have her own reasons for doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young man, I can only tell you that you're doomed. You aren't the only one that's doomed. Even the Divine Palace and the Taiyi Immortal Palace are doomed as well," The old man looked at Qing Shui and Beihuang Fan and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need to scare me. If the Nine Continents Food Residence was so powerful, you wouldn't be snatching other people's recipes. You guys are probably just using the name of the Nine Continents Food Residence, am I right?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man appeared very calm, "Since that is your guess, what do you think is the probability of that? Regardless, you can forget about leaving this place today!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You won't be able to restrain me here. The Bei Clan isn't an undefeatable legend in the Northern Emperor Domain. Don't push it and end up losing the entire clan. Otherwise, how would you be able to face your ancestors?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What arrogance. I'll test you out. If you were to defeat me, you won't have to fight anymore. But if you can't defeat me, you'll have to hand over the recipe. What do you think?" An awe-inspiring middle-aged man walked out and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man appeared very valiant and had a strong build. He wore black robes that were made with very exquisite workmanship. It had a scent of an unknown plant, giving off a luxurious feeling to the black robes and making the man appear very dignified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man had a pair of eagle eyes that gleamed and were sharp like blades. He stood a short distance away from the Qing Clan and there were two other people with him when he appeared. They were dressed similarly and when the Bei Clan saw these few people, they treated them with great respect. Therefore, Qing Shui guessed that they should be from the Nine Continents Food Residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Qing Shui believed that they came from the Nine Continents Food Residence was because of their strength. The man in the lead especially, probably had a strength of over 120 billion dao force. Qing Shui could only sense his strength faintly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strength made Qing Shui a little nervous and he subtly used a few abilities on Beihuang Fan and himself. Thankfully, Beihuang Fan now also had a Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda. With that, her defence would already far surpass that of her own attacking abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui silently took a step forward, shielding Beihuang Fan behind him. Qing Shui's defense was still considered very terrifying and if both parties were to battle, Qing Shui could quickly decrease his opponent's strength by half. Even if they were to have unique abilities, Qing Shui would still be able to reduce their strength by one-third or more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, with Qing Shui's defense in addition to the Battle God Halo, the Emperor's Qi, and the Art of Pursuing, he would be able to turn this expert before him into a good-for-nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was possible in theory, but the other party should have his own unique abilities as well. Regardless, Qing Shui still had the confidence in bringing down the opponent. After all, he had the Divine Weapon Flying Sword and the Stellar Transposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his condition is at its peak, the Stellar Transposition could launch a terrifying attack. With the reinforcements from the Battle God Halo, the Buddha Diamond Seal and the formation, Qing Shui's defense could double to reach around 160 billion dao force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't back off after knowing that these people were from the Nine Continents Food Residence because of his defense and his Stellar Transposition's attack. After being weakened by him, the opponent's strength of around 12 million dao force would be halved. Even if he were to have some kind of unique abilities, Qing Shui's Stellar Transposition could cripple the opponent easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you guys the ones who are interested in my recipe? Or is the Nine Continents Food Residence interested in my recipe?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My interest in your recipe means that the Nine Continents Food Residence is interested in your recipe," The man smiled and replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"May I know your standing in the Nine Continents Food Residence?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My standing is very ordinary." The man replied casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"May I know if the Nine Continents Food Residence would be alarmed if the three of you were to die here?" Qing Shui asked very seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was clearly stunned, "You're saying that you'll be able to kill me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded. "I should be able to, but I don't like trouble. So please do answer me truthfully."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man beamed. "My standing in the Nine Continents Food Residence is really very ordinary. Even if I were to disappear, it wouldn't be a cause for alarm in the Nine Continents Food Residence. If you can really kill us, then you won't have to worry about the Nine Continents Food Residence. Someone will step forth to protect you, like the Nine Continents Divine Palace."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Nine Continents Divine Palace?" Qing Shui was surprised. To think there was a Nine Continents Divine Palace. Then it would mean that there would also be a Nine Continents Demon Gate. Qing Shui wondered if the old Golden Battle God knew of the Nine Continents Divine Palace. He felt that he would need to find a chance to ask him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, since that's the case, let's start." Qing Shui nodded and struck a Buddha Diamond Seal onto himself.</span></p>

It was a very straightforward punch and its trajectory seemed very clumsy, similar to that of the Hill Moving Battle God's. However, his attack was on a higher level than the Hill Moving Battle God. This power was very strong. His speed wasn't very fast but he was very agile, which allowed him to make up for his disadvantage.</span></p>

He instantly recovered. Qing Shui felt confident, but the man had an amused expression. To think that this young man could take his Berserk Dragon Fist.</span></p>
