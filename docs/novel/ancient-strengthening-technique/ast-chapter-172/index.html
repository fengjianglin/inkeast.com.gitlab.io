 <p><strong>Chapter 172 Reunion.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 172 Reunion</strong></p>
  <p>It was actually Huoyun Liu-Li. Although she was wearing clothes of a different style, she had an aura of poise and class. Qing Shui was still sure that she was the most graceful and charming lady he had ever met.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stared at her in a daze! He had never dreamed that the boss of Earthly Paradise was actually this magnificent woman. To think that a lady who had kept herself hidden in Hundred Miles City was actually the boss of Cang Lang Country’s Earthly Paradise. Moreover, she could even manage to kill those profligate sons of Cang Lang Country and toss them out on the streets while remaining unharmed.</p>
  <p>“Why don’t you recognise your elder sister now that you’ve come to Cang Lang Country?”</p>
  <p>Her voice was still husky and had a magnetic charm. It was able to strike a chord in one’s heart. With her appearance, unique charm, and intellectual, quiet look, it made anyone harbor feelings of warmth and infatuation.</p>
  <p>“How could that be? It was just too sudden. Didn’t someone say before that there are three things in life that creates the most happiness. The first is achieving a new level of cultivation, second is going through the wedding night, and third is reuniting with friends in foreign places. Haven’t I caught up with the last event? It’s just that I have yet to recover from the happiness.” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
  <p>“It’s only been a while since we last met and you’ve become such a smooth talker now. To think that you’d even dare to tease your elder sister.” Huoyun Liu-li’s said. Her lips, sexy as flower petals, perked up to a charming and seductive curve when she heard Qing Shui’s words.</p>
  <p>Demoness. A charming demoness. Qing Shui still felt that she was like a demoness. He recalled the Pan Young Master they had met when they first entered the Cang Lang Country had mentioned a lady from Earthly Paradise. He was certain that it must have been Huoyun Liu-Li. She was definitely the one that had the most men from Cang Lang Country infatuated with her. It was because even though she was not the most beautiful, she was definitely the best at drawing out the souls of others.</p>
  <p>“How would I even dare to do that? I do not wished to be tossed out into the streets.” Qing Shui gradually relaxed.</p>
  <p>“Do you not like my way of doing things?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui and said, keeping up her smiles.</p>
  <p>“No, I like it a lot. I like people who are true to themselves. A person is only happy and feels that there is meaning to his life only when he does things that he feels what he should do. It should be done with no regrets or complaints of the devoted efforts.” Qing Shui tried to talk his way through by keeping up an appearance as if he was very serious and in deep thought.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, I can’t tell if you’re actually a person with inner character. Elder Sister likes you. Come over for some tea.” Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Huoyun Liu-Li’s beautiful eyes blinked before she broke into an intoxicating smile, as if fresh flowers had bloomed in a short moment.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui filtered off the part when she had said “Elder Sister likes you”, but he still felt very happy. It was very amazing to be able to meet someone familiar in Cang Lang Country, and especially so when it was a lady that he had an exceptionally favorable impression of.</p>
  <p>It was an empty place and Qing Shui saw that a splendid sword was hung on a wall nearby. It should be the place where Huoyun Liu-Li does her training.</p>
  <p>The two of them sat down at a coffee table made of Pineapple wood and Huoyun Liu-Li took out a pair of purple tea cups. She filled the cups with boiling hot tea that should have just been brought up.</p>
  <p>“Why did you suddenly come to Cang Lang Country? Is it to settle stuff? Or is it to stay for the long term?” Huoyun Liu-LIl put down the zisha teapot and said while smiling.</p>
  <p>“I came here to stay for the long-term. I had long yearned to experience the country and planned to stay here for some time. After taking a good look around, I’ll be able to boast about it when I go back.” Qing Shui took a sip of tea and said as he closed his eyes to appear as if he was enjoying himself.</p>
  <p>“Did you meet up with ant troubles? Is there anything I can help you with?” Huoyun Liu-Li refilled Qing Shui’s cup and said gently. Her tone was full of sincerity.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly. It was true that he was out of money, but even if he did not receive any help, it wouldn’t have been a problem. With the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would not go hungry. Qing Shui was still thankful for Huoyun Liu-Li’s concern, and especially her tone, approach, and attentiveness. She was afraid to put him in a bad spot.</p>
  <p>“Haha, are you already aware that I’m planning to eat a free meal?” Qing Shui smiled and said as he looked at the Huoyun Liu-Li who was being careful not to hurt his pride.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li only smiled at Qing Shui but did not reply.</p>
  <p>“Actually, I’m here today to look for the boss of Earthly Paradise to discuss business. However, I didn’t expect for the boss to be an outstanding beauty, and the one who had helped me before.” Qing Shui drank the tea and said casually.</p>
  <p>“Stop being flippant and speak up. Since you are here to discuss business with the boss of Earthly Paradise, it’s easier to work things out now that it’s someone familiar. In a way, we can be regarded as acquaintances.” Huoyun Liu-Li chided.</p>
  <p>“Of course. I will treat you as my best friend, so I don’t want to talk about business anymore. Earlier, I even found out that while you earn a lot, you spend a lot of your money on the children from poor families to ensure that they are able to meet basic living needs. It’s just that I do not understand how much Earthly Paradise earns.” Qing Shui had heard Little Shu share some information of Huoyun Liu-Li handling a lot of deeds that required a lot of money, but did not ask for any compensation.</p>
  <p>“No need to worry about the money. While I spend a considerable sum of money on the poor, you’ve also seen for yourself the prices I set in this place. The prices are still very steep, which results from both needs and from the standard. My restaurant is targeted at the rich, to leech the money from the wealthy.” Huoyun Liu-Li took a small sip of tea and said as her beautiful brows perked up charmingly.</p>
  <p>“You’ve thought too much. I have something that can be made into delicious cuisines that are even better than your best delicacy here. I initially wanted to get some money out of it, but since it is your restaurant, there’s no reason for me to not give it to you. If you end up earning a lot of money, I’ll appreciate it if you can give this younger brother some food and money.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui for a while before she pouted her sexy lips. “You really have something like that? Do you really think that your Elder Sister will treat you shabbily? When did your Elder Sister ever do that? Is your image of me that bad?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui thought about it and agreed. Thinking back on the value of that Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and the few interrogative questions posed to him, Qing Shui started to break out in cold sweat. Until now, Qing Shui could not understand why this lady had gifted him such an invaluable item as the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron.</p>
  <p>Thinking about it made Qing Shui extremely embarrassed as the sweat on his head seemed to be on the verge of trickling down. Huoyun Liu-Li also looked puzzledly at the sweat on Qing Shui’s forehead. “What happened? Are you not feeling well?”</p>
  <p>“No, I just thought of the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron that Elder Sister had given me.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was stunned for a moment before she broke out into a light laughter. Her slightly husky voice was like taking drugs, making it hard for Qing Shui to tear himself away. She was an intoxicating demoness.</p>
  <p>“When did you break through to Xiantian?” Qing Shui asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>“A few years back…”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li quickly realised that Qing Shui was actually testing her. She chided him, “You rascal. You are getting worse now. Couldn’t you just ask me directly? To think that you tried to play stunts. That cannot do, so now I must punish you.”</p>
  <p>“What punishment would you like to inflict upon me? I’ll agree to anything except to be pledged to you by marriage.” Qing Shui said apologetically.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui with her beautiful eyes without blinking. Only when Qing Shui started to feel uncomfortable did she craftily said, “Recently I started to feel that my waist is sore and legs are in pain. The punishment for the doctor here is to give me a massage.”</p>

 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li quickly realised that Qing Shui was actually testing her. She chided him, “You rascal. You are getting worse now. Couldn’t you just ask me directly? To think that you tried to play stunts. That cannot do, so now I must punish you.”</p>
 <p>“What punishment would you like to inflict upon me? I’ll agree to anything except to be pledged to you by marriage.” Qing Shui said apologetically.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui with her beautiful eyes without blinking. Only when Qing Shui started to feel uncomfortable did she craftily said, “Recently I started to feel that my waist is sore and legs are in pain. The punishment for the doctor here is to give me a massage.”</p>
