 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at this old man. His hair had turned white and his eyes had lost every bit of its charm, leaving behind only the coldness of a snake and the presence of a threat. Having trained to this level, he must have had the same strength as Qing Shui himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s body was long, and he looked at Qing Shui wearing a white gown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be the Sect Leader of the Water Dragon Gate.” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The old man said peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I couldn’t find you before, but I’ve finally run into you. That’s good, because you have heard what I had discussed previously. I wasn’t sure whether you wanted any changes or not.” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“None whatsoever. However, I believe we should have a bout.” The old man suggested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face had a smile was a little dark, but wasn’t the type that was especially scary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, we’ll have one. That way, when I leave, I will be at peace. I will come every now and then but I can’t just stay here.” Qing Shui said with the tone he would have used if he were to talk to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about this? I will stay still. As long as you can hit me, you win. What do you think?” Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, have you gone mad?” The Water Dragon Gate Sect Leader was a little angry, seeing how he was being looked down upon like that but he wasn’t much more angered beyond that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui daring to say this was naturally because he knew he could do it. The old man’s strength wasn’t much over 20 billion Dao. It was not bad and was probably one of the strongest in the Northern Sea, not counting those that hid their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Divine Weapon could negate damage more than twice and the Emperor’s Qi could weaken strength by two times. Even if the old man was using a trump card, there’d be no use since Qing Shui could get rid of 4 billion Dao in damage. If that wasn’t enough, he could get rid of another 22 billion Dao in damage...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking account of these, the old man shouldn’t be able to do much to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui really didn’t move and he didn’t even use the Emperor’s Qi as he took the attack head-on from the Water Dragon Gate Sect Leader. He stood strong as a mountain, a thin layer of protection on his body was the only thing between him and the attack. It was the effect of the Defence talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After attacking many times, the old man’s face turned white. He even used his trump card to corrupt him. The attack Qing Shui used on him was even stronger than the one he had used previously, and now the lesser of the Sect Leaders was no longer feeling any pressure, having seen the Sect Leader himself being beaten like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you need me to do anything else?” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve lost. I’ll admit it. I’ll comply with your wishes, don’t worry. If there’s anything you need me to do, just tell me.” The Water Dragon Gate Sect Leader accepted his loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui found out that this man was really a smart person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After thinking for a bit, Qing Shui took out an Ancient Demonic Fruit and some pills before giving it to him: “Do you want to have the Water Dragon Gate go a bit further, into the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Water Dragon Gate Sect Leader was very happy. Looking at Qing Shui, he knew that this young man was very scary, and had to have a lot of strength. This was his origin. Showing good intentions to someone this strong which would be very advantageous and wouldn’t be a poor choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mr. Xuan Lie will go on an errand.” The Water Dragon Gate Sect Leader said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are still the Leader of the Water Dragon Gate, so I won’t treat you poorly. Once you’re an ally, if anything bad happens, I will make a move. The Sea King Palace is at Beiyun River, and will enter the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain. I suppose I don’t need to talk about the basics.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand, don’t worry. I’ve been around for a while. I’ll get it done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Items I have just given you are enough to increase your strength by onefold. It would also solidify your base by one time. I view the Nine-Headed Mystic Snakes in a very good light so from now on, the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain will have you as a part.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui left, and Xuan Lie was so happy that he couldn’t stay calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Leader.” The Left Vice Sect Leader said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to tell others what happened today. What you have given us today is a one in a million chance, and we will make the most out of it.” Xuan Lie was relatively good at determining the strength of other people and he saw this young man in a good light. In additions, he had also been given those pills that were obviously uncommon, especially the fruit, which was a godlike item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His own strength had increased by one-fold, and his foundation was solidified one time just like Qing Shui said. Now, there was no one who could challenge him in the Northern Sea. As soon as he thought of his opportunity to get to the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain, he became excited. Besides, he remembered that young man said that there would be a place for his clan there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui returned to Beiyun River, explained what was going on, and told them that it was completely resolved. The entire clan of the Nine-Headed Mystic Snakes was valued highly in Qing Shui’s eyes, especially the Sect Leader, who he had looked at with his Heavenly Vision Technique. Even if he himself couldn’t help him, he could use the Nine-Headed Mystic Snakes, which meant that he could come on top this time no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few days later, a group of people from the Sea King Palace came. There were many this time, including the Carps, and the Black Dragon Lords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon returning, he saw Beihuang Fan at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, who pouted when she saw Qing Shui: “You didn’t even tell me when you left.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want me that much?” Qing Shui said, surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think you’re just a big headed devil.” Beihuang Fan said, still pouting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you were that worried about me? You’ve made my heart race.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, quit joking. Next time you go somewhere, just remember to tell me. I might just accompany you.” Beihuang Fan said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a little touched from that. He felt very lucky to be cared about by someone no matter the reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, then you must have been fine these past few days.” Qing Shui asked casually.</span></p>

They even said that there would be no use in hiding or protecting yourself,” Beihuang Fan said this with an undertone of worry.</span></p>

Their Cong Yunlong husband and wife were being persecuted by the Golden Rakshas. The wife had a child and came to me for help and as they were leaving, the Golden Rakshas arrived. After that, they killed the Golden Rakshas, which seemed to be a part of the Ye family. Seems like the Golden Rakshas have found out about this incident.” Qing Shui explained plainly.</span></p>

At the very least, we have to protect ourselves, which wouldn’t be a problem since I’ll be doing most of that. Don’t worry.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>

Even if you are going to protect me, you should still fake it to make it look like it was me protecting you,” Qing Shui.</span></p>
