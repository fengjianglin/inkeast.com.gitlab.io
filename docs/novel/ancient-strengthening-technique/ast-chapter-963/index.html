 <p><strong>AST 963 - The Twelve Portraits of Beauty, The Twelve Heavenly Meridians? The Secret?</strong></p>
 <p>The Fifth Heavenly Meridian had been cleared!</p>
 <p>That exact moment felt wonderful. One of the Heavenly Meridians had been cleared when he was with Mu Qing and that was the Fourth Heavenly Meridian. But he had no idea when the other three were cleared. When the Fourth Heavenly Meridian was cleared, he had just attained the small success stage.</p>
 <p>So he had only realized that four among the Twelve Heavenly Meridians had been cleared when the Fourth Heavenly Meridian was cleared. Another one was actually cleared again this time, the Fifth Heavenly Meridian. The last time when he attained the small success stage, there were some subtle changes in his spirit energy. His strength had also been increased by ten stars. But now, Qing Shui knew that the ten stars was the outcome of his Duo Cultivation with Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>Although there weren’t any obvious changes in his spirit energy this time, his strength was still increased by ten stars. He had his woman in a tight embrace at this moment. Her strength had also been increased by ten stars…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He was weaker than his woman in the past, yet he received the biggest benefits in the end. But he realized that things had changed recently. Mu Qing had received more than double the benefits last time compared to him. And although there was a great disparity between Hai Dongqing’s strength and his strength now, her increase in strength was about the same as his.</p>
 <p>So the unnamed cultivation technique actually had this type of balancing effects…</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing was quite shocked too. She was currently leaning docilely in Qing Shui’s arms while staring at him in shock. She had never expected that her strength would increase this way too. Furthermore, this strength increase was a little terrifying.</p>
 <p>“Do you feel good?” Qing Shui’s hands were caressing the silk-like skin. He simply couldn’t stop caressing that perky and perfectly round plump rear lovingly.</p>
 <p>“Not telling...”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled. So this woman actually had such an adorable side to her. Looking at that translucent ear, Qing Shui leaned over to suck it. He nibbled his way around her whole ear before thrusting his tongue gently inside.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing visibly jumped and trembled fervently. She immediately held on to Qing Shui tightly. Qing Shui released her ear in surprise. So she could also be satisfied with just this...?</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing was so embarrassed that she couldn’t lift her head up. Since when did this meanie know that her ears were untouchable...?</p>
 <p>“Qing’er!”</p>
 <p>“Hm?” Hai Dongqing responded languidly without raising her head. She didn’t have an ounce of energy left in her now, but she was very happy because she was finally Qing Shui’s woman.</p>
 <p>“We’re sending out the invitations tomorrow and holding the wedding reception the day after tomorrow.” Qing Shui made up his mind. There were neither mistresses, nor concubines among his women. He’d given all of them equal status. In his previous world, not even a high official could brazenly do something like this. But this was the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing was taken aback, but laughed happily, “I don’t care about all that.”</p>
 <p>“I do though. I want to tell everyone that you are my woman. Otherwise, what will I do if you escape?” Qing Shui held her hands tightly and smiled.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing spontaneously pecked Qing Shui’s lips and laughed, “I’ll listen to whatever you say!”</p>
 <p>……....</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got up in the morning to do his morning practice. His physical strength had been increased by another ten stars again now, reaching a total of 110 stars. He practiced his Taichi Fist in high spirits. Hai Dongqing was watching him from the window upstairs.</p>
 <p>He informed the Hai Clan about holding a wedding reception in the morning and the invitations were sent out immediately. After Hai Shiya found out about it, she naturally came here again to say something. She even praised how quick Hai Dongqing was, making her unable to stop blushing.</p>
 <p>“Auntie, did you get a good night’s sleep last night?” Hai Shiya was experienced, so she could observe the changes in Hai Dongqing from just a single glance. Only someone who had turned into a woman would have this perception.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Hai Dongqing had lost the powerful position she used to have in front of her niece.</p>
 <p>Even Qing Shui was extremely embarrassed. After all, Hai Shiya was their junior…</p>
 <p>“Damn lass. Hurry up and leave. Go get busy with your own things. What nonsense are you talking about?” Hai Dongqing dragged Hai Shiya away with a red face in the end.</p>
 <p>Looking at the current Hai Dongqing, a satisfied smile broke onto Qing Shui’s face.</p>
 <p>Many people in Cold Ice City knew that the Hai Clan’s head was going to marry very soon and were paying close attention to this news. The people who heard the news were also filled with wonder. They were all asking around to identify which clan’s son was blessed enough to marry the Hai Clan’s head.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing was the top expert on the surface of Cold Ice City. The Hai Clan was also the most influential clan in Cold Ice City nowadays. Many people had received the wedding invitation. Some were happy, some were concerned.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Clan of Cold Ice City!</p>
 <p>A dashing young man held the invitation in his hands. His eyebrows were closely knitted together. The expression on his face was very unpleasant and there was even a trace of sadness in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Beside him was a tall lady with slanted eyes. Her graceful eyebrows were slightly raised on the ends, causing her to appear somewhat heroic. Her straight nose was small and exquisite. She was currently looking at the man with a worried expression.</p>
 <p>“Big brother. Although you broke through, your strength is only almost the same as that woman from Hai Clan. Besides, love isn’t based on strength. It has been a few years. Just give up!” the lady urged with a sigh.</p>
 <p>“What do I, Shangguan Fei, lack? I am willing to do anything for her and she is the only person I like. Yet why can’t she just give me a chance?” the man said defeatedly.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, things like love cannot be forced. On top of that, she’s the Hai Clan’s head. Do you know who is she marrying today?” Shangguan Jing looked at his big brother and said in resignation.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei shook his head.</p>
 <p>“It’s that guy who eliminated the Tu Clan and Luo Clan back then. It’s been about a decade. Ten years ago, that man’s strength was about the same as your current strength. He was only a little more than 20 years old back then.” Shangguan Jing didn’t want to shock her big brother, but at the same time she wanted to give him a wake up call.</p>
 <p>“I’m not going to take this lying down. I want to see just what kind of person can make her wait for him for a few years.” Shangguan Fei clenched his teeth.</p>
 <p>“You’ll know when you attend the wedding reception tomorrow. But big brother, don’t overdo it. That’s the Hai Clan’s wedding reception. Don’t disgrace them,” Shangguan Jing said after pondering for a moment.</p>
 <p>“The strongest person in Hai Clan has about the same strength as me. Our father and grandfather are way more powerful than her. What is there to be afraid of?” The man thought for a moment and told his younger sister.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, I knew you wouldn’t be able to catch it. It would be fine when Hai Dongqing didn’t marry back then. Even if you don’t put the Hai Clan in your eyes, don’t forget about that man. Do you know what his strength is now?” The lady shook her head, seemingly frustrated. Her big brother had always been a bright guy, but he seemed to only be dense when it came to these kinds of matters.</p>
 <p>“He shouldn’t be that strong……” The man seemed to have sobered up a little.</p>
 <p>“The Lei Clan of Duanmu City was effortlessly eliminated by him. Do you think we the Shangguan Clan are stronger than the Lei Clan?” Shangguan Jing knew that he wasn’t going to wake up if she didn’t give him a stronger wake up call. She feared that this big brother of hers would get the Shangguan Clan destroyed by his recklessness.</p>
 <p>She didn’t mention this earlier because she was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to take it. But now, she was left with no choice.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei immediately wilted, like a withered eggplant after being frozen. They were neither too far from, nor too close to Duanmu City. Everyone knew some influential clans since it would be easier to deal with them whenever necessary. The Shangguan Clan was indeed inferior to the Lei Clan.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Clan was a big clan that had newly moved into Cold Ice City. Their clan didn’t make it to the top three most influential clans of Cold Ice City. Not because they weren’t qualified but rather because they came late. Besides, they had never really thought of competing for this reputation because many knew how strong the Shangguan Clan was. This was more than enough. Superficial fame could be tiring.</p>
 <p>He knew that the Lei Clan had been destroyed. Although it was a short amount of time, news like this spread like wildfire. After all, it could be considered a neighboring city although it was slightly further away.</p>
 <p>The lady left without saying anything further. She believed that her brother knew what to do now.</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>The people of the Hai Clan were busy decorating and distributing invitation cards. Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing were very free instead. No one bothered them because they knew that Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing didn’t have much time left together, so they left all the time for them.</p>
 <p>“Qing’er, do you want to leave with me?” Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing was talking a walk on the plains.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the Hai Clan right now…”</p>
 <p>“I know, I understand. I will support you as a husband!” Qing Shui gave her a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>“When are you leaving?” Hai Dongqing actually didn’t want to ask this question.</p>
 <p>“The day after tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>“Then promise me that you will definitely come spend two days with me whenever you pass by here.” Hai Dongqing knew that he’d be leaving soon, so she forced herself to smile.</p>
 <p>“Even if I didn’t pass by here, I’d still come to visit you. With such a beautiful and lovely lady waiting for me, I will want to come here every day.” Qing Shui loved looking at her shy face.</p>
 <p>Wen Qing Shui looked at Hai Dongqing, he remembered about the Fifth Heavenly Meridian being cleared during the Duo Cultivation. Then he recalled that Hai Dongqing was one of the ladies on the Portraits of Beauty. 12 Heavenly Meridians, 12 Portraits of Beauty…</p>
 <p>Could it be that the Heavenly Meridians could only be cleared by the Divine Bodies of those ladies on the Portraits of Beauty? What would happen when the 12 Heavenly Meridians were cleared? Could this be the secret of the 12 Portraits of Beauty?</p>
 <p>Five Heavenly Meridians had been cleared. Canghai Mingyue, Lady Duanmu, that peerless beauty in the crystal coffin and Hai Dongqing, these four ladies were from the Portraits of Beauty. If his deduction was correct, one more woman among all the ones that he had ever slept with was from a Portrait of Beauty.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li, Zhu Qing, Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, Yun Duan, Mu Qing… which one?</p>
 <p>Thinking up to this point, Qing Shui was no longer thinking about the Portraits of Beauty. He instead realized that he already had ten women…</p>
 <p>In the World of the Nine Continents, this figure wasn’t really a surprise. A cultivator with the strength of a Martial King usually had more than ten wives and concubines. But Qing Shui was different. He was actually a very traditional man deep in his bones…</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking so deeply about?” Hai Dongqing asked when she saw Qing Shui lost in his thoughts.</p>
 <p>“I’m thinking about home!” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>On the next day, many people came to attend the wedding reception. Being the city’s most influential power meant that there wouldn’t be a lack of guests when it came to holding this kind of banquet. Everyone had their own social circle and each of these standings were very stable. If the others were beyond their reach even when they had extended their arms, then they wouldn’t think about it anymore. Just like how some Xiantian Cultivators Clan would never think of getting involved with a Martial Saint or Martial Emperor Cultivators Clans. They wouldn’t even have the slightest idea of doing so. They were very content, because ordinary people still remained the largest population in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>The ordinary people were very content too, because they were surrounded by ordinary people. Although a powerful Xiantian cultivator might emerge among them from time to time, it was one in a million chance. Although they were envious, life still went on.</p>
 <p>The Cheng Clan had arrived long ago. They had a close relationship with the Hai Clan and Qin Clan. The influential figures in Cold Ice City would come. Reputation was of utmost importance. The big clans could afford to lose anything except for face. If someone sent you an invitation, not attending would mean that you were looking down upon them. Even if you attended, if your gifts were too shabby then you would be disgracing yourself.</p>
