 <p><strong>AST 1212 - Meteor Rush. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant That Soared Up The Skies With A Single Step</strong></p>
 <p>The Tidal Cloud Waves Seal got vaporized instantly by the countless cluster of flames. Despite the fact that water was said to overthrow fire according to the theory of the five elements, the gap between the strength of Qing Shui’s Tidal Cloud Waves Seal and the strength of the fire was far too large.</p>
 <p>A problem finally arose. Despite Qing Shui’s powerful resistance against fire, the strength of his opponent’s flame prove to be even stronger. The weak and frail attack of his lost its function right away.</p>
 <p>The only thing that Qing Shui could do was to avoid it. Occasionally, he would use the Ten Thousand Years Cold Steel Beads to attack the eyes of the fire dragon. Its weaknesses were its eyes and the scale that was below its neck.</p>
 <p>The girls had already disappeared into the distance. Despite so, Qing Shui didn’t dare to leave as he feared that it might pursue after the girls. If that happens, the girls wouldn’t be able to run away from the fire dragon as it was too fast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his speed to the maximum. Even with the additional aid provided by the Nine Palace Steps, he only managed to barely dodge the dragon. It was so bad that even at certain occasions, he need to use the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring. Being pushed back under this kind of circumstances, Qing Shui noticed that his Nine Palace Steps had improved significantly compared to before.</p>
 <p>The more dangerous situation a person was in, the more their potential would be drawn out. Now, Qing Shui had even used the Gold Needle Acupuncture.</p>
 <p>It’s just that fighting against the fire dragon made it very difficult for him to even catch his breath. Hence, he considered whether he would run away or continue to fight for a little bit longer. If he were to really take the bet and fight, he would need to think of a method to successfully attack the opponent’s eyes or scale in order to injure it. It would be best if he could beat it until it was half-dead.</p>
 <p>The only problem was that both of the said locations weren’t something which he could target so easily.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui use the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring to escape later, he would feel a bit upset. After all, he was a bit reluctant to let go of this opportunity of running into a baby dragon. However, he wasn’t really confident that he would emerge victorious if he chose to fight.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt really reluctant to give up. This was because the said dragon happened to be something which he needed the most at the moment as he wanted to refine demons. His intention was to refine this baby dragon onto the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, giving the dragon bloodline within it a boost. Once the dragon bloodline received a boost, the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant could right away received a significant increase . After all, the elephant had now already reached a mature state. As long as the purity of the dragon bloodline within it got boosted, its strength would immediately go through substantial changes. This was the advantages of a bloodline.</p>
 <p>Even though the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was constantly increasing within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it wasn’t really useful under this kind of situations. For a short period of time, the elephant would still be able to evade attacks and the Thunderous Beast could provide Qing Shui with some aid. Hence, while he evade all the attacks, Qing Shui also thought about what he should do next.</p>
 <p>He wanted to at least give it a try. If he really could successfully refine the dragon, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant would be able to participate in the battles of the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring to quickly dodge the attacks. After that, he summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and he once again went near the fire dragon to distract it. On the other hand, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, which was just a bit further away, would use the Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp from time to time.</p>
 <p>It would also use the Vajra Subdues Demons. This could help it regain the strength which was previously weakened within a short period of time.</p>
 <p>It was still better than doing nothing. Qing Shui once again took another opportunity to summon the Thunderous Beast using the same method.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast used Thunderbolt from far away. This attack was used to paralyze the fire dragon. This was exactly what Qing Shui was betting on, whether such small attack would be neglected by the fire dragon. If it didn’t, he assumed that he would most likely have to temporarily keep the Thunderous Beast back.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui amplified his attacks towards the fire dragon. He continuously attacked the eyes of the fire dragon with his hidden and poisonous weapons.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never thought that there would be a day where he would battle against a monster that was just like a dragon. This was the legendary dragon species. Most importantly, it was still really small but it already had a terrifying fierce aura. It was just that because it was still a baby, it wasn’t strong enough. In spite of that, it was already enough to prove that it was a very difficult opponent for Qing Shui even at his best.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dared not to imagine the strength of an adult dragon.</p>
 <p>Time passed little by little. Qing Shui had slowly adjusted his footwork, as they appeared more and more profound. Slowly, he surprisingly was able to push back the fire dragon a little. This was already a huge improvement. Of course, the thunderbolt attacks casted by the Thunderous Beast had also played a huge part in it.</p>
 <p>Against the fire dragon, the thunderbolt was just like cooking frogs with warm water. By the time it realized this problem, things were already too late, so much that even until the moment it died, it still didn’t know what was wrong.</p>
 <p>Despite that being the case, Qing Shui had also used Divinity Protection once and made the Thunderous Beast used the Violet Lightning Strike to aid him in his escape. Moreover, he also used the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring around 50 times to keep himself alive. It was only after he did all of these that he was slowly able to start standing on his own ground.</p>
 <p>Against an opponent with strength like this, this was already considered as Qing Shui’s limit. To be able to face off against an opponent with 500,000 nimbus of strength, with his strength lower than 100,000 nimbus up to this kind of extent. And on top of that, it was against a dragon species of demonic beast. If words got spread out, it would be more than enough to make others drop their jaw.</p>
 <p>Now, the situation of the battle was rising back again little by little. However, it only made Qing Shui feel more calm ash e possessed good endurance.If it was a normal people, they would have most likely collapsed by now.</p>
 <p>The reaction time as well as the speed of the fire dragon had dropped down by more than 20%. With the additional aid provided by the Seal of Xuantian as well as the Emperor’s Qi from before which had weakened it, Qing Shui was now able to stand firmly on his ground and face off against the dragon. Now, what he needed to do was to deal a serious injury to the fire dragon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a bit safe with the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. Without it, he didn’t dare to imagine the number of times which he might have died.</p>
 <p>Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel Beads!</p>
 <p>They had been dipped in poisons before. Qing Shui was holding them in his hands.</p>
 <p>He communicated with the Thunderous Beast through his mind and made it used the Violet Lightning Strike.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>Almost at that instant that the Violet Lightning Strike was casted, Qing Shui abruptly formed a seal with both of his hands. A ray of meteor-like cold light flashed and it had a profound strength.</p>
 <p>Meteor Rush!</p>
 <p>Two rays of cold light shot out of his hands. They both formed a straight line and the distance between the two lights were infinitesimal. It’s just that halfway in the air, the cold light at the back abruptly clashed into the one at the front.</p>
 <p>As this happened, the the cold light in front once again experienced a rapid increase in speed. It now looked as fast as a spark.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Kong!</p>
 <p>Demon Binding Rope!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to slow down. He tossed out the Demon Binding Rope and after that, he once again swung down the Big Dipper Sword in his hand.</p>
 <p>Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui felt really nervous. He had already managed to hurt one of the fire dragon’s eyes. Furthermore, the Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel Beads had been dipped in poison before.</p>
 <p>One of the fire dragon’s eye had turned blind. Simultaneously, the poison would also spread throughout its body from its eye. While all of these happened, the Thunderous Beast continuously attacked it with its thunder attributed attacks.</p>
 <p>The fire dragon was enraged.</p>
 <p>Its enormous roaring noise alone was heaven-shakingly loud and clear. Fresh blood could be seen flowing out of its enormous eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also panicked. He once again used the Meteor Rush.</p>
 <p>So far, this was Qing Shui’s hidden weapon technique with the most dire killing power. It was also one of his fastest hidden weapon method.</p>
 <p>Primordial Demon Refining Furnace!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace almost immediately. He even imbued it with his Divine Force. In an instant, numerous roars of demonic beasts were heard. There were a lot of demonic beasts on top of it, they looked just like the real things. Among them, there was a golden-colored divine dragon. For a moment, it actually made this ‘baby fire dragon’ quieted down.</p>
 <p>Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui injected rays after rays of buddha imprint on his hands into the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. After that, he activated the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace which was increasing in size immediately enveloped both the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the fire dragon.</p>
 <p>Beng!</p>
 <p>A depressing noise of collision resounded. The enormous Primordial Demon Refining Furnace had also started to shake.</p>
 <p>Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui operated his spirit energy all the way to its maximum.</p>
 <p>Wealth often came with risk!</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace shrank little by little while he constantly poured in his spirit energy into it.</p>
 <p>The demonic beasts pictures on top of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace started to give out brilliant light. It was as if they were almost going to fly out.</p>
 <p>Both his Yin and Yang Image, as well as the golden star within his sea of consciousness, got brighter and brighter. A kind of pressure was released towards the surrounding. However, Qing Shui was unable to attend to other matters around him at the moment.</p>
 <p>High grade Focused Concentration.</p>
 <p>Even though a lot of Qing Shui’s abilities were blended into the Seven-colored Pellets, he could still use them individually. However, just like the High Grade Focused Concentration, it would no longer be able to go through things like 20% increase in strength like before anymore. Nevertheless, it could still help him to focus his mind and willpower.</p>
 <p>When it first began, Qing Shui palpitated with fear and anxiety. The reason for that was because the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was shaking very violently. It looked as if it was almost going to turn upside down. The reason why he felt confident was because the fire dragon was just still a baby dragon. On top of that, it was also already injured and the poison within it was also very powerful.</p>
 <p>Maybe because of the effect of the poison was becoming more and more dire, or maybe because of the might of the divine dragon on top of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, the furnace slowly began to quiet down. It was about a hundred meters huge.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was finally able to let out a long sigh of relief now. His clothes were totally covered in sweat. To face an enormous temptation upfront, very few would actually be able to control their heart.</p>
 <p>It was very likely that Qing Shui only dared to do all of these because he had the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring. However, backlash might occur in the process of refining demons and once this happened, the consequences would be really serious. Prior to this, Qing Shui had thought about this but still, he was unable to resist himself from its temptation. He knew that the consequences of backlash when refining just this baby dragon wouldn’t be that bad to cause his own life. Hence, he thought that when worst come to worst, he would just run for his life.</p>
 <p>Now, he should have been able to foresee its success.</p>
 <p>He felt both excited and happy. In the meantime, he also started to wonder what extent the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant would evolve after it absorbed the pure dragon bloodline.</p>
 <p>Time went on little by little. It was his second time to carry out this method of refining demons. The method he used was refining two demonic beasts together by extracting the pure strength from one of the beasts and dissolving it into the body of the other one.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui was doing was precisely dissolving the essence of the dragon bloodline into the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, to activate the hidden potential of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant which would cause a fundamental change within its body and could trigger evolutions.</p>
 <p>Time passed little by little. It had already been a few hours since the three girls left. The process of refining demons was also approaching its end.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui started refining the demons, he already let out the Fire Bird and quickly wrote down a letter. He made the Fire Bird flew towards the direction where the girls disappeared into. He wanted to at least tell them that he was safe to ease their worries. He knew that there was no problem for him to stay alive, he just wanted to inform them not to come and find him as he would go to them on his own in a while.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace quieted down. The totems carved on top of it also slowly lost its radiance, as it restored its usual simple and unadorned patterns. However, the size of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was already fixed at about 100 meters.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui agitatedly put back the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace.</p>
 <p>ROAR!</p>
 <p>A heaven-shakingly loud roaring noise of a beast that resembled the cry of a dragon resounded. The next thing which came into his sight was a gold and shiny demonic beast with a malevolent and enormous dragon head. Its neck was almost ten meters thick. The golden scales across its body looked just like the dragon scales from legends. As for its appearance, it looked almost the same as the previous Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. The only thing that changed was that it was smaller than before.</p>
 <p>One of the most noticeable changes was that its neck became longer. The scale armor across its body had also changed. Putting those aside, another thing which went through changes was its powerful aura. Its current strength was already at a level which could no longer be compared to how it used to be in the past.</p>
 <p>Previously, the raw strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had also increased quite a lot over a long period of time within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It also received aids from things like medicinal pills.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui revealed a happy smile. Even though the demon that was refined was only a young dragon, this very pure dragon bloodline alone was already enough to trigger a burst in the bloodline of this very Heaven and Earth Battle Beast. Now, its strength was rising rapidly.</p>
 <p>The raw strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had achieved 20,000 nimbus…...</p>
 <p>This was what was known as a true skyrocketing improvement, ascending to the skies with a single step! As Qing Shui sensed the terrifying strength within the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, he could now confirm that the fire dragon from before was of a pure dragon species. This incident had triggered a tremendous change in the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. After that, Qing Shui used his Heavenly Vision Technique to take a peek at the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s current battle techniques.</p>
