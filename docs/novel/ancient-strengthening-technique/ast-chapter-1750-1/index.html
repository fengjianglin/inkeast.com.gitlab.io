 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was how the world in the ocean domain really looked like. Qing Shui only regained his senses after so long. He had always thought that the ocean domain was filled with desolate areas, with only caves around and such. It was only now that he knew he was wrong, very, very wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, he gained a brand new knowledge of the world in the water domain. His understanding of the landscape was now more comprehensive than it had been before. The world in the water was even bigger than that on the land, and there were also more races. At the very least, the land of the nine continents wasn't as huge as the one in the ocean domain. This was a straightforward evaluation. After all, no one really knew how vast the land of the nine continents was, nor how deep the water of the ocean domain was. He had only come to the conclusion through his own feelings and inferences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's take a look around here. There might be someone selling the Sacred Mudra Flower here." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was stunned for a moment before she smiled. Of course, she didn't believe that there would be people selling the Sacred Mudra Flower. Putting aside that it was an extremely rare item, who would be so generous to be selling them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright. Where shall we go first? The inn or the medicinal hall?" Muyun Qingge asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's head to the inn first, since there should be more news there. We might be able to hear some useful information." Qing Shui said as he took the lead and looked for an inn on the wide streets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking into the distance, there was an endless stretch of the lively market. There were all sorts of tribes on the streets and many of them preserved the special traits of their tribes. Those who appeared very close to that of humans would mean that their bloodline was nobler or that they were stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">North Yang Ocean Domain</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This area belonged to the North Yang Ocean Domain. Qing Shui had already heard it from some conversations in the surroundings. Muyun Qingge walked a little behind Qing Shui as she looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, there's an inn there!" Muyun Qingge looked into the distance and said as she pointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had been looking at the vicinity. He wasn't anxious and was just taking a casual look around. When he heard Muyun Qingge's words, he looked in the direction she was pointing to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drunken Night Inn</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the words and didn't feel that it was special. However, there was an incessant stream of traffic before the inn which showed that their business was quite good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The carriages in the ocean domain were pulled by seahorses. These seahorses were different from the one in Qing Shui's previous life. They were like the horses on land, but with four very large soles. They had two horns on their heads and when they ran, it was with a very light step. They were many times faster compared to the galloping horses on the land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Aquatics won't sense anything around them when they were in the water. It was just like when the humans were on the land. However, in the water, they moved nimbly like a fish and the dimension in which they could move was wider. They could move up, down, front, back, left and right. On land, humans could only move front, back, left and right. When they wanted to move upward or downward, they must have a certain level of cultivation that would allow them to fly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The land area taken up by the Drunken Night Inn was huge. There were no restrictions on the people entering or leaving the inn. However, there were guards at the door and before entering, one must give the guards a demonic beast's crystal nuclei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a lot of crystal nuclei. In the ocean domain, gold and crystal nuclei were existences which had purchasing power. Many demonic beasts raised their cultivation through absorbing the energies in crystal nuclei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The difference between Cores and crystal nuclei were that ordinary Cores require refinement and not just any demonic beast would be able to absorb them. However, the majority of them could absorb crystal nuclei, but there were some restrictions. For example, there wouldn't be much effect for cultivators to absorb the crystal nuclei of demonic beasts on the same or lower level. They would only be able to absorb crystal nuclei when they were not fully satiated. If they had reached a bottleneck, they won't be able to absorb them any more and must wait until they broke through a new level, before they could absorb more crystal nuclei to improve their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their cultivation must be stabilized. Otherwise, the absorption effect would be greatly discounted and they might even enter a state of Qi Deviation. It could be possible that they wouldn't be able to absorb them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The buildings here weren't especially high and weren't closely built together. It could be because they had a lot of lands. Most buildings were about six stories high, in Qing Shui’s previous life, they were about two stories high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were people standing guard at every single staircase and to ascend one story higher, one must pay up a demonic beast's crystal nuclei. Of course, food and wine would be charged separately. Moreover, there were also ladies with revealing clothes and well-embodied figures moving around, satisfying customers' varying needs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brothels were a common sight both on the land and in the water. Moreover, most people who could operate such services must be of a certain level of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge seemed to treat these as a common sight and followed Qing Shui up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hey Sir, are you here for food or for accommodations?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft and coyish voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A charming lady walked over. She was tall and well-embodied. When she walked, the two balls at her chest kept jiggling, as if they were a pair of joyous little rabbits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sensed the lady's aura. She wasn't strong. Of course, this was from his perspective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"For food!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady was both a team leader and a waitress. She was also an existence similar to a brothel keeper. The prostitutes in this place were mostly under her rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sir, this way, please. Your wife is really beautiful. It seems that you won't fancy our ladies here." The lady smiled and said as they walked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ladies in such environments were very open and had the tendency to sound tough as well. They felt that this was how the world was. This was the world in the ocean domain. It was very common for a powerful man to bring a lady here to have some fun. Therefore, her words weren't very astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Muyun Qingge heard the lady saying that she was Qing Shui's wife, she unconsciously looked toward Qing Shui. He wore a calm expression and didn't explain anything. It was true that there wasn't a need for them to explain such things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There weren't any seats near windows and thus, they found a seat that was slightly quieter. They ordered some dishes casually. After all, money wasn't an issue and they weren't here for the food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many people in the surroundings. Although this place was a very high class, it was still very lively. Those who didn't wish to be in the liveliness could find their own rooms. Those who stayed here all enjoyed the lively atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Qing Shui came here was in order to find some useful information. Of course, that was why they were dining in the lively hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Old Xiong, have you heard of a piece of news recently?" A middle-aged man looked toward a burly looking man and said.</span></p>
