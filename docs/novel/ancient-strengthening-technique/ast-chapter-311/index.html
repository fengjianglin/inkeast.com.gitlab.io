  <p><strong>AST 311 - Even An Ugly Daughter-In-Law Needs to Meet Her Parents-In-Law, Pure Gold Fishing Rod</strong></p>
  <p><span style>"You rascal, daring to have the evil intentions but not the courage to follow it through!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hearing this, Qing Shui's blood boiled. This demoness would always say things that gave him the urge to tear her clothes off and punish her right on the spot. Thinking of how he had still not succeed made Qing Shui feel very helpless, even though he had been aroused by her countless times since she knew how to pick the best locations. However, even when time passed, Qing Shui was not thick-skinned enough to peel off her clothes...</span></p>
  <p><span style>This time round, Qing Shui still felt very helpless, as Canghai Mingyue was around. Qing Shui did not know why he would be concerned over what this lady felt. He did not know if he loved the two of them, but he found it hard to throw them aside. It was like kinship, but yet something was different.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui did not deny that he was a player, but he was not promiscuous. He had a strong yearning towards beautiful ladies, but would tend to give them due consideration. Qing Shui longed for a life with multiple wives and concubines, but he could not find it in him to say it out to them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Letting out a sigh, he looked at Huoyun Liu-Li indecently as they headed for the back of the mountain amidst her pretty laughter. The afternoon sunlight casted long shadows for the three of them which occasionally overlapped each other. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Now in winter, many of the plants at the back of the mountain were bare, giving one the feeling of bleakness, lamenting how boundless the world is. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui and the two ladies walked on the mountain path, stepping on the dry leaves blown off the branches by the wind. Qing Shui felt that this moment was very calming, such that he could even feel that his heartbeat was much calmer than before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It might be because Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were also feeling the same thing, so the three of them did not say a word. Whoever they met on the road would look at Qing Shui with envy. With the beauties as companions, it was an extremely joyful feeling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, will you be representing Starmoon Hall in the competition between the various halls next year?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was not surprised that she would be asking this. After all, he had already defeated the Chief Disciple of the Starday Hall, so even if he wee to attend the competition between the various Chief Disciples, it would not be cause Gongsun Jianwu to lose face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He probably would not have a choice of whether he would be the one to go either.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Maybe. Elder Mo had once told me that the Palace Lord's intention to let me participate in it." Qing Shui chuckled, strolling around with the two ladies on the vast area at the back of the mountain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The fluctuating landscape made Qing Shui feel astonished at the majesty of Heavenly Palace Mountain, and of the mystery of the Creator of all living things. This towering mountain which was tens of thousands meters above sea-level, with stone steps cut into it, leading all the way to the peak. Just this process alone was a great project, forcibly cutting into the mountains.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I look forward to your performance on that day. It'll definitely be an eye-opener!" Canghai Mingyue smiled, but her black profound eyes were hiding a tinge of worry.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I actually am not very keen to participate in these events since my goal is not to defeat those Chief Disciples, nor is it to fight to become the top Chief Disciple. I just wish to live a normal life," Qing Shui said and let out a sigh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, Qing Shui's disposition, plus his tone, made him appear like a person who had been through a lot. He also had on a manly charm which was hard to describe; something which he only had after his disposition had changed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was not making a fuss without a cause. In his previous life, he was a stay-at-home nerd with no large ambitions, merely hoping that he would meet a lady he likes, have a simple family, to be with his parents, to have a pair of son and daughter in the future, have some money to spend. However, from the first day he came to this world, it was destined that this was just wishful thinking. </span></p>
  <p><span style>He had too many emotional burdens, which even if he were to put them down, he would not feel happy. It was why Qing Shui decided to topple that heavy mountain in his heart. Only then would he be able to live the simple life he wanted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>But after toppling it, Qing Shui knew that the simple life he wanted might have left him for good!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li saw Qing Shui's expression and knew what he was thinking of and did not know what to say. Rather than consoling him, they felt that it was better for them to remain quiet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, you promised that you would stay at the Heavenly Palace for three years. It hasn't been a year yet, you're not allowed to go back on your word," Canghai Mingyue said seriously, with an expression which was hard for others to tell what she was thinking about.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Three years, three years is too far off. Mingyue, I promise you that I'll stay here and spend next year's new year here. After that, I'll want to head home. I need to go back to do some preparation," Qing Shui replied, looking at Canghai Mingyue seriously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, let me go back with you. I miss home," Huoyun Liu-Li interrupted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her words 'I miss home' made Canghai Mingyue's eyes turn dull, her expression down crested. Qing Shui grabbed onto her hand, giving her a bit of warmth, while at the same time, letting her know that he was very concerned for her, and that he was there for her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Alright, Mingyue, do you want to stay here at the Heavenly Palace or go with me and Liu-Li to our area? It's quite a secluded area and is suitable for taking a break."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Huoyun Liu-Li also realized that she had spoken the wrong words. She quickly said, "That's right, elder sister can go back with me. We'll go visit Qing Shui's place. What do you think?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li was very clever, immediately changing the topic to a one with a flirtatious mood, making Canghai Mingyue feel as if she was visiting Qing Shui's family, admitting their relationship, or...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue looked a bit anxious, raising her head to look at Qing Shui, "Is it convenient?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her voice was very soft, but it made Qing Shui break out into a happy smile, "Even an ugly daughter-in-law would need to meet her parents-in-law, moreover Yueyue isn't an ugly daughter-in-law, of course I'd be happy if you could come." </span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, what rubbish are you talking about?" Canghai Mingyue pounded on Qing Shui's chest lightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at the rare embarrassed look she had on her face. He was used to her majestic and beautiful appearance that her current appearance gave him a tingling feeling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Then that settles it. After next year's new year, we set off."</span></p>
  <p><span style>The three of them started to chat about insignificant stuff. It may be because they had took paths which were more visible, they rarely came across lovebirds, and even if they did, they would just be kissing at most.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just a few meters away was a couple who seemed as if they had been separated by life and death, and were furiously sucking and biting each other's lips, their hands running over each other. But while their clothes were very messy, they were not baring skin.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was such a deep kiss that it was as if there were no one around them. Qing Shui looked at them with interest, while the two ladies lowered their heads and rushed Qing Shui to walk faster. The couple got a shock and quickly separated, smiling at Qing Shui and said, "Hi, Qing Shui!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Mmm mmm, hi. The two of you please continue, continue!" Qing Shui grinned, not expecting the other party to openly greet him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After walking for a short distance, they once again astonished a few other pairs of lovebirds who would all greeted Qing Shui warmly. There were even those who would throw suggestive looks towards him, saying that they would give up the spot for Qing Shui...</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the end, Qing Shui and the two ladies could only head back. Qing Shui guessed that it would be hard to have another chance to visit the back of the mountain anymore.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"How's the back of the mountain? Shall we join them next time?" Qing Shui smiled teasingly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"If you can get Sister Mingyue to agree, then I'll agree," Huoyun Liu-Li said slyly and blinked her seductive pair of eyes at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They walked slowly, and when they arrived back at Cang Wuya's residence, half the afternoon was already gone. Qing Shui felt that the day was a very fulfilling one, mentally.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just then the sound of footsteps came from outside, and then a loud voice rang out, "Brother Qing Shui is here, right?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fei Wuji chuckled. "Qing Shui, let's go out and take a look. See what 3rd Brother Hei has prepared for you as compensation."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled bitterly and nodded. Other than Cang Wuya, they all headed out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was a tanned man and five young men behind him, each of them holding on to a box. The boxes did not seem very big; they were long and flat, but one of them was bigger than the rest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Elder Fei, Brother Qing Shui, this is a token of my appreciation to thank Brother Qing Shui for going easy on me." 3rd Brother Hei said. He smiled then waved his hand.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The few men behind him who were carrying boxes came up to Qing Shui!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fei Wuji chuckled and then kept quiet. Qing Shui did not expect the Song Clan to really send gifts, but after giving it some thought, he understood the reason why. Song Lang was also an expert of Martial King level. When met with failures, he can stand up again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Brother Qing Shui can take a look to see if the gifts are to your liking," 3rd Brother Hei said with a smile.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at Fei Wuji, confused. The latter smiled and nodded.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked towards 3rd Brother Hei, smiled and nodded. He then walked towards the first box, reached out his hand to gradually open it. What appeared before him was a thousand-Year Rosa Laevigata[1]!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at the thousand-year medicinal herb. While the Rosa Laevigata was considered an ordinary medicinal herb, once it reaches thousand-year, it would be like a sparrow rising to the ranks of phoenixes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He also had some </span><span style>Rosa Laevigatas</span><span style> back in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, but they were still too young. Therefore, this thousand-year Rosa Laevigata was still quite good. At least it was something he could use.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Heading to the second box, Qing Shui opened it. What appeared before him was a rock that had a color which was a red as blood!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Red agate!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at its color, seeing that it was the size of a pigeon's egg and the sharp aura it exuded, he was certain that it should be a grade 3 one. Qing Shui was quite happy with it since it would be able to give him even more powers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Thinking about the black treasured stone, Qing Shui gradually closed the box, feeling that the red agate should be quite good. However, compared to the black treasured stone of the same grade, it should be slightly weaker. This world emphasized on agility and strength, and between the two, strength was more treasured.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was just that Qing Shui was stumped on whether a 3rd grade red agate could be mounted immediately. Mounting on weapons required digging of "holes", which would require "formations" and “Smelt Synthesis”.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui thought of how it would probably be hard to even open holes on the Big Dipper Sword, but the Heaven Shaking Hammer might be a good choice. After all, this weapon itself emphasized on strength.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui closed the lid. These two items were nothing to the Song Clan, but it was considered quite good for him, and the other three items would likely not be too shabby either. At least there should be one which was more presentable. Thinking about this, he opened the 3rd.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Fishing rod?" Qing Shui looked at the red colored fishing rod which was folded up and placed in the box. He felt that this fishing rod had a mysterious power, and was surprised at the fact that it looked exactly the same as the one in his imagination.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Pure Gold Fishing Rod!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was very agitated for once. The Pure Gold Fishing Rod was a mysterious fishing rod which was forged using the mysterious Purity Gold. It was said that the Pure Gold Fishing Rod could be use to catch some mysterious creatures. </span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Qing Shui did not understand why the Song Clan would give him this. Did they not know how precious this Pure Gold Fishing Rod was? Or did they not get anything after using this fishing rod?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had not heard of Pure Gold in this world. It was not really some fantastic material, just a very rare and mysterious type of metal. The fishing rod looked extremely beautiful. Was that the reason why it was given to him as a gift?</span></p>
  <p><span style>[1] </span><span style>Rosa Laevigata, the Cherokee rose, a white, fragrant </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>rose</span></a><span style> native to southern China and Taiwan south to Laos and Vietnam, and invasive in the United States.</span></p>

 <p><span style>It might be because Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were also feeling the same thing, so the three of them did not say a word. Whoever they met on the road would look at Qing Shui with envy. With the beauties as companions, it was an extremely joyful feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, will you be representing Starmoon Hall in the competition between the various halls next year?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was not surprised that she would be asking this. After all, he had already defeated the Chief Disciple of the Starday Hall, so even if he wee to attend the competition between the various Chief Disciples, it would not be cause Gongsun Jianwu to lose face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He probably would not have a choice of whether he would be the one to go either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Maybe. Elder Mo had once told me that the Palace Lord's intention to let me participate in it." Qing Shui chuckled, strolling around with the two ladies on the vast area at the back of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fluctuating landscape made Qing Shui feel astonished at the majesty of Heavenly Palace Mountain, and of the mystery of the Creator of all living things. This towering mountain which was tens of thousands meters above sea-level, with stone steps cut into it, leading all the way to the peak. Just this process alone was a great project, forcibly cutting into the mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I look forward to your performance on that day. It'll definitely be an eye-opener!" Canghai Mingyue smiled, but her black profound eyes were hiding a tinge of worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I actually am not very keen to participate in these events since my goal is not to defeat those Chief Disciples, nor is it to fight to become the top Chief Disciple. I just wish to live a normal life," Qing Shui said and let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Qing Shui's disposition, plus his tone, made him appear like a person who had been through a lot. He also had on a manly charm which was hard to describe; something which he only had after his disposition had changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was not making a fuss without a cause. In his previous life, he was a stay-at-home nerd with no large ambitions, merely hoping that he would meet a lady he likes, have a simple family, to be with his parents, to have a pair of son and daughter in the future, have some money to spend. However, from the first day he came to this world, it was destined that this was just wishful thinking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had too many emotional burdens, which even if he were to put them down, he would not feel happy. It was why Qing Shui decided to topple that heavy mountain in his heart. Only then would he be able to live the simple life he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after toppling it, Qing Shui knew that the simple life he wanted might have left him for good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li saw Qing Shui's expression and knew what he was thinking of and did not know what to say. Rather than consoling him, they felt that it was better for them to remain quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, you promised that you would stay at the Heavenly Palace for three years. It hasn't been a year yet, you're not allowed to go back on your word," Canghai Mingyue said seriously, with an expression which was hard for others to tell what she was thinking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Three years, three years is too far off. Mingyue, I promise you that I'll stay here and spend next year's new year here. After that, I'll want to head home. I need to go back to do some preparation," Qing Shui replied, looking at Canghai Mingyue seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, let me go back with you. I miss home," Huoyun Liu-Li interrupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words 'I miss home' made Canghai Mingyue's eyes turn dull, her expression down crested. Qing Shui grabbed onto her hand, giving her a bit of warmth, while at the same time, letting her know that he was very concerned for her, and that he was there for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, Mingyue, do you want to stay here at the Heavenly Palace or go with me and Liu-Li to our area? It's quite a secluded area and is suitable for taking a break."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Huoyun Liu-Li also realized that she had spoken the wrong words. She quickly said, "That's right, elder sister can go back with me. We'll go visit Qing Shui's place. What do you think?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li was very clever, immediately changing the topic to a one with a flirtatious mood, making Canghai Mingyue feel as if she was visiting Qing Shui's family, admitting their relationship, or...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue looked a bit anxious, raising her head to look at Qing Shui, "Is it convenient?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice was very soft, but it made Qing Shui break out into a happy smile, "Even an ugly daughter-in-law would need to meet her parents-in-law, moreover Yueyue isn't an ugly daughter-in-law, of course I'd be happy if you could come." </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, what rubbish are you talking about?" Canghai Mingyue pounded on Qing Shui's chest lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at the rare embarrassed look she had on her face. He was used to her majestic and beautiful appearance that her current appearance gave him a tingling feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then that settles it. After next year's new year, we set off."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them started to chat about insignificant stuff. It may be because they had took paths which were more visible, they rarely came across lovebirds, and even if they did, they would just be kissing at most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just a few meters away was a couple who seemed as if they had been separated by life and death, and were furiously sucking and biting each other's lips, their hands running over each other. But while their clothes were very messy, they were not baring skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was such a deep kiss that it was as if there were no one around them. Qing Shui looked at them with interest, while the two ladies lowered their heads and rushed Qing Shui to walk faster. The couple got a shock and quickly separated, smiling at Qing Shui and said, "Hi, Qing Shui!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mmm mmm, hi. The two of you please continue, continue!" Qing Shui grinned, not expecting the other party to openly greet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking for a short distance, they once again astonished a few other pairs of lovebirds who would all greeted Qing Shui warmly. There were even those who would throw suggestive looks towards him, saying that they would give up the spot for Qing Shui...</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Qing Shui and the two ladies could only head back. Qing Shui guessed that it would be hard to have another chance to visit the back of the mountain anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How's the back of the mountain? Shall we join them next time?" Qing Shui smiled teasingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you can get Sister Mingyue to agree, then I'll agree," Huoyun Liu-Li said slyly and blinked her seductive pair of eyes at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They walked slowly, and when they arrived back at Cang Wuya's residence, half the afternoon was already gone. Qing Shui felt that the day was a very fulfilling one, mentally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just then the sound of footsteps came from outside, and then a loud voice rang out, "Brother Qing Shui is here, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Wuji chuckled. "Qing Shui, let's go out and take a look. See what 3rd Brother Hei has prepared for you as compensation."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled bitterly and nodded. Other than Cang Wuya, they all headed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a tanned man and five young men behind him, each of them holding on to a box. The boxes did not seem very big; they were long and flat, but one of them was bigger than the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Elder Fei, Brother Qing Shui, this is a token of my appreciation to thank Brother Qing Shui for going easy on me." 3rd Brother Hei said. He smiled then waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The few men behind him who were carrying boxes came up to Qing Shui!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Wuji chuckled and then kept quiet. Qing Shui did not expect the Song Clan to really send gifts, but after giving it some thought, he understood the reason why. Song Lang was also an expert of Martial King level. When met with failures, he can stand up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Brother Qing Shui can take a look to see if the gifts are to your liking," 3rd Brother Hei said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at Fei Wuji, confused. The latter smiled and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked towards 3rd Brother Hei, smiled and nodded. He then walked towards the first box, reached out his hand to gradually open it. What appeared before him was a thousand-Year Rosa Laevigata[1]!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at the thousand-year medicinal herb. While the Rosa Laevigata was considered an ordinary medicinal herb, once it reaches thousand-year, it would be like a sparrow rising to the ranks of phoenixes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also had some </span><span style>Rosa Laevigatas</span><span style> back in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, but they were still too young. Therefore, this thousand-year Rosa Laevigata was still quite good. At least it was something he could use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heading to the second box, Qing Shui opened it. What appeared before him was a rock that had a color which was a red as blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red agate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at its color, seeing that it was the size of a pigeon's egg and the sharp aura it exuded, he was certain that it should be a grade 3 one. Qing Shui was quite happy with it since it would be able to give him even more powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about the black treasured stone, Qing Shui gradually closed the box, feeling that the red agate should be quite good. However, compared to the black treasured stone of the same grade, it should be slightly weaker. This world emphasized on agility and strength, and between the two, strength was more treasured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that Qing Shui was stumped on whether a 3rd grade red agate could be mounted immediately. Mounting on weapons required digging of "holes", which would require "formations" and “Smelt Synthesis”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui thought of how it would probably be hard to even open holes on the Big Dipper Sword, but the Heaven Shaking Hammer might be a good choice. After all, this weapon itself emphasized on strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui closed the lid. These two items were nothing to the Song Clan, but it was considered quite good for him, and the other three items would likely not be too shabby either. At least there should be one which was more presentable. Thinking about this, he opened the 3rd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fishing rod?" Qing Shui looked at the red colored fishing rod which was folded up and placed in the box. He felt that this fishing rod had a mysterious power, and was surprised at the fact that it looked exactly the same as the one in his imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pure Gold Fishing Rod!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was very agitated for once. The Pure Gold Fishing Rod was a mysterious fishing rod which was forged using the mysterious Purity Gold. It was said that the Pure Gold Fishing Rod could be use to catch some mysterious creatures. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Qing Shui did not understand why the Song Clan would give him this. Did they not know how precious this Pure Gold Fishing Rod was? Or did they not get anything after using this fishing rod?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had not heard of Pure Gold in this world. It was not really some fantastic material, just a very rare and mysterious type of metal. The fishing rod looked extremely beautiful. Was that the reason why it was given to him as a gift?</span></p>
