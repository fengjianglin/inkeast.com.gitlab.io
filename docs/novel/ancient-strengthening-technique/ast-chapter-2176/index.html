 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An explanation? What explanation? You took Lord Dong’s lands, killed his people, and when he came to discuss that, you killed him without a thought. What explanation do you need?” The dark-skinned man laughed as he said this. It was a laughter that was unpleasant to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a black shark and he seemed to be a head and responsible for the place, which meant that he could have contact with people above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason why I killed his people was because they were going to kill me first. When you said that he was supposedly going to ask me for my reasons, he tried to fool around with my women instead. If there was someone who was trying to do that to you, what would you do?” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Try to fool around with my women? I’d kill them…” After saying this, the large man seemed to feel a little off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t that right? As a result, I killed him, but I still didn’t feel that great. I didn’t know what he was playing at, coming to fool around with my women, saying that he was of the Water Dragon Gate. I had to come and discuss this with you guys. Else, I would destroy this place.” Qing Shui angrily said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Destroy the Water Dragon Gate? Young man, you’re too confident for your own good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a thick voice sounded out and a man who seemed to be around the age of an old man came. He was tall and strong, extraordinary, and emanated an unnaturally threatening aura. He looked at Qing Shui, neither angry nor amused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Left Vice Sect Leader!” The dark skinned man cried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who seemed to be the Left Vice Sect Leader waved his hand, telling them that they could leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whether I match up to what I say, that will be apparent later. All I want is an explanation.” Qing Shui repeated his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, you’re just making bogus accusations. It doesn’t matter who was right or wrong, since you have come unscathed. In addition, you have come here, who had lost Dong and the others, and you still want an explanation?” the man looked at Qing Shui with the same emotionless look that he had previously, and said this calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui found that what this man said was true. Normally, no matter what, the people directly involved were dead and the situation should be resolved. However, he had come with an agenda today, so he naturally couldn’t leave it at that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seeing how that Lord Dong of yours acted, I was wondering what type of people you guys were here so I don’t know whether you would go into ruin, and wanted to resolve what I came here for quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s also what I was thinking of. Although we here at the Water Dragon Gate aren’t some kind of super sect, we also aren’t one that other people can easily harass. You guys wanted to find a place, but the Beiyun River was already occupied. By staying there after beating the original owner, you have harassed them. Don’t even talk about your women being fooled around with. Taking someone else’s land is just the same. In this way, you’re just a bully who’s using his strength to justify his actions.” The man criticized Qing Shui’s actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t that Qing Shui didn’t know that, but at that time he still wanted to make them compensate him. However, they weren’t falling for it. “Before that happened, I wanted to talk about that matter, or even exchange items. He didn’t give me that opportunity, and wanted to kill me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“None of those are reasons. At the start, you were already planning on using your strength and perhaps even be a pirate. Don’t make yourself look like some good-natured man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had nothing to say. He was berated, but that didn’t mean that he was going to become a prostitute to his reasoning...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve been talking about this for a while. Why don’t we just talk with our fists? You guys here at the Water Dragon Gate aren’t the best people either. What do you say to a duel?” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Then we shall have a bout. If you win, I will give you anything.” The man agreed to Qing Shui’s duel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then if I lose?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you lose, then you must apologize to the little Dong,” the man said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui cursed in his heart. This sly fox wanted him to apologize to that person if he lost, which was basically just asking him to pay for the funeral. If they lost, they would give him something, but that would serve as a reminder of what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui also had his own plans and said after some thought: “Where did that Dong person rank in the Water Dragon Gate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He was one of the two thousand brothers, nothing special.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing that, Qing Shui felt that they were boasting. He knew that the Nine-Headed Mystic Snake was slightly strong, and this family also had many people in it, which wasn’t fake. In this way, just sacrificing one of them shouldn’t have been such a big deal, especially when he wasn’t that special anyways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a plan in his heart, nodded his head: “Then let’s begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roooooarrrr...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man summoned a large Nine-Headed Mystic Snake, just like the one he had seen on the sculpture. Its large body coiled around, watching the tiny Qing Shui, as though it were a giant looking at its prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Woosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A powerful current built up around, as strong as the current at a delta. It terrifyingly churned indiscriminately. This was something that could be achieved by the best of the water casters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood in the middle of the current, strong as Taishan, then walked up step by step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cloud of black foggy smoke poured out like water onto the current, tainting the entire body of water with a thin, bubbly layer, like a boiled kettle of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Primordial Flame Dragon Whip!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The whip extended over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Snake Elephant’s Movement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It then fiercely cracked on the large snake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s attack wasn’t that strong, but now that his realm was not too bad, being halfway to Divine Connection, this one crack had already left a large, deep mark on the snake that was spitting out fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui really didn’t think much of this Left Vice Sect Leader, knowing that his strength wasn’t even close to Qing Shui. Qing Shui didn’t dare use Stellar Transposition or the Nine Continents Mountain, lest he killed that person in one attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He threw the whip a few more times before finally stopping when his opponent admitted defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s face was unnatural, his clothes ragged. The way he was looking at Qing Shui was also pretty weird. Qing Shui’s strength was way too much, easily beating him to this position. He could even feel that Qing Shui wasn’t using his full strength.</span></p>

Seeing how young this man was, the man guessed that he must have come from the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain, or the mainland there.</span></p>

What are you going to say? If you’re not in a position to be the leader, I’ll find your superior,” Qing Shui said.</span></p>

Then they will return to the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain. Let them stay there for that period. Another thing is that they are not to be disturbed during their stay. I’m not afraid to say that destroying the Water Dragon Gate is as easy as it is for me to flick my hand. Whether you want to believe that or not is up to you. Just know that if my women are disturbed during their stay, I will find you and the Water Dragon Gate. I will show no mercy when that time comes.”</span></p>
