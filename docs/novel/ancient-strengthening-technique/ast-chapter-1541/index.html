 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Poison Dragon's Sure Kill Heavenly Technique was quite powerful. If it weren't for Qing Shui as well as Qin Qing and the Dragon Slaying Beast being immune to the poison, there probably wouldn't have been much of a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thanks to the Paragon Golden Armor, Qing Shui wasn't injured at all. The Dragon Slaying Beast was the same, but Qin Qing, because of the black clouds or some other reason, had become pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How is it? Are you alright?" Qing Shui grabbed her hand and made his Nature’s Energy circulate through her body once to dilute the black clouds which had entered her body. Her complexion also recovered after that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Better now. That black fog is quite terrible." Qin Qing said and pulled Qing Shui away from the Poison Dragon, which was dashing towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a little troubled. The Sure Kill Heavenly Technique had already used the ability of his Paragon Golden Armor, and it was unknown how many times the Poison Dragon before their eyes could use the Sure Kill Heavenly Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Poison Dragon strength, it definitely had a few Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques, only some of which were passive. Its genuine trump cards were few in number, and they would deplete with each one it used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed by slowly. Without the Dragon Slaying Beast in the lead, the two of them wouldn't have been able to endure. In this period of time, Qing Shui had used many of the objects he possessed to block the Poison Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't dare bring out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the Hellfire Phoenix , or the Hell Nightmare Beast, as the Poison Dragon's poison was truly terrible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Hellfire Phoenix were of the Dragon and Phoenix species respectively. The Hellfire Phoenix's bloodline had already reached the "Strong" mark, and it could typically easily resist poison. The Hellfire Phoenix in particular was strong in that regard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since it was this way, Qing Shui also didn't waste much time thinking and directly brought the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the Hellfire Phoenix, and the Hell Nightmare Beast out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hell Nightmare Beast was a super-strong Shield Beast. If it was facing the Poison Dragon's terrifying and robust attacks, it could resist them and wouldn't go flying away. This made Qing Shui relax his breath for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed by, the light on the Poison Dragon disappeared, and its strength declined by a large margin, making its strength and speed return to what it was before when it was weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled happily. The time period of the Poison Dragon's Sure Kill Heavenly Technique had ended. Qing Shui thought of his own ability, and if this Poison Dragon wasn't weakened and had used the Sure Kill Heavenly Technique for a second time, that terrible speed and strength weren't something Qin Qing and he could resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui brought the Thunderous Beast out as the Poison Dragon's speed had dropped greatly. He could let the Thunderous Beast display its skills without worrying about it getting insta-killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Palace Laws, Nine Continents Mountain, and the Hell Nightmare Beast were already enough for the Thunderous Beast to hide from the Poison Dragon's deadly chase as it attacked, causing thunderbolts to drop on the Poison Dragon's body one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing also left several wounds on the Poison Dragon's body in the meantime. Although each was tiny, they kept piling up, and these wounds wouldn't heal in the short term.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out the Soulshake Bell at this time. He wasn't planning to injure the Poison Dragon, but rather he hoped to threaten it. The current Soulshake Bell hadn't escalated again after reaching the 9th Level, but the divine energy within it was a lot more, and it could be shaken several times more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the time the Soulshake Bell's ringing sounded out, it was clearly visible that the Poison Dragon's body shuddered. After reaching the 9th Level, the Soulshake Bell didn't seem that unpleasant to a human’s ears, but instead sounded quite sweet-sounding. Merely, it appeared quite terrible to Demonic Beasts, making them tremble in fear, just like a human looking at the most terrifying existence in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Human, why did you invade my territory?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold metallic voice echoed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't marvelled by hearing the voice. Even if the Poison Dragon opened its mouth to speak, it was quite reasonable. Qing Shui only felt that it was too late for it to talk now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do we need a reason?" Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing looked at this unreasonable man. There was no need to say any reason as such was the relationship between humankind and demonic beasts, fighting with each other for all time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Perhaps you'll defeat me, but you'll have to pay a disastrous price for it. Why don't we discuss this?" The cold voice echoed out once again as it evaded Qin Qing and the other demonic beasts' attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Acknowledge me as your master and become my demonic beast, or else there's nothing to discuss." Qing Shui said directly without stopping his attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ignorant. It seems there's no room for discussion. Let me have you taste my Dragon race's Taboo Battle Skill."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt the surrounding spiritual qi crazily converge towards the Poison Dragon. Qing Shui had no intention of finding out what this Poison Dragon's strongest battle skill was, so he made the Thunderous Beast use Purple Lightning Strike to prevent it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple Lightning Strike...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thunderous Beast's Purple Lightning Strike kept attacking, and the Dragon Slaying Beast had set out long ago as well. Qing Shui had plenty of assurance that he could defeat it. Even if he couldn't, Qin Qing could use the Nine Continents Steps to quickly leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puchi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast drilled into that huge black eye. As for Qing Shui, he attacked from the outside. Gathering Nature’s Energy, the Golden Battle Halberd directly struck at the location of the Poison Dragon's reverse scale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's Nature Energy entered the Poison Dragon's body. As the purest qi in the world, it began to wreak havoc inside the Poison Dragon's body as soon as it entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps Qing Shui's attack wasn't absolutely fatal, but it undoubtedly inflicted massive injuries. The Dragon Slaying Beast's attack nevertheless was the deadliest. It had directly pierced into the Poison Dragon's head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roooaarrrr...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Poison Dragon howled painfully in despair. This voice didn't last long and quickly came to an end. There was no need to doubt the Dragon Slaying Beast's destructive nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The giant Poison Dragon fell to the ground, and the Dragon Slaying Beast came out of its body. Its body wasn't contaminated by even a single bloodstain. Qing Shui had seen how every time the Dragon Slaying Beast made the best of an opportunity. This little thing's might was really domineering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast's size was already as big as an elephant, but Qing Shui felt it was still that small thing, resembling the Treasure Hunting Pig from that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qin Qing retrieved her long-sword. She still felt like this was an illusionary dream. All the demonic beasts this man possessed had powerful skills. That purple Thunderous Beast's ability was extraordinarily terrifying and matched together with the Dragon Slaying Beast; they were simply an unparalleled pair. If they were given the time to mature, they'd be able to kill existences which surpassed them by several times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smacked his lips as he looked at Qin Qing: "Isn't it quite a pleasant sensation?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing glared at him. When he heard Qing Shui's roguelike speech, she couldn't help but glare at him. &nbsp;Qing Shui noticed her expression and realized that his words were quite ambiguous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're overthinking, I just wanted to see whether you had felt a sensation of accomplishment." Qing Shui giggled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're the one overthinking!" Qin Qing stated helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes, yes. I'm the one overthinking. I also didn't have any other choice. It's pitiful that you don't overthink. Humans eh... It's very natural for them to think about food... and... sex."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing firmly shut her mouth and didn't try to reason with him. The more she did, the more shameless he became.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at her expression and laughed, walking towards the giant Poison Dragon. This Poison Dragon was too big. Qing Shui waved his hand, and one huge white fog enveloped it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Poison Dragon disappeared after that. He looked at Qin Qing, "I'll take this away first and divide some good things for you later."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't want any. What good things can that Poison Dragon's body have?" Qin Qing shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Let’s go. How about we take a look at the place where the Poison Dragon Flower is?" Qing Shui didn't waste time with her question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before leaving, Qing Shui first transplanted the flowers, plants, and trees away. Qin Qing looked at this greedy man and shook her head helplessly. These things were excellent, and it'd be pretty unfortunate if an Alchemist couldn't take them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's actions this time were swifter. He and Qin Qing walked together towards the direction the Poison Dragon had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many valuable medicinal herbs appeared on the ground from time to time. Qing Shui took them as he passed by, and the speed at which he gathered them was quick. Passing through a mountain stream, a giant mountain pool appeared before their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spirit Pool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them looked at the snow-white liquid that was emitting an intense, pure spirit qi. It was no wonder why many valuable herbs grew and the Poison Dragon had made its nest here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the center of this water pool, Qing Shui noticed a huge, pitch-black colored flower. It seemed quite imposing in that snow-white Spirit Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unusual bewitchment, enticement and several kinds of fatal sensations came from it. Qing Shui never knew that a flower would grow up to become like this. He wasn't a flower person, but he had to admit that this flower was indeed quite pretty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, if this flower were merely an ordinary pretty flower, its value would be less, but this was a Poison Dragon Flower. Qing Shui currently felt like taking this thing away from here, not even sparing the Spirit Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll go in then. What's mine is also yours. How about I divide it with you after the Poison Dragon Flower is refined into medicinal pills?" Qing Shui said so, but his hands had already begun to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew Qin Qing wouldn't say anything, but he still said this to tease her...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui first digged a pool similar to the one outside in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and then directly moved the Spirit Pool inside it. Moving it was also pretty easy as he used the enlarged Primordial Demon Refining Furnace to move it inside...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just doing all this wasted a reasonable amount of time. By the time Qing Shui finished moving the Poison Dragon Flower into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the day had already grown slightly dark. Qing Shui looked around and found a cave-dwelling at a region not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's stay here for a night and move on tomorrow!" Qing Shui looked towards that huge cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mhm!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Poison Dragon Flower hadn't matured yet, but it would soon. This Poison Dragon's luck was pretty bad. It had lost the Poison Dragon Flower and even its own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't dark inside the cave dwelling. There were quite a few luminous pearls fitted in the cold cave walls and although it couldn't be compared to daytime, it was bright enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The width of the cave wasn't something an ordinary human could imagine, as the Poison Dragon's body was quite massive. A small cave dwelling wasn't realistic. The cave was massive and circular, but the odor inside was quite fresh and had quite the proper air ventilation. Plus, this place also had the purification of the Spirit Pool, so there wouldn't be any unpleasant odor here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many things here including weapons, armours, and many skins of demonic beasts, most of which were of high grade. Except for a few demonic beast materials and medicinal herbs, the armor, weapons, and other stuff couldn't enter Qing Shui's eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he had already obtained the Poison Dragon's most precious treasures: the Poison Dragon Flower, the Spirit Pool, and those medicinal herbs which were more than 10,000 years old. Additionally, the Poison Dragon's body itself was a treasure. Therefore, although the things inside the cave-dwelling weren't that good, there was no sense of disappointment. After resting for a night, he planned to look at the nearby areas again to check if they missed anything.</span></p>
