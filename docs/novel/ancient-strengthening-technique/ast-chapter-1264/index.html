 <p><strong>AST 1264 - Finally Encountering Di Chen, She Is Still Herself (teaser)</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again stayed behind in the Imperial City for a few more days. During this time, he consumed the Swift Agile Pill. This pill increased both the offensive speed and the normal speed of the consumer by 50%. He felt really satisfied with it.</p>
 <p>Summing them up, Qing Shui’s speed had already increased abruptly by a few folds. Hence, his strength would also experience a significant increase. Sometimes, the strength increased due to speed wouldn’t be shown directly but as for its ability to deal damage, it would increase tremendously. For example, his current Nine Continents Mountain attacked the target with two times of both his speed and strength. If it had been three or four times of his speed, its power would have been even more terrifying.</p>
 <p>This time, considering that his raw speed increased by multiple folds, it would cause the power of his Nine Continents Mountain to become significantly more powerful. Its prowess wasn’t something which could be compared to that from before. This was also part of the reasons why Qing Shui was willing to help Fu Rong refine the Swift Agile Pill.</p>
 <p>This was given by Fu Rong out of her own free will. Or rather, it was given by her for long-term plans. Even if she hadn’t been willing to give it to him, he would still think of a way to get one or two pills from her. After all, speed was just too important to a warrior.</p>
 <p>Time was almost up. New year was also approaching. Qing Shui immediately used the Nine Continents Steps Effect and flew into the direction towards the Hu Clan. He hoped that Di Chen would appear, he felt both excited and worried to see her.</p>
 <p>It had been slightly more than one year since he came to the Western Oxhe Continent. He had been quite satisfied with his current speed. If it wasn’t because he was aware of the strength in the Western Oxhe Continent, Qing Shui wouldn’t have considered his long travel time to be fast. Nevertheless, he had already regarded himself as being very lucky right now.</p>
 <p>It was already a few days later by the time he arrived at the area where the Hu Clan was located in. By the time he reached there, he was naturally welcomed with open hands. Qing Shui on the other hand, noticed that there was now another girl.</p>
 <p>The girl was really beautiful and looked similar to Hu Yiya. Compared to her, she looked more mature and fresh. Her eyes were curved slightly upwards at the end, which made her looked a bit charming. However, with the lotus attire across her body, it caused her charmingness to become even fainter.</p>
 <p>Hu Yiqian!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui assumed that this girl was Hu Yiqian, the girl from the Lotus Sect! Qing Shui managed to sense a familiar aura from her body.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, here, let me introduce her to you. She is my sister, Hu Yiqian. I never expected for her to come back this year. Furthermore, she came back so early.” Hu Yiya said happily.</p>
 <p>“Nice to meet you!”</p>
 <p>“Nice to meet you too!” Qing Shui politely greeted her back.</p>
 <p>“I have already heard things regarding Mr. Qing. Sister Zhisha will help you with your stuffs. It will be a lot better compared to me helping you.” Hu Yiqian said straightforwardly.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I still have to thank you guys. If not for Sister Min taking me to Miss Diwu, I think I won’t even know who to look for to seek help.” Qing Shui was telling the truth.</p>
 <p>“You are welcome. This is a strength belonging to yourself. Even without us or the Diwu Clan, no one is really capable of stopping you for now.” Hu Yiqian said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Hu Yiqian spoke really highly of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh yes, is Miss Diwu back yet?” Actually, Qing Shui had been wanting to ask Hu Yiqian this question upon his arrival.</p>
 <p>“It should be quite soon now. At most, she should be back within three days.” Hu Yiqian said in a certain tone.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing these words, Qing Shui felt a lot steadier. The only thing he didn’t know was whether Di Chen would show up. Back then when she left, even Qing Shui himself didn’t know about the situation. Unknowingly, they had already been separated for around eight years.</p>
 <p>As he thought about all of this, he felt a bit sad. Since his lifespan had increased, eight years here weren’t really anything. But all in all, Qing Shui’s mind was still stopped at the concept from his previous incarnation. Eight years, in his previous incarnation, how many eight years could a person have to be at their most perfect age? How many people could possibly stand eight years of being separated from their loved ones?</p>
 <p>By merely asking a few questions, Qing Shui already knew that the Lotus Sect didn’t really leak out their information to the outside world. Hence, he also stopped to inquire about the sect itself. Even Diwu Zhisha herself also refused to tell him about it, let alone Hu Yiqian.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui wanted to meet them in person as he was reluctant to wait for three days. Unfortunately, he didn’t know the direction there. Furthermore, it seemed they had a specialized route they took to travel back and forth to the Lotus Sect. Hence, he had no choice but to give up on this idea.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lived through the the three days in torment. Early in the morning on the third day, he was already high up in the sky as he looked around the entire place. He had never expected himself to be so impatient now. If Di Chen didn’t show up, he felt that he might not be able to withstand that kind of feeling. If she didn’t really show up, he wondered if he would force Diwu Zhisha and Hu Yimin to spill out the location of the Lotus Sect.</p>
 <p>It was just like a couple who loved each other from his previous incarnation, who promised each other to meet up today after half a year and the feeling they harbored when they were waiting for each other to show up. Qing Shui stood in the sky as he waited. He had been doing so since early up in the morning until the sun rose.</p>
 <p>Was this the third day? Qing Shui didn’t know if Hu Yiqian meant the fourth day when she mentioned three days later.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never realized that he had so little patience. It was as if he couldn’t even wait for a day.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Qing Shui stared at the south. There was a black spot which was advancing towards here at a really high speed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt unusual and the blood in his heart was also boiling. Without much thought, he immediately activated his Nine Continents Steps Effect and instantly appeared not far in front of the black spot.</p>
 <p>At the moment Qing Shui spotted the enormous Blue Luan, he felt fired up. Even though it had been a long time since he last saw it, he could still confirm that this was the Blue Luan owned by Di Chen.</p>
 <p>It was just that compared to before, the Blue Luan was way bigger now. Similarly, the aura it emitted was also a lot stronger.</p>
 <p>This was the same kind of demonic beast as Qing Shui’s Fire Bird. Hence, it would have enormous hidden potential within its body. Of course, the gap now between Blue Luan and Qing Shui’s Fire Bird was too large. It was inferior to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant even though the gap wasn’t actually as big. This caused Qing Shui to feel really shocked. It seemed that the Blue Luan also had some unusual encounters here.</p>
 <p>He quickly looked towards the two figure on top of the Blue Luan. One of them was Diwu Zhisha. Qing Shui didn’t settle down his sight there. He immediately looked towards the other woman.</p>
 <p>At the moment when he saw the figure, a feeling of familiarity emerged deep down from his heart. The eagerness he felt from before seemed as if they had been irrigated and turned into the current enormous surprise.</p>
 <p>This was the figure which he had thought all day and night. It was precisely the one which he had been pursuing since he arrived in the Western Oxhe Continent. A profound yet graceful aura surrounded around her body as they emitted powerful life force.</p>
 <p>Di Chen!</p>
 <p>Like usual, she still wore snow white imperial robes. Her hair was tied in a bun and it had a phoenix hairpin stuck in it, giving people the feeling like she was untainted by even a speck of dust.</p>
 <p>Just like before, her face was still covered by a snow-white veil. The only part of her face exposed was the black yet extraordinarily beautiful pair of her eyes.</p>
 <p>She shared a bit of the momentum as well as gorgeousness which Canghai Mingyue had and also the extraordinary and unique feeling which belonged to that of Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>Compared to before, Di Chen looked almost the same. However, the feeling she gave Qing Shui changed and felt a bit strange. Despite so, it wasn’t as distant as he had thought.</p>
 <p>“Thank you Miss Diwu. Later on, Chen`Er and I will visit you in your house. I will definitely pay you back with great rewards.” Qing Shui smiled and told Diwu Zhisha.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. You cured me. If you’re to really argue over it, I feel like I’m the one who earned more. I will welcome you to my house at anytime. For now, I’ll take my leave first.” Diwu Zhisha said with a smile. After that, she nodded at Di Chen and left.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Di Chen and slowly approached her. From the time they met each other until now, he hadn’t heard Di Chen said anything. But from her eyes, he could see a bit of contradiction in it.</p>
 <p>“You only left behind a note. I felt abandoned.” Qing Shui explained with a smile. By now, he had already walked up next to her.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a bit uncomfortable when he heard her called his name this time. Like usual, her voice still sounded like the voice of buddha, it still sounded as natural as ever. But compared to before, the way she called out to him sounded really awkward.</p>
 <p>After all, it had been so long since she last mentioned this name.</p>
 <p>“I was really afraid that you might have forgotten about me. By the time I figured out you’re here, I made haste to come here. But I soon realized that I wasn’t strong enough. Hence, the only thing I could do was cultivate hard. I still needed to arrange all the things back at home. I am scared that when I’m gone, other people will lay their hands on the Qing Clan. So I ended up strengthening everyone from the clan as well. At last, I managed to settle everything nicely before I came here.” Qing Shui explained slowly.</p>
 <p>While Qing Shui was speaking, the expression on Di Chen’s face changed. She came from the other five continents. She was already aware that Qing Shui was still too weak at that time to able to come to this place. But as it turned out, he still came here for her in the end.</p>
 <p>Actually, ever since Di Chen arrived here, her grade had already reached a stable state. The situation brought forth by her violent increase in strength had begun to weaken slowly. After all, there were still quite a lot of people here who were more powerful than her. While she listened to Qing Shui, her eyes slowly looked more calm.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui saw her reaction. However, he only stopped for a while before he continued: “Even though I dare not say that I’m invincible there, but so far, I haven’t seen anyone who is able to stand against me. Who knew that I was nothing here and nor was I able to receive any information about you.That kind of unsettling feeling……is something you can never imagine, I was also scared that you might not recognize me when I see you and might end up killing me. Hence, the only thing I could do was to cultivate like mad so that if you happened to not recognize me by then, I would just snatch you away by force. Don’t you ever think about running away from me in your entire life. You are my woman.”</p>
 <p>“How would I not recognize you? Don’t even mention about killing you.” Di Chen said gently. The corner of her eyes looked a bit wet. There was also a faint smile on her face, and also a bit of heartache. She felt really conflicted.</p>
 <p>He gathered up his courage and went on to approach her. He held her white hands with both of his hands. Qing Shui’s mind was really calm. He looked at her without blinking even once. It was as if he wanted to make up for everything within this short period of time.</p>
 <p>Di Chen let him held her hands as he pleased. It was because she was really afraid of the feelings from before that was why she decided to leave. As time passed by, the figure in her heart got clearer and clear and a sense of familiarity beckoned to her.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the Lotus Sect doesn’t allow their disciples to get married.”</p>
 <p>“I heard that it’s allowed to do so.” Qing Shui said without much care. Seeing Di Chen like this, he felt relieved. It seemed that she didn’t forget about him, at least for now, she hadn’t. It might feel awkward at first but very quickly, they managed to recover back to like how they used to be around each other.</p>
 <p>“For normal disciples to get married, they’ll have to leave the Lotus Sect.” Di Chen said softly.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, why don’t you leave the sect as well? Following me will definitely be better than staying in the Lotus Sect.” Actually, Qing Shui disliked it when a particular sect restricted their disciples from doing this and that.</p>
