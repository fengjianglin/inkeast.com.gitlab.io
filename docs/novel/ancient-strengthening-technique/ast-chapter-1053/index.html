 <p><strong>AST 1053 - Ghostly Hypnosis Call，Ghostly Qi Devouring，Netherworld Formation</strong></p>
 <p>When the Old Ancestor brought up his uncle, he sounded exceptionally proud of him. Qing Shui suddenly realized why Wen Jing mentioned that even the leader of Ghost Sect had to treat the Wen Clan with respect. That must be the reason.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was shocked to hear that the Old Ancestor’s uncle had come back from the Four Continents to retire. Perhaps that man doesn’t have many years left...how strong is he anyway?</p>
 <p>At the moment, Qing Shui found the Four Continents quite scary. Luckily, once a person returned from the Four Continents, they were limited by the laws of the earth. However, he still did not wish to meet anyone from the Four Continents.</p>
 <p>“Old sir, how powerful is the Wen Clan in the other Four Continents?” Before he asked this question, Qing Shui had a startled look on his face. Even though he was really shocked, he did not find the need to hide his emotion.</p>
 <p>Naturally, the Old Ancestor felt pleased when he saw Qing Shui’s expression. Everyone acted the same way since having a relative of that level was an honor and something to be proud of.</p>
 <p>“The Wen Clan holds an average position in the other Four Continents. But the other Four Continents are much wealthier and the cultivators are stronger… I don’t want to elaborate on this subject because it is beyond your comprehension.” The Old Ancestor seemed to long for that place, perhaps even reminisced about the place. Qing Shui had a strong feeling that the old man must have been there before.</p>
 <p>“Old Sir, if your clan is bullied here, for example if your entire clan was annihilated by someone, will the people from the Wen Clan of the other Four Continents send people here for revenge?” Qing Shui asked after thinking about it for a few seconds.</p>
 <p>He had finished asking his three questions and so far he had found out a few things. Now, he was very interested in the last answer. He could see that the Old Ancestor of the Wen Clan had a slightly moody expression.</p>
 <p>“There are not many people in the Five Continents who can annihilate my Wen Clan. Even so, they will not decide to do so hastily, because they will pay a high price. However, if we really are annihilated by others, then it’ll just prove our incompetence. The Wen Clan from the other Four Continents will never seek revenge in the Five Continents. It is a sort of pact. People from the Four Continents are strictly prohibited to abuse their power here in the Five Continents. However, if those enemies decide to travel to the other Four Continents, that would be a different matter.”</p>
 <p>Perhaps, the Old Ancestor of the Wen Clan did not consider Qing Shui a threat at all, therefore he actually answered Qing Shui patiently. This was the first time that he had done something like that even though he would be unable to justify his own action. It could just be because he saw Qing Shui’s unique constitution.</p>
 <p>“Old Sir, thank you for telling me all that,” Qing Shui thanked the old man sincerely.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to thank me. The answers are what you get in exchange for your life. They are what you deserve.” The Old Ancestor looked at Qing Shui calmly.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Then I won’t stand on ceremony.”</p>
 <p>“Will you kill yourself or do you want me to do it?” the Old Ancestor said stiffly with his weather-worn voice while watching Qing Shui. His words were cold and they possessed an unquestionable intensity — a mannerism of an expert cultivator.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to die, so you will have to snatch my life away from me, old sir!” Qing Shui took out his Formation Flags and starting throwing them. They stuck to each spot he targeted.</p>
 <p>In the beginning, the Old Ancestor was very doubtful of Qing Shui’s ability. However, the old man quickly realized that things were not going well. His expression was immediately replaced with shock and anger. “Set up the formation!”</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor was suddenly aware that he might have underestimated the young man. The main reason was because Qing Shui looked very young. But he was very confident that even a super genius would not be able to flip the tables.</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor knew about formations, even his own clan had a few, so he quickly recognized that Qing Shui was setting up a formation. He knew how insanely powerful formations could be, therefore they had to stop Qing Shui. When he remembered Qing Shui’s last question, he somehow felt uneasy.</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor took out his Black Onyx Trident. Pushing his feet against the floor he propelled himself towards Qing Shui in a demonic fashion as the others fell into their formation positions. In an instant, the entire scene became a battleground, but it had not reached the stage of non-stop exchange between the parties.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Free Spirit Roaming Steps！</p>
 <p>In a fleeting, elegant, unpredictable movement, Qing Shui moved closer to the Old Ancestor, as he simultaneously threw out his Formation Flags. The Old Ancestor was now feeling slightly anxious, he did not expect the young fellow to move so quickly.</p>
 <p>Phantasmic Triplicate Steps!</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor instantly split into three figures. Two of the figures attacked Qing Shui from behind, while one of them attacked him head-on. The three silhouettes were extremely fast, they each left a heavy trail of Yin Qi in their path, and that dark aura was spreading rapidly throughout the hall.</p>
 <p>Buddha's True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Pak! Pak!</p>
 <p>With two loud sounds, the two fake decoys shattered.</p>
 <p>Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui launched his Great Golden Buddha Palm directly at the last real figure!</p>
 <p>Pak!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw his Buddha Palm attack utterly destroyed by the old man but Qing Shui had already finished placing the last Formation Flag. He finally felt some relief. Even if there was an unexpected situation, he could always enter the formation.</p>
 <p>As he did not have much time, Qing Shui used his Duality Minutest Formation!</p>
 <p>Descending Heavens Talisman！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very cautious but he was calm. His Nine Palace Steps had reached a mature stage and when he placed down his Descending Heavens Talisman, he clicked his tongue.</p>
 <p>Over 1000 stars!</p>
 <p>The old man’s strength was actually over 200,000 stars, almost close to 300,000 stars.</p>
 <p>The Wen Clan Old Ancestor wanted to kill Qing Shui so the old man could not help inwardly cursing Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui used his Descending Heavens Talisman, the Old Ancestor became a little dazed or rather stunned. Subsequently, Qing Shui started throwing all sorts of talisman, such as his Binding Talisman, at the old man. At the same time, he used all the talismans with buffs on himself.</p>
 <p>He was also Talisman Master…</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor felt like crying but he had no tears. He had just realized that Qing Shui was extremely cunning and could easily slip out of his hands like a loach.</p>
 <p>The old man waved his Black Onyx Trident.</p>
 <p>Nine Phantoms Soul Pursuit!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a faint black flow of qi rapidly appeared around Qing Shui’s body. Just like an intangible rope, it bounded Qing Shui tightly. At that very moment, the Old Ancestor rushed toward Qing Shui in a flash and launched his Black Onyx Trident in the direction of Qing Shui’s head.</p>
 <p>The large Black Onyx Trident was just like a Black Jiao and it let out a loud ghastly howl as it headed towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Ghostly Hypnosis Call!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as if he had been marked with a target. Furthermore, his opponent also possessed a terrifying speed. In the blink of an eye, the Black Onyx Trident was only three meters away from him!</p>
 <p>Xiu! Xiu!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui heard a series of piercing sounds that were so sharp, it was as though they could pierce through the starfield. This was a kind of sonar attack that was charged with spiritual energy. It was like Lion's Roar but weaker. The main purpose of that ghastly howl was to distract the opponent.</p>
 <p>The Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness started spinning rapidly. Qing Shui sealed his ears with his own spiritual energy and he defended himself against the Black Onyx Trident with his own Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Wave Essence!</p>
 <p>This time around, he used his brute strength and took the opportunity to step backwards. He was unable to activate the chance of the multiplying 20% of his offensive force. Qing Shui flew backwards when the weapons clashed, but he was unharmed.</p>
 <p>This all happened in a flash; about the time it took for three breaths. When the Wen Clan members had completed their formation, they were stunned to see the outcome of the few blows.</p>
 <p>“Old sir, I used those techniques because I wanted to thank you for answering my questions. I won’t hold back any longer. You better use your most powerful technique or join that formation. Otherwise, you will regret it.” Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword was now spewing a long Primordial Fire Snake.</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor was seething. He did not like being made fun of. His rather tranquil face was now extremely sinister. He drew a semicircle in front of him with his palm. Black flames of Qi appeared and engulfed his entire body. Such Dark Qi was like toxic dust; it not only blocked the view of the opponent, it was also poisonous.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the Old Ancestor did not know that Qing Shui was also well-versed in the use of poisons. If he had known that, he wouldn’t have used that technique!</p>
 <p>“DIE!”</p>
 <p>Soul Chasing Fatal Pursuit!</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor’s Black Onyx Trident headed for Qing Shui like a black venomous snake.</p>
 <p>Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword vibrated and a Primordial Fire Snake rushed forth from it, wrapping around the Black Onyx Trident. A series of clear crisp metallic sounds rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his left hand and threw multiple Coldsteel Needles at the old man.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed a shield-like item appearing in front of the old man; it also surrounded the Dark Qi within it. It was the same ‘shield’ that Wen Jing used, but he sensed that it was more powerful.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Dragon Drill!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui channeled his spiritual energy and targeted the old man’s protective shield.</p>
 <p>Such protective shields were powered by one’s spiritual energy. Even if it had been created by a treasure item, it was made of something very similar to spiritual energy. Hence, it would be easier to destroy them with spiritual energy as well. When the Primordial Flame Dragon Drill hit the protective shield, the protective shield vibrated violently for a moment. Based on the old man’s capabilities and given that his spiritual energy was at about 200,000 stars, the root source of the shield must be the old man’s strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spiritual energy was at 7000 stars, but his Arhat Rosary Beads boosted his spiritual energy to about 105,000 stars without any restraint from the laws of Heaven and Earth. Similarly, the Old Ancestor’s spiritual energy must also be free from these restraints.</p>
 <p>However, since Qing Shui’s flames were Primordial Flames, even when they were not at their maximum lethality, they were already extremely powerful. When used with a technique like Primordial Flame Dragon Drill, they could only become terrifyingly stronger.</p>
 <p>There was no way that the old man could compare to a Six-Headed Crystal Beast. Once that attack hit his protective shield, the protective shield shattered into smithereens.</p>
 <p>In that instant, the Old Ancestor was totally shocked. He was not only shocked, he was also scared. When he recalled how the young man maintained his composure, and how he carefully posed those three questions, the old man finally realized something.</p>
 <p>Pak!</p>
 <p>The old man was whipped once by Qing Shui’s Primordial Flames.</p>
 <p>“To your positions, Netherworld Formation!”</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor positioned himself in the center of the formation that his clan members had formed. As soon as he finished his sentence, a large illusion appeared and enveloped all of them.</p>
 <p>Python Tailed Lion!</p>
 <p>A large lion illusion appeared, but its tail was in the form of a large python and there was a malevolent-looking python head at the tip of the tail.</p>
 <p>The formation activated a Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Was that possible? Qing Shui could sense that this Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was much stronger than the one which belonged to the old man from Buddha Sect.</p>
 <p>The people in the formation channelled all their spiritual energy into the Python Tailed Lion illusion. As the illusion became clearer and clearer, it became obvious that the creature was pitch black and the python head appeared more and more vicious.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui targeted the python head with his nimble Primordial Flame Whip!</p>
 <p>Sssssss...</p>
 <p>The python head spat out a column of black qi, which corroded the Primordial Flame Whip, then it headed for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Ghostly Qi Devouring!</p>
 <p>The huge python head opened its wide mouth and spat out a ball of condensed grey cloud. It headed toward Qing Shui, travelling along the same trajectory as the Primordial Flame Whip, then the huge python head appeared directly in front of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection!</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not expected that he would have to use both Divinity Protection and Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
