 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, the Yin Clan had underestimated the Hong Clan. Qing Shui’s appearance was the biggest variable in the match. As for Hong Hong and Hong Gu, their strength had now surpassed the current Feng Xi and Old Man Wang. They were just almost as strong as Yin Tian when he was at his peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was just able to hold them back with his ability. This change in situation had caused both sides to be in severe shock. But deep down, other than just shock, Old Man Wang felt more grateful instead. The same went for Feng Xi and Yin Cha, but not as strongly as Old Man Wang. If it wasn’t for QIng Shui, he would still have died even after he raising the other’s strength to such a height.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike Old Man Wang and Feng Xi, the Hong Clan was upset and envious of the Yin Clan. This time, the Hong Clan was very confident that they could take down the Yin Clan no matter what sort of unexpected situation occurred. With that initial mindset which they had, they couldn’t feel more upset than anybody else with such an outcome. It made them feel like puking out blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t understand why their opponent would experience such a significant rise in their wounding ability, defensive prowess, as well as their speed. On the other hand, the people on their side were not only weakened, but also slowed dramatically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, they finally set their sight on the youngest man in the arena, Qing Shui!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brat had been behaving weirdly in the arena. Not only hds he not been making any move, he kept on shuttling back and forth around the arena. From time to time, all he did was swing his arms. Prior to this, it was because he moved past them that his and his brother’s strength dropped so significantly. Furthermore, the position which he stood at was also very unique. The young man was the only person who was shuttling back and forth across the arena, while the others didn’t bother to move even one step away from the spot right under their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, the experienced and knowledgeable Hong Brothers felt the need to eliminate the young man regardless of the cost. Not only would they destroy their formation, they might even be able to totally cripple their opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu-pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi and Yin Cha each killed an old man. Yin Cha had already managed to kill two of them. Since the opponents were able to realize Qing Shui’s importance, they should know even more clearly than anybody else. Hence, their main task would be to first eliminate those old men as quick as possible. Only by doing so would they be able to reach out to destroy their opponents’ strategies. Otherwise, if the opponents were to go on a team attack, especially when they set their target as Qing Shui, things would turn out to be very dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kong-kong…….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four Rain-Drizzling Birds appeared around Hong Hong and Hong Gu. These demonic beasts were a kind of Killing Beast. They were smaller than a hundred meters and had bodies long and thin like snakes. Their bodies were dyed in black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was by far the ugliest bird which Qing Shui had ever seen before. The two large wings they possessed were like two huge swords. They were thin like cicada’s wings and they were shining with dangerous, gloomy light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jie-jie…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sharp chirping noise was heard. The birds turned into four Divine Curved Blades as they charged towards Qing Shui. This caused both Old Man Wang and Feng Xi to feel uneasy. They knew just how fearsome the Rain-Drizzling Birds could be. In fact, all along, the appearance of the Rain-Drizzling Birds was one of the things which they feared the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, the reason why Feng Xi, Old Man Wang and Yin Cha proceeded to summon their demonic beasts was in order to take precautions for the Rain-Drizzling Birds’ sudden attack. Their demonic beasts were species similar to the Shield Beast. For a short period of time, they should be able to hinder the Rain Drizzling Birds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, they realized that the strength of the Rain-Drizzling Birds seemed to be even stronger than before. Though their strength hadn’t broken through to Divine Grade, they were still existences equivalent to peak False Gods. Among their species, they possessed top-notch speed. Their enormous wings could almost be described as being able to cut through anything. Despite all the descriptions about it, there were still many things they couldn’t cut through. Obviously, human bodies were an exception, with how easily they could be torn apart. Even for a Divine Grade Warrior at elementary level, the majority of their body was still made out of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others wanted to save him, but it was too late for them to do so. The Golden Staff in Qing Shui’s hand suddenly turned into a Soulshake Bell. He immediately swung it violently. A noise even sharper than the bird-chirping noise of the Rain-Drizzling Bird came through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t stop ringing the bell. The Dragon Slaying Beast took this moment to leap towards the bird at the front like a golden thunder. Like usual, the Dragon Slaying Beast possessed fearsome body strength. But now with Qing Shui further boosting it, its speed and strength were increased even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hell Nightmare Beast had been staying close to Qing Shui all along. If things really developed into a really bad situation, it would cover Qing Shui entirely with its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, Qing Shui still had a route to retreat. But now, Qing Shui hadn’t gotten to the extent where he needed to do that. He once again swung the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inescapable Net!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless vines appeared around Qing Shui. This was Qing Shui’s wood attribute ability from his Five Elements Divine Refining Technique. Though it might not be as fearsome as the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, it beat the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines in terms of the area it covered. Added on to Qing Shui’s current cultivation, the toughness of the vines cast from Inescapable Net was still something to be feared about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Inescapable Net was considered to be one of the most powerful wood-attribute killer techniques from the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique. The Inescapable Net mainly focused on its area. Though it was inferior to the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, the gap between them wasn’t that significant. It was only 20% less tough than the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. It was incapable of absorbing blood. The only function it had was to trap its target. The energy consumption was a few times more significant than the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vines that filled up the whole sky immediately separated Qing Shui from the Rain-Drizzling Birds. The Dragon Slaying Beast and the Rain Drizzling Bird at the most front, on the other hand, were trapped within the vines. Even the powerful Rain-Drizzling Birds found difficulty in opening up their wings within these vines. It’s like when a sharp kitchen knife got stuck in soft cotton wool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coincidentally, the Dragon Slaying Beast happened to have totally leaped onto the Rain Drizzling Bird. Because of the significant difference in size, the Dragon Slaying Beast totally had the upper-hand. Very quickly, a miserable bird-chirping noise was already heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another Rain-Drizzling Bird was irritated by Qing Shui’s Soulshake Bell to the point it started flying in circle from a distance. It was letting out a miserable bird-chirping noise and didn’t dare to make its way forward. The last two Rain-Drizzling Birds, on the other hand, were trapped within the countless vines. However, they flew high up the sky in an attempt to charge towards Qing Shui by bypassing the vines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui transmitted his voice to Feng Xi and Old Man Wang and instructed them to make their move. To be more precise, he told Yin Cha and Feng Xi to quickly kill their opponents. As for Old Man Wang, it would be fine as long as he could manage to hold off both of them. At this moment, Qing Shui summoned his Thunderous Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of situation might seem really dangerous, but Qing Shui still had a killer-move which he had yet to use. At the very least, he dared admit that these birds wouldn’t cause him any harm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rain-Drizzling Birds were just as strong as the Dragon Slaying Beast but it required them to cooperate with each other. Otherwise, their speed of their attack would slow down. Actually, Hong Hong and Hong Gu were precisely targeting Qing Shui for his speed. It’s just that if they had known about his actual speed, they would never have done something like that. Instead, they would have let the birds coordinate with them to kill Old Man Wang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they had killed Old Man Wang, they would have broken free from the situation they were currently in. But it seemed they let their guard down and thought that killing Qing Shui would make things a lot easier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main reason behind their action was because they didn’t want to see any more people from the Hong Clan sacrificing their lives. They felt that if the opponents were to go head-to-head against them, the risk of the battle would be greatly lowered. It would be a lot easier for them to kill their opponents and reduce the amount of casualties from their clan. This way, they could help save up some strength for their clan.</span></p>

A mistake in decision-making, even an insignificant one, might lead to a totally different outcome.</span></p>

Qing Shui, on the other hand, was already holding a Coldsteel Bead in his hand. At this moment, the Dragon Slaying Beast was already back by his side.</span></p>

The distant Rain-Drizzling Bird which was in shock still didn’t dare to approach Qing Shui. Qing Shui went to summon the Nine Continents Mountain.</span></p>

After all, the mountain itself still possessed formidable strength for the Shield Attack.</span></p>

At the same time, he also made the Dragon Slaying Beast charge into the direction in which the Rain-Drizzling Bird evaded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rain-Drizzling Bird was attacked from both sides. Furthermore, in the midst of the fight, a few changes occurred to the Dragon Slaying Beast and the Nine Continents Mountain. This further reduced the directions which the Rain-Drizzling Beast could evade into. At this moment, Qing Shui unleashed his Hidden Weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Hidden Weapon was invisible. It right away pierced into the left eye of the bird. The excruciating pain caused it to be greatly interrupted. With that happening, the Dragon Slaying Beast managed to leap towards it with ease.</span></p>

Right at this moment, Qing Shui swung his Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>

At the moment, Qing Shui’s Five Elemental Attacks were worth a hundred and sixty Dao Force. If the Rain-Drizzling Bird was hurt by it, the wound it suffered would be fatal.</span></p>

Even under this kind of situation, it still managed to evade Qing Shui’s Golden Sword. But right at this moment, the Thunderous Beast managed to land a Thunderbolt on the Rain-Drizzling Bird, causing it to stop momentarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Nine Continents Mountain was once again standing in between himself and the Rain-Drizzling Bird.</span></p>

The Green Dragon Position of the Four Symbols Formation helped significantly boost Qing Shui’s speed. He was already supposed to have incredible speed to begin with. Now, it was even more fearsome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Cha had finally killed off the last remaining old man. On Qing Shui’s side, not only were there two Rain-Drizzling Birds, the two old men from before were also besieging him. It’s only until now that the Hong Clan realized the truth, that the bewitching young man was extremely weird. If they really lost today, a huge part of the reason had to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inescapable Net, Art of Pursuing as well as Emperor’s Qi... with those in effect, the two old men were totally crippled. Even a mere Golden Sword could manage to cut an arm off one of the old men. Because of this occurrence, the two old men didn’t dare to charge forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two old men were the weakest ones among this group of people. They had recently just made it into Divine Grade. Hence, their strength weren’t much higher than Qing Shui. Though that might be the case, they were still a lot more powerful than Qing Shui because of their Divinity Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even with that, they were constantly dragged down to the edge of Divine Grade by Qing Shui’s Emperor’s Qi. With the state they were currently at, they didn’t know if they could still consider themselves Divine Warriors…...</span></p>

It was attacked from both side by Qing Shui and the Dragon Slaying Beast as well as the Nine Continents Mountain. The Thunderous Beast also supported them by continuously unleashing Thunderbolt. It took a very short while for it to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Cha was no longer occupied. Seeing that, Qing Shui told him to go and support Old Man Wang. Old Man Wang played a key role in this fight. If anything were to happen to him, the battle today would be hard-fought. The strengths of Hong Hong and Hong Gu were still very formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tide of the battle had already begun to turn. The Hong Clan was now like ants on a hot pot. Five of the old men had died, and one of them was also injured. They were all the Hong Clan’s main support. Losing one of them would mean a grave loss to the clan. It’s not easy for even the Divine Moon Immortal Sect to nurture a Divine Grade Warrior. After all, among the forest of immortal sects, their immortal sect was considered to be of a lower grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Prior to this, Qing Shui hadn’t made any move. Seeing as he was being chased after by the two old men, it even seemed like he was forced to be on the passive side. But now, they finally learnt that this young man who initially didn’t catch their eyes was capable of defeating two Divine Grade Warriors at the beginner grade with ease. If the opponents had charged their way towards him, they would definitely only put themselves in danger. At the moment, the two old men didn’t dare to make any careless moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just because they didn’t dare to charge forward didn’t mean that Qing Shui wouldn’t dare to do so. With his current defensive ability, he could straight up ignore the two old men’s attacks.</span></p>

This movement enabled him to immediately face himself against an armless Divine Warrior. Without much thought, he sliced him with the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand.</span></p>

While doing so, he shot the long sword in his arm towards Qing Shui’s chest.</span></p>
