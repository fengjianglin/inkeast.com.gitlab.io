 <p><strong>AST 1427 - Unpredictable, the powerful Heavenly Talisman </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a lot of flags. He waited for the right opportunity and began setting up formations. The speed at which he was currently setting up his formations was really fast. As a matter of fact, he managed to kill an Ancient Golden Flame Demonic Bear while he was halfway through setting up the Nine Palace Eight Trigram Formation.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, don’t move. If an Ancient Golden Flame Demonic Bear rushes in, kill it together right away.” Qing Shui said as he approached Zhan Yu.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui successfully managed to avoid a direct hit and only used the Taichi Golden Qi to push Zhan Yu, he was still severely injured. That was a Sure Kill Heavenly Technique. The bloody armor on his body might have been strong, but all of his organs were already injured badly, so much so that if he had used more force, they were bound to burst. By then, the only thing that awaited him was death. No matter how good Qing Shui’s medical expertise was, it would still be useless.</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Zhan, how are you feeling?” Qing Shui let out his hand to feel his pulse.</p>
 <p>Zhan Yu’s body was stained with fresh blood. Yet he revealed a smile on his face, “It seems elder brother owe you another debt this time. I owe you two lives.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so formal. Be careful, you may not be able to marry elder sister like this.” Qing Shui cracked a joke.</p>
 <p>At first, there were still tears on Hua Rumei’s face, but now her face revealed a bit of shyness as well. She said worriedly, “How is he? Is he in danger?”</p>
 <p>“As long as he is still breathing, I can assure you that I can save him. Elder Brother is good. He is in perfect shape.” While speaking, Qing Shui took out his Gold Needle and helped him performed acupunctures.</p>
 <p>With Force of Rebirth, Qing Shui’s formidable Acupuncture was slowly recovering the injuries across Zhan Yu’s body. The speed at which it healed was unbelievable. For a person’s medical expertise to achieve this kind of level, it was truly terrifying. If someone were to discover his medical expertise, they would definitely invite him over no matter the cost.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui kept his needles, Zhan Yu had more or less recovered by 50%. The only thing he needed to do to fully recover would be to have some good rest. If not for the Golden Fragrance Jade and Qing Shui’s treatment, he would have likely been down in the Netherworld reporting his attendance to Hades by now.</p>
 <p>Zhan Yu could now move as he pleased and was able to use his strength, which didn’t exceed that of Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>During this time, only one Ancient Golden Flame Demonic Bear intruded the area. It was killed by the group fairly easily.</p>
 <p>This was the Ancient Ruins. It had a lot of demonic beasts with ancient bloodlines. If one were to carelessly run into one, they would be in bad luck. The weak ones could only rely on their luck while they were here. If they had been careless for one second, they might end up totally erased.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui changed his formations, a lifegate was opened. It were as if he could hold back all of the enemies. As soon as an Ancient Golden Flame Demonic Bear appeared, The Dragon Slaying Beast, Dragon Turtle, Qing Shui, Demon Lord, Hua Rumei and the others would all rush forward to kill it instantly.</p>
 <p>After killing about twenty or more, the rest of them fled. Although demonic beasts at this level of strength weren’t as smart as humans, some of them still possessed intelligence up to a certain extent. They knew that they had run into formidable warriors today, hence they were left with no choice but to run. This was the basic instinct of demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Once again, Qing Shui managed to earn himself quite a few things. The skin of these Ancient Golden Flame Demonic Bear could be used to make heavy armors. Their bear galls as well as heart could be used to create medicines as well as make food taste more delicious. Qing Shui collected a lot of things from these monsters and put them into the realm. After that, he looked for a spot to set up his tent.</p>
 <p>They roasted bear meats together for their meal. Qing Shui gave the flavorings which he made to Jin Ci and the others.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei decided to stay with Zhan Yu. Zhan Yu was willing to throw away his own life for Hua Rumei. From here, it could be seen that this man truly loved her. It has always been said that the one who survived a disaster was destined to great fortune forever after. The both of them were considered to have experienced a calamity. Now, both of their hearts have gotten even closer to each other.</p>
 <p>With Hua Rumei gone, Qing Shui still chose to stay with the Demon Lord. He took out some wine while roasting some meat.</p>
 <p>“I wonder when Dragon Palace will show themselves. We are not far away from the Ancient Shrine.” Qing Shui said while roasting the meat.</p>
 <p>“It should be quite soon. They will definitely not make their move within the Ancient Divine Shrine.” The Demon Lord whispered.</p>
 <p>“Are the things within the Ancient Divine Shrine very important?”</p>
 <p>“It’s possible that Supreme Treasures will appear within the Ancient Divine Shrine. They are capable of overturning the fate of a particular sect. Of course, there is also the possibility that it may just be piles of rubbles.”</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Ruin is so big. If we don’t manage to encounter Dragon Palace, will the war still start?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“The probability of this happening is zero. This place is located not far away from Ancient Ruins. If I am right, we are already within the enemies’ sight by now. They are just waiting for an opportunity to make their move.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He smiled. No wonder Demon Lord would seclude herself with formations every time she arrived at a new place. It’s so that people from the outside wouldn’t be able to sense what she was doing from the inside.</p>
 <p>“Are you confident in beating Dragon Palace?” Qing Shui asked Demon Lord while passing her a piece of roasted meat.</p>
 <p>“There is nothing that’s absolute in this world. The only thing I fear is that there may be other people taking part in it alongside Dragon Palace. I only fear that someone will secretly lay their dirty hands on this.” Demon Lord seemed to be a bit displeased when she thought about this.</p>
 <p>“I have seen your footworks. Blend the Nine Palace Positionings into it.” Qing Shui was stating a fact when he had said this. This woman was able to cultivate the Nine Palace Steps to a point where she was not inferior compared to his own in the slightest. Furthermore, her weapons and killer techniques were too terrifying. If she was really able to perfect the Nine Palace Step, her foundation strength would definitely be redoubled.</p>
 <p>“I am already cultivating it. From the last time you gave it to me, I have already begun cultivating it. Now, I have cultivated up to the Eight Trigram Step. Ever since then, my progress came to a halt. I am unable to break through any further.” As the Demon Lord spoke, she sounded dull and cold like usual. Despite this, Qing Shui was still able to feel a slight fluctuation in her mind. She seemed to be feeling a bit unnatural, but that feeling was hard to describe in words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Such speed and talent…… Even though it had been a few years, it was still quite formidable for her to have cultivated up till the Eight Trigram Step. But why did she never use it? Qing Shui began to wonder if it had to do with him being here.</p>
 <p>But it seemed to not be thinking about these. Why wouldn’t she use it? The Eight Trigram Step was certainly even more powerful than her current footwork.</p>
 <p>“To break through Nine Palace Steps, it will require me to help access some of the acupoints across your legs and feet. And also, Body Constitution Nurturing. I will need to do that to help strengthen the restoration of some of the unmentionable diseases across your legs.” QIng Shui said gently. He said it very simply like he was talking without much thought.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui helped the Demon Lord fill up a bowl of soup. This was the first time the two of them had eaten alone. Qing Shui felt really weird. For unknown reasons, he was actually able to eat together with this woman. Despite how ice-cold this woman looked, she seemed to be someone who did not know how to reject others. If Qing Shui had not suddenly spurt out some stuff, it was very likely that he would not have been able to make it this far.</p>
 <p>Of course, if it had been some other guy, it was unlikely that they would be able to make it this far. Qing Shui had saved Hua Rumei and had also helped them a lot in medicinal pills, not to mention that he was a member of Demon Lord Palace. All of these reasons contributed to the situation today.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea what the Demon Lord was thinking. She was just sitting there ice-cold. She would not look at you, nor would she make you feel like she was neglecting you. At the same time, she also would not let you feel that you two were really close together. This made him felt a bit powerless.</p>
 <p>“If you feel like accessing it, you can come to me anytime you want. You don’t have to think that much.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Why do I have to think so much? We are not that close with each other.” Demon Lord looked at Qing Shui with cold eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui revealed an awkward smile, “Sorry, I was just trying to help you.”</p>
 <p>“We will talk about this next time. I feel like being alone for now. Thank you for today.” The woman gently give out the order to expel guests.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose. He stuck his own nose here today to be a person’s companion and chef, but in the end, he got kicked out by that very same person in a civilized manner. Despite this, he did not hold a grudge, nor did he hate the woman. This was how this woman was. As a matter of fact, it was also quite good that things were like these, at least a lot better than how Qing Shui used to think.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood up. He left Demon Lord’s tent and went back to his own tent.</p>
 <p>When time was about right, he entered the realm.</p>
 <p>Drawing!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again drew Demon Lord. He would draw one almost everyday. As of now, he was at Beginner level of drawing souls. At the time when he finished drawing, he remembered the Heavenly Talismans. It had been a long time since he last drew Heavenly Talismans.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui began drawing it, he felt that he was able to do it very naturally. In the past, even if he had been really skilled in drawing some of them, he would not feel natural like moving clouds and flowing water.</p>
 <p>That was a very strange feeling. Once someone reached this kind of state, they would find drawing talismans enjoyable. It would no longer be a job to them. They would not be forcing themselves to draw it. Now, it seemed to be a kind of pleasure similar to that of tasting good food.</p>
 <p>Divine Shield Talisman!</p>
 <p>Looking at the Heavenly Talismans that were a lot more powerful now than before, Qing Shui took it up and slapped it towards himself. Immediately, he was stunned.</p>
 <p>10%, it increased defense by 10%. Even for Qing Shui, who already had formidable defense, it would still be increased by 10%.</p>
 <p>As thought, a significant change took place. Qing Shui stopped suspecting it and quickly started to draw it; those that increased speed, strength, vitality, recovery ability, as well as also those that weakened opponents. While doing so, another half a day passed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui revealed a delighted smile. 10% worth of strength, it boosted his strength by 10% and also decreased the opponents’ by another 10%. It would be a change worth 20% in total, which was truly terrifying. Furthermore, they were tyrannical. Very few would actually manage to remove those negative effects. Even if there were some people who could manage to come in contact with it at first, they still would not be able to remove it immediately.</p>
 <p>When the Heavenly Talismans were cultivated up to this point, it was almost Emperor’s Qi equal. One worked the positive way, whereas the other one worked the negative way. His strength would be increased by 10% whereas the opponents’ would be decreased by 10%. If two people with equal strength were to battle, he would have been able to immediately cause his opponent’s strength to become 20% lower than his own. What kind of a concept was this?</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Talisman!</p>
 <p>Turning Wood Talisman!</p>
 <p>Earthflame Talisman!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Five Elements Talisman, also know as the Five Elements Counters. Qing Shui still likes the Heavenly Thunder Talisman the most. It could borrow heavenly thunder for attack if one’s level of drawing the talisman was high enough. It also a connection with one’s spiritual sense and once the talisman was successfully created, even ordinary cultivators could use it to great effect. If there’s over a hundred people using this talisman, even an incomparably powerful greater demonic beast would be blasted into bits.</p>
 <p>This kind of talismans consume Spirit Energy greatly when drawn. He felt that he could store this kind of talismans and also leave it for his family members in preparation for possible period of needs. It could help interrupt some people from using their powerful killer techniques.</p>
 <p>These Talismans could be used to attack, cure diseases, avoid water, and repel fire.</p>
 <p>But what Qing Shui was happiest about was the strength boost and the ability to weaken opponents strength. These two were simply too powerful.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the second day, when the group woke up, Qing Shui suddenly sensed something weird. There were mountains and forests in the surroundings, and as Qing Shui tried to sense deeper into it, his heart thumped.</p>
 <p>Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow Formation.</p>
 <p>Someone actually set up a powerful Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow Formation trap in the surroundings.</p>
 <p>“It seemed that for the time being, we won’t be able to escape. Someone actually set up a huge formation in the surroundings yesterday night. We are already at the centre of the formation.” The first person Qing Shui ran into was the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>“Formation? No wonder I have been feeling something different. It’s just that I was unable to tell what was different. It’s likely that the people from Dragon Palace has invited along powerful Formation Masters. Or else, they wouldn’t have dared to even go toe-to-toe with our Demon Lord Palace.” Demon Lord slightly knitted her brows.</p>
