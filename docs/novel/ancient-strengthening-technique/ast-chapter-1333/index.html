 <p><strong>AST 1333 - Yao Clan, Yao Qubing, a visit from the Yehuang clan</strong></p>
 <p>“His medical skills are very good. He’s much better than me,” Soulsearch laughed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui doubted Soulsearch slightly. Soulsearch could accurately diagnose a patient’s condition with his Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique, so it was much easier for him to diagnose and provide the correct treatment. Even if his medical skills might not be the best, he was definitely one of the top-notch physicians as he would not give a wrong diagnosis.</p>
 <p>“Brother, you are too humble. With your Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique, you just have to practice the few acupuncture techniques I taught you. I don’t dare to guarantee anything else but you will surely be much better than before.” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
 <p>“Yes. I can already tell. I have used some of the techniques in the past two days.” Soulsearch agreed joyfully.</p>
 <p>Li Ji watched Soulsearch and Qing Shui, a blissful smile appeared on her face. Her wish came true because of that young man and if she could have a child with Soulsearch, she would have no regrets.</p>
 <p>“By the way, is that person a local?” Qing Shui wondered if that person was from Yehuang City.</p>
 <p>“He is a member of the clan of divine physicians, the Yao Clan. The Yao Clan is a famous medical aristocrat clan and there are many physicians and alchemists in their clan. They are definitely the best medical clan in Yehuang City,” Soulsearch said with a serious tone.</p>
 <p>“Oh, he’s that good? Why does he want to join our Imperial Cuisine Hall?” Qing Shui couldn’t understand. If that person was from such a good medical aristocrat clan, wouldn’t it be better for that person to advance within his clan? Furthermore, it was rated as the best medical clan in the region. Logically speaking, he should stay in his own clan unless there were some other reasons.</p>
 <p>“He doesn’t have the proper birth rights. Though his medical skills are good, he has few opportunities in his own clan. He wanted to venture out, just to see if there might be another path for him.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, so he wants to see if we can take him in. How old is he?” Qing Shui felt that this was important.</p>
 <p>“He is slightly older than you, he looks quite young,” Soulsearch replied after giving it some thought.</p>
 <p>“Send someone to inform him to come here tomorrow. I want to see if he is qualified to join our Imperial Cuisine Hall.”</p>
 <p>“I have already done that.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was free at night, so he went into his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to train. He started refining his magic treasures. For now, there were no signs that his Coiled Dragon Statue, Heaven Shaking Drum, Spirit Gathering Lamp or Formation Eye Stone could be upgraded soon. Spirit Channeling Jade rose by one level, allowing Qing Shui to refine his items at a faster speed. He also faced a bottleneck with his Demon Binding Ropes and Soulshake bell. Since Soulshake bell had already reached the Ninth level, he did not know if there was even a tenth level but he could still refine it.</p>
 <p>Be it carving Seal formations or practicing his Nine Palace Laws, his training involved so many activities that he was extremely busy, even though he had time. Amidst all that, he still had to concoct pellets he used frequently, brew wine and even create more culinary dishes.</p>
 <p>As for the Roc form in his Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, he did not know if it could advance further after mastering his Seal of Roc. Heart of Roc was already at Great Perfection State, so there was barely any progression. It was down to luck if he wanted to reach another breakthrough for it. The same could be said for Roc Spreading Wings. It would be difficult to break through the current constraints of the skill.</p>
 <p>Like always, he continued practicing his Thousand Hammer Technique because he planned to create even god-level items. Besides, the technique was useful in battle, ever since its attack became incredibly powerful. He worked on his Violet Star Thunder God. As he had his Big Dipper Sword, he used his Violet Star Thunder God only as a practicing tool for his hammering techniques since he could not improve its attack capabilities. Furthermore, he hoped that doing that would help unleash Violet Star Thunder God’s potential power. If he was successful, he would have two powerful weapons, though he couldn’t be sure if that would actually happen.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the second day after breakfast, he received good news. Li Ji was pregnant. Qing Shui counted the number of days since he had helped Soulsearch recover. It was less than a month and Qing Shui didn’t expect this would happen so quickly. Qing Shui used his spiritual sense on Li Ji and sensed the vital signs of two peolpe. One was stronger and the weaker one was naturally the fetus in Li Ji’s womb.</p>
 <p>“Brother, Congratulations!”</p>
 <p>Things were already set since Qing Shui left the previous celebration. Soulsearch had decided to marry Li Ji even if she didn’t have his child.</p>
 <p>Once it was afternoon, the physician from Yao Clan arrived. Qing Shui spotted him from the fifth floor. That man was near middle-age. He was handsome and very reserved. While he walked with a straight posture, he exuded an air of cultured elegance. “Brother Soulsearch, this must be divine physician Qing. Let me introduce myself. I am Yao Qubing.” The man smiled faintly, in a neither servile nor overbearing manner. He seemed easy to get along with but he seemed a little skeptical when he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“You can call me Qing Shui, Brother Yao,” Qing Shui greeted the man.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch gestured for them to sit.</p>
 <p>“I’ll just be direct. Brother Qing Shui, please don’t blame me for being straightforward here. I want to watch you display your medical skills. If I am satisfied, I will join Imperial Cuisine Hall.” Yao Qubing went straight to the point.</p>
 <p>“This is not a business. I’ll put it this way. You need to consider if I am worthy and I also have to test if you are worthy. Let’s see if we are both satisfied!” Qing Shui could tell that Yao Qubing was a little brash but he wasn’t unbearable.</p>
 <p>“Okay. I am sorry if I sounded offensive. Please pardon me.”</p>
 <p>“It’s alright. I understand. As long as you have the skills, it doesn’t matter even if you are ten times more straightforward,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Yao Qubing nodded, “Mr Qing, how should we test each other?”</p>
 <p>“Since you are my guest here today, you can start first.” Qing Shui gestured for Yao Qubing to test him first.</p>
 <p>Yao Qubing thought for awhile before he spoke, “Okay. I have been suffering from a long-term condition. I wonder if you could diagnose my condition and let me know if it is curable.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed, “Mr. Yao, you can’t you cure yourself?”</p>
 <p>“No,” Yao Qubing replied sheepishly.</p>
 <p>Many physicians face the common problem— they couldn’t treat themselves. No matter what sort of divine medical skills one had, one could not avoid death.</p>
 <p>“You have a genetic heart deformity. Your heart functions poorly as it is only ⅘ the size of a normal person’s heart. You have to eat Saint’s Heart Fruit monthly to survive,” Qing Shui replied simply.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch could also easily diagnose Yao Qubing’s condition but had no way of treating him. He might have learned the acupuncture techniques from Qing Shui but he did not have Nine Yang Force, Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and Life and Death Needles. Along with other circumstance, he could only improve that man’s condition by 1% to 2%. Even so, that was already considered a great talent.</p>
 <p>“Can you treat my condition, Mr Qing?” Yao Qubing wasn’t surprised. Since Qing Shui knew Soulsearch, it wasn’t weird for him to know about his condition. He was more concern about whether it was curable.</p>
 <p>“If I told you I could treat your condition, what do you expect?” Qing Shui asked smiling.</p>
 <p>“I hope that you would treat me.”</p>
 <p>“Why should I do that?”</p>
 <p>“If you do it, I will know how skillful you are. I would also be cured and I would promise to join Imperial Cuisine Hall,” Yao Qubing said a little eagerly. The condition must cause him quite a bit of suffering.</p>
 <p>“Your abilities are not good enough to be a physician here in Imperial Cuisine Hall,” Qing Shui concluded shaking his head.</p>
 <p>“But you haven’t tested me, why would you say that?” Yao Qubing asked in a daze with a changed expression.</p>
 <p>“I already tested you but sadly you failed.” Qing Shui stood up and left after he said those words.</p>
 <p>“Divine Physician Qing, list your conditions. What do i have to do before you would treat me?” Yao Qubing changed the way he called Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I want half a Medical clan. Would you be able to give me that?” Qing Shui turned to look at Yao Qubing.</p>
 <p>“I can’t give you that. I am nothing in my clan,” Yao Qubing answered dejected.</p>
 <p>“Since you are nothing there, why do you aim to come to Imperial Cuisine Hall? Do you think that by you coming here, you are gracing our Imperial Cuisine Hall with your presence?” Qing Shui said slowly. He didn’t like that man from the start. That man was someone who didn’t know his place. He could tell that Yao Qubing’s main aim was to receive treatment. Perhaps he might stay after that but his heart was with his clan.</p>
 <p>“Sir, please save me. I will work here for the rest of my life.” Yao Qubing kneeled down and begged. He knew that without treatment, Saint’s Heart Fruit could only sustain his life for less than ten years. If he died, it would all be over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not used to people kneeling before him. He shifted away and looked at Yao Qubing, “You still have about ten years to live. If I treat your condition, you have to work here for ten years first.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui won’t treat this man now, he would only do it in ten years. It was up to Yao Qubing to stay and believe Qing Shui’s capabilities. Yao Qubing changed his clothes into an Imperial Cuisine Hall attendance uniform. But he was basically a worker who could also act as a physician.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t have other hidden agendas. Ten years was certainly enough to mend a person’s attitude. This was the man’s life. Originally, he could be a normal physician and receive a salary. Now, he was just an attendant but he probably didn’t know how the next ten years would change his life.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch did not have any comments on Qing Shui’s decision.</p>
 <p>“Brother, do you believe that in ten years, that Medical Clan will belong to him?” Qing Shui asked cheerily.</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Soulsearch said with certainty.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched the busy, prosperous street from the fifth floor window. He didn’t know when he would be able to act as he pleased. He never let his guard down. Even if he wanted to help Demon Lord and her Demon Lord Palace, he would need to reach the level of False God. Where was the palace that Yiye Jiange went to? Was it in the Five continents, Western Oxhe Continent or the Three Continents?</p>
 <p>How powerful could Seven-headed Crystal Beast get and how powerful could Yiye Jiange become? He suddenly realized that it would be very difficult to meet her. As the potential in each of his women unfolded, he did not know how much time it would take for him to gather all of them again.</p>
 <p>This was a crucial ten years for him. It was also a crucial decade for his children. It was also critical for all the members of his Qing Clan. Would he be able to achieve everything he wanted in the next ten years?</p>
 <p>Knock Knock!</p>
 <p>Soulsearch walked in and looked at Qing Shui, “Someone is looking for you. A person from Yehuang clan.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised to hear the words “Yehuang Clan”. It seemed like whatever he was trying to avoid would purposely present itself. This was faster than he expected. He nodded his head and walked out. He wanted to know why they had come and hopefully, they were not trying to cause any trouble for him.</p>
