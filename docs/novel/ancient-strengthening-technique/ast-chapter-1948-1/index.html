 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's hand clenched tightly. Yiye Jiange sensed Qing Shui's loving emotion toward her and turned to look at this man whom she loved the most. When she saw his satisfied and loving gaze, she felt very warm inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Jiange, I love you!" Qing Shui showed his affections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't know why he said this out. It just felt very natural and normal to him but at the same time, it was very loving. It wasn't a performance but a reveal of his inner feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange was taken breathless. After having been with Qing Shui for so many years, she knew his character well. He had said this in the past as well and it was undoubtedly his true feelings. However, today, she felt that this was a maturity. After becoming mature, this was his revelation toward her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, I love you too!"</span></p>

Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're courting death!" Yiye Jiange couldn't help but chided him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This guy was not as old as her but enjoy teasing her like this whenever he could. And on many occasions, she did what he had asked of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and put her in a princess carry. Yiye Jiange wasn't shocked and just quietly rested in his embrace. Qing Shui slowly treaded on the green grass and walked toward the setting sun. The glow from the sunset lasted seemingly eternally and their shadows were drawn out to be endless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you going to leave?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Yiye Jiange’s mind wasn't in mutual harmony with Qing Shui, Qing Shui still couldn't hide what he was thinking from this intelligent lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I do plan on doing so, but I can't bear to part with you." Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You've already been here for long enough. It's also about time for you to head back home to take a look. The things here are already settled. There's no need to worry about us. There's nothing much here that could pose a threat to us anymore. Moreover, with your bad reputation out there, who would dare to offend you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The feud with the Starry Immortal Palace is a done deal. Things shouldn't be over yet. Therefore, even if I were to leave, I'll make sure to deal with the things here properly. You've also reached a small success stage in the formation. It shouldn't be a problem for you to defend a place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the past few years, Qing Shui had been teaching them formations. However, only Yiye Jiange and Tantai Lingyan were able to reach the small success stage. Another person was Yu Niang. What had surprised Qing Shui was that Yu Niang didn't have much talent in martial arts. That had made Qing Shui use the Xiantian Golden Pellet to help her raise her cultivation to the Xiantian level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he hadn't expected for it to be so smooth-sailing for her when she was learning formations. She didn't lose to Yiye Jiange and the others, causing a huge surprise to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Qing Shui a lot more assured over the Imperial Cuisine Hall's safety. Another thing was that they don't really say much between her and Tianyi. Tianyi had treated Yu Niang very well but if it wasn't for Yu Niang's unique ability, their lives would have become even blissful and harmonious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emotions weren't that simple. For example, a person could like beauties and not ugly ladies. Saying that a person was only superficial and only like beauties was just crap. A person's beauty was an ability, an asset. In his previous life, there were people who only liked rich men. Regardless if one wanted to call such ladies moronic or snobbish, having money was also an ability in itself. Being able to satisfy their vanities was also a kind of happiness. People tended to pursue happiness. Possessing beauties is a happy thing and when women were with rich men, they would also obtain happiness. There was no right or wrong and there was no infringement on morality. It was just that people pursued different things. Humans were the most complicated animals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Niang was a beauty with a graceful and restrained disposition that could make one quiet down easily. Next to her, people would tend to let go of a lot of burdens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hey, why are you thinking about other women when you're carrying me?" Yiye Jiange pouted and called out at Qing Shui, who had gone into a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're my goddess. You must have the confidence of one." Qing Shui slapped her round butt as he replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That crisp sound rang out clearly in the quiet valley, making Yiye Jiange’s face turn fully red. However, she felt very happy, knowing that she was still very important in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at this shy lady, this transcendent woman, flames lit up in Qing Shui's eyes. Just as he was about to have his way with her here, Yiye Jiange held down his mischievous hands, "You aren't allowed to do it here. At least wait until we go home tonight..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui heard the sacred voice saying such seducing words, it was as if he had eaten ice cream on a hot day and felt very comfortable all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui set up a formation immediately. Although this place was safe, it was still better to put up a defense. He put up a defensive formation and two Hypnotizing Formations. From the outside, no one would be able to see anything inside. It would be as if there was nothing at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the bed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is there a need for me to strip?" Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and asked, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's the same as in the past. We've been through this a number of times before. Why are you still doubting me? I shan't stand on ceremony then." Qing Shui rubbed his forehead and then pounced on her, kissing her while his hands masterfully removed her clothes. Qing Shui's hands moved about dexterously on her body and it wasn't long before Yiye Jiange wrapped her hands around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was aroused!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing that the body under him was heating up, Qing Shui's body entered a warm, wet, and narrow path. Not long later, melodious sounds rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui speechlessly while Qing Shui brought out the gold needles, smiling as he did so. However, his gaze continued to linger on Yiye Jiange's beautiful body, especially on the twin peaks on her chest. They were snow white and tender, like the most precious white jade porcelain. Under the complement of what that was similar to the snow in the spring's sun, the pink tips at the very top gave off a strong attraction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What are you looking at? Haven't you seen enough?" Yiye Jiange didn't know what to say. This man was like a robot that didn't know what fatigue was. It was as if he would never be satisfied in this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui grinned and said, "It will never be enough!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was getting late. It was already quite late when they had arrived and now, the sky was about to turn dark soon. Even the light stones in the area had lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's gold needles began piercing onto Yiye Jiange's body one by one.</span></p>

The power of the Shield attack had integrated into the paragon vessel. The power from before didn't disappear but merely integrated together.</span></p>

Before the acupuncture, Yiye Jiange had already taken the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and the intensified Fate Pill.</span></p>

It had a miraculous effect on breaking barriers and revival. Although its effect wasn’t powerful enough to bring one back to life, it was capable of keeping one alive. It was like the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling, but was stronger than it.</span></p>

The power in her body continued to increase. At the same time, there was also a mysterious and unique power. Qing Shui now knew that it was the power of a unique physique. As long as one could absorb that power, it would be just like a person having gone through Blood Awakening. To be honest, regardless if it was Blood Awakening or the power of special physical, either of them would make one stronger.</span></p>

Everyone's blood lineage was different and this was also why there were differences between the strong and the weak. There were varieties of demonic beasts, just like how dragons and pigs were different. However, humans were only differentiated by men and women. Therefore, the differences only laid inside their bodies. This was also why people could achieve different levels of cultivation even if they were all to cultivate for the same amount of time.</span></p>

In addition to some other reasons thereafter, he now had the Nine Yang Physique. Both his blood lineage and the Nine Yang Physique sounded very mysterious but they were just names that were given based on their strength and their special traits.</span></p>

She now had a strength of 50 million Dao force. Putting on her clothes, she felt very happy. However, at that moment, thunderbolts started to gather in the sky.</span></p>
