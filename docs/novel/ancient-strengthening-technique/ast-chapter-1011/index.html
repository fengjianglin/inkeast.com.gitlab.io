 <p><strong>AST 1011 - Evolution, The Formidable Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant</strong></p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The blood colored mist on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s body dispersed. The scale armor covering its body had fully formed. It was different than the violet scale armor on the Berserk Dragon. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s was golden in color and looked a little similar to the Berserk Dragon, only its body was a lot smaller in size.</p>
 <p>It also looked very different now compared to before. It looked more bold and powerful, fully covered in shiny golden armor scales. The dragon head on it looked slightly ferocious, its four limbs and tail were thick and powerful.</p>
 <p>If he hadn’t seen all this with his own eyes, it would be very difficult for him to believe that this was the same Diamond Gigantic Elephant from earlier. Qing Shui was extremely happy right now. He was sensing the current strength of the ‘Diamond Gigantic Elephant’ as he looked at it with his Heavenly Vision Technique activated.</p>
 <p>Its physical strength had reached to 800 stars. The gain of 500 stars in physical strength had rendered Qing Shui speechless. When he thought about how the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could be considered to have undergone a complete transformation this time, he no longer found it strange. He was clueless on what he should call it now. He didn’t know if it could be considered a Dragon Elephant, so he decided to still call it the Diamond Gigantic Elephant for now since he was already used to it.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant’s Might, a passive battle technique. Permanent increase in physical strength by 70%.</p>
 <p>Formidable was all Qing Shui could feel right now but it was still within his expectations. After all, the dragon’s bloodline within its body was being thoroughly stimulated right now and the Origin Essence Soul Pearl’s energy was also great enough.</p>
 <p>This had immediately allowed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s strength to reach to 6,400 stars. However, under the rules of Heaven and Earth, only the strength of 5,000 stars could be exhibited. Even so, it still had battle techniques that doubled its offensive power again. With these, it could exhibit about 5,800 stars.</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant’s Recklessness, threefold attack. Ten targets at most.</p>
 <p>It had doubled compared to before and the name had changed. This could allow the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s attacks to reach more than 19,000 stars. But due to the rules of Heaven and Earth, only a strength of 6,500 stars could be exhibited.</p>
 <p>That was good enough. Qing Shui felt very content. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant could become his capable assistant once again and participate in battles. This had raised Qing Shui’s confidence by quite a lot again.</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp, Grand Perfection Stage. Tenfold physical offensive power. A certain chance of paralyzing opponent’s limbs, immobilizing them.</p>
 <p>800 stars of physical strength, the name had also changed to Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp. This meant that the Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp was 8,000 stars of strength but what made him happy was the certain chance in paralyzing opponents at the end of the description. This had once again made the Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp into a formidable technique.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Dragon Elephant Evasion: An instantaneous leap within a distance of 1,000 metres!</p>
 <p>The powerful battle techniques were upgraded once again, by increasing their range.</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi: Spits out a wave of Core Qi to attack the opponent. Possesses great killing power. Able to reduce target’s speed by 20%, effect lasts for one hour.</p>
 <p>There was no change in this!</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons: Lowers the strength of multiple targets by 10% within a radius of 1,000 metres after casting. Number of targets cannot exceed ten. Effect lasts for two hours!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. This time, he had a feeling that the Vajra Subdues Demons technique was usable again. On top of that, it was even more useful than before. Although the distance seemed long enough, it wasn’t really that long. Including the tail, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was almost 100 metres long.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack: Launches an attack at one target in an instant. Can raise offensive power threefold!</p>
 <p>The Ferocious Diamond Attack had also changed into the Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack. The previous few battle techniques were also changed into Dragon Elephant battle techniques. Only some Diamond Gigantic Elephant battle techniques were kept. It seemed like it had really changed into a Dragon Elephant. Qing Shui looked at these battle techniques in surprise. With this, the Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack seemed to have become the mightiest attack of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant now. It could reach to 25,600 stars of offensive power. Even under the rules of Heaven and Earth’s effects, it could still exhibit 7,000 stars of offensive power.</p>
 <p>Dark Infernal Flames: Dark Infernal Flames under the feet allows the Dragon Elephant’s attack to possess a 20% armor breaking offensive power. At the same time, it doubles the Dragon Elephant’s speed in the skies.</p>
 <p>This had changed too. At least it was useful and was quite decent or maybe he could even say that it was extremely decent. It could increase speed and also had the ability to break through armor. All this time, Qing Shui had thought that this Dark Infernal Flames wasn’t really useful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was staring at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant that was standing in the skies, especially at the Dark Infernal Flames at the bottom of its feet. It looked just like a lotus flower.</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant Armor: Allows Dragon Elephant’s defense to increase tremendously. A powerful physical body is the best ability of the Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to let out a few loud roars very badly right now. The kind of happiness he felt could be described as a rapture. Qing Shui still felt extremely excited even though he had experienced countless surprises before.</p>
 <p>He still had an Origin Essence Soul Pearl but Qing Shui knew that it couldn’t be used within this short period of time. Even if he waited until it could be used again, it would increase strength very little. The tremendous increase in physical strength this time was mainly due to the transformation.</p>
 <p>Looking at the shiny golden Dragon Elephant, Qing Shui decided that it was better for him to change its name. Since he was fully covered in golden scales, he might as well name it as the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>The strength of Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had increased by 500 stars. In addition to those from earlier, this could allow Qing Shui’s physical strength to increase by more than 110 stars.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s purpose in coming to the Giant Beasts Mountains was to raise the strength of him and his demonic beasts. So right now, he was refining the energy that had been bestowed upon him by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Compared to using the Hallow Pill, he had taken a lot of time this time. It took him more than half a month to complete refining the energy. Over this period of time, Qing Shui’s strength had also increased very rapidly, reaching 570 stars.</p>
 <p>After holding the Big Dipper Sword in his hands, his strength immediately soared to 15,000 stars. This meant that he could unleash the strength of 6,000 stars. With Area Dominance, he could unleash a strength of 7,000 stars.</p>
 <p>If he was met with a 20% chance of doubling damage, then he would be able to unleash a strength of 8,500 stars. He still had Descending Heavens Talisman and Emperor’s Qi, as well as the current Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s Vajra Subdues Demons. He had a feeling that he had the capability to deal with some issues now. Still, he was cautious as he was afraid that powerful people might appear from outside.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Qing Shui’s strength had risen. His spirit energy had increased along with it too. The might of Primordial Flame Whip had also slightly increased. Even though it wasn’t enough to deal with the Berserk Dragon, Qing Shui was confident that he could smash the head of cultivators that had strength of slightly more than 10,000 stars like the Berserk Dragon with it. After all, the defense and body size of a human cultivator couldn’t be compared with demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>If he was using the Violet Star Thunder God, Qing Shui’s strength could reach to almost 23,000 stars when he unleashed the Raging Blow. Under the rules of Heaven and Earth and Area Dominance, it would be 7,800 stars.</p>
 <p>With Qing Shui’s strength and weakening techniques like the Emperor's Qi, if he were to face the Berserk Dragon again now with this kind of strength, things should be different. At least he would be equally matched with his opponent in terms of power. But if he had to kill his opponent, a trump card was still needed.</p>
 <p>Since the Gigantic Diamond Elephant had consumed the Origin Essence Soul Pearl from the Berserk Dragon, it wouldn’t be able to consume another Origin Essence Soul Pearl again for a short period of time. If it consumed another Origin Essence Soul Pearl of lower grade again in the future, the effects would be lowered or it could even be ineffective.</p>
 <p>There was a certain amount of time required between consuming the Origin Essence Soul Pearls. There was no way that things like medicinal pills origin Essence Soul Pearls and cores could keep raising demonic beasts by their full amounts.</p>
 <p>Decompose!</p>
 <p>In any case, the Origin Essence Soul Pearl that was most suitable to be consumed by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant couldn’t be consumed again for a period of time. High leveled Demonic Beast’s Origin Essence Soul Pearls were usually only effective on their first consumption. Qing Shui was looking to see if there were any demonic beasts in his possession that could consume the Berserk Dragon’s Origin Essence Soul Pearl.</p>
 <p>He decided to decompose it even though it was somewhat of a pity. During the decomposing process, half of the energy would be lost. Not only that, there was no fixed amount of Origin Essence Soul Pearls that could be broken down either.</p>
 <p>If only one pearl was decomposed, even when half of the energy was lost, it would still not be suitable for any of his demonic beasts. It wasn’t right for Luan Luan’s Golden Jiao King either. Although it was jiao, there was no dragon’s bloodline within its body so it could only stop at being a Golden Jiao King.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to gamble on this. It would only be a waste to save something this good right now. At such a crucial time, I should use all possible methods to increase my strength since I’m going to face the Buddha Sect and Demon Gate of the Central Continent very soon.” Qing Shui was firm about his opinions when he thought up to this point.</p>
 <p>Looking at the time, he decided that it was better for him to enter the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal tomorrow to perform the decomposition. He still had to ensure that there was enough time to perform it. So he continued cultivating within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, trying to adapt his body to his current energy.</p>
 <p>The next day, they continued their search. Although there was quite a number of formidable demonic beasts, their instincts were very accurate. The Berserk Dragon had died at Qing Shui’s hands because it was stronger than Qing Shui and didn’t treat Qing Shui as an opponent. It had never even thought of escaping even when death was in its face.</p>
 <p>Demonic beasts would usually escape, as was their instinct. When Luan Luan fought, if she didn’t need anything on the demonic beast, then she would let it escape. She fought for the sake of increasing her experience in battles and also to solidify her current strength.</p>
 <p>The strength of Luan Luan’s ten Earth Devouring Mice had also increased tremendously, especially the one that led the pack. Although there was still quite a distance before it could break through to Early Martial Emperor, there was still a good chance of it happening. This thing’s ability to devour was very powerful. It could devour Origin Essence Soul Pearls that were much stronger than it.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, what is that?”</p>
 <p>Luan Luan suddenly pointed at something up ahead.</p>
 <p>There was cave. A hidden cave situated halfway up a mountain.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. We’re going to take a look in there!” Qing Shui smiled at Luan Luan. He couldn’t sense anything since it was too far so he could only go up there and have a look! There might be some treasures that were left behind in caves like these sometimes but the chances were very slim. Over these few days they had searched no less than ten caves but came up empty handed. Sometimes, they might even encounter demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>As they were approaching the cave entrance, Qing Shui suddenly felt a wave of powerful pressure but then again it didn’t really feel like it. They were at the Giant Beasts Mountains. He wouldn’t be surprised if there was a formidable demonic beast in this cave and he didn’t dare to be reckless right now.</p>
 <p>However, this aura didn’t feel like it belonged to a demonic beast. Yet it was intensely repelling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan cried out in alarm when the gigantic Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant appeared. The sudden appearance of such powerful and huge demonic beast had frightened her.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be scared. This is that Gigantic Diamond Elephant from before. It has evolved into a Dragon Elephant,” Qing Shui hurriedly explained.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan was surprised because this Dragon Elephant was too similar to the Berserk Dragon. The only difference between them was their colors. “This Dragon Elephant seems powerful.” She exclaimed happily after hearing Qing Shui’s explanation.</p>
 <p>“Lass, you stay here. I’m going in to take a look.”</p>
 <p>“Be careful, Daddy!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded as he expanded his spiritual sense and went inside the cave. The pressure here was different than the shrines. It wasn’t as intense either. The moment he entered, he realized that there was a faint sacred and dignified aura here, causing one to feel deep veneration.</p>
 <p>This appeared to be the hall of a temple. It wasn’t huge and there wasn’t any trace of wild or demonic beasts here. The dust on the floor was about half a foot thick. There were 16 small stone pillars that were scattered in groups of four.</p>
