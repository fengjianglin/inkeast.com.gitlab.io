 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Azuregold Snake had no wings and yet, it was able to fly. Whether it was in the ocean, on the land, or in the sky, its movement would not be hindered. Because it had recognized its owner, the Azuregold Snake was quite fond of Tantai Lingyan. For the time being, it seemed that the current Azuregold Snake would still bind itself around its owner’s arm during battles. Nevertheless, it wouldn’t affect its owner’s movements as it mainly followed along their movements. In fact, with the Azuregold Snake’s ability to resist attacks, it could work as armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan really liked her Azuregold Snake. The moment she extended her arm, the Azuregold Snake would cling onto her arm. However, there were still three meters of its body which were coiled up so that it could still initiate its attacks anytime it wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui remembered that he still had one more Azuregold Snake. Qing Hanye no longer needed it since she had the Poison Dragon King. The Poison Dragon King would turn out to be a powerful existence. Other than that, though back then, the Poison Dragon King had said that there was a time limit to their deal. However, Qing Shui knew that even if he were to kick it away, it would refuse to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Qingcheng also didn’t need it. Her Sun Golden Crow had already grown up. It could be used for both offense and as a mount. It had a great potential. Luo Qingcheng had spent these past few years taking thorough care of Sun Golden Crow. Demonic beasts were the closest partner a human could ever find. Qing Shui took the strength of the demonic beasts around him very seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge also didn’t need it. Her White Jade Dragon was a pure dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Qin Qing, she didn’t even cross Qing Shui’s mind. Not only did she have the enormous Green Dragon but she also had the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda. In the morning, Qing Shui had helped her raise her strength. She was also at the middle stage of her seventh level of divinity. All of them just made it into the middle-stage. She should no longer have any problems dealing with the people around her area. There should only be very few who could actually injure her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, Qing Shui made up his mind to give the other Azuregold Snake to Yin Tong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fox Battle God and the Azuregold Snake could be considered a perfect match for each other. This way, Yin Tong’s strength would be boosted significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, half a month had passed. Qing Shui had already finished the things which he needed to do. The Imperial Cuisine Hall had people looking after it. As for the Sunset Seaking and Dragon Wolf Palace, it was not easy for even the Great Confucian Empire to look after them. However, the Great Confucian Empire would still be quite influential around the area given that the Sunset Sea King Palace and Dragon Wolf Palace stopped progressing any deeper into the territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, the current Sunset Seaking and Dragon Wolf Palace no longer needed to be taken care of. After all, with the girls’ own strength along with their formidable demonic beasts, if there were no major accidents, they should be able to stand firmly on their own ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to leave this place. The girls, on the other hand, went back to Sunset Seaking Palace and Dragon Wolf Palace respectively. However, Qing Shui left Yiye Jiange and Qing Hanye together. This way, they would have each other to look after. Considering that Qing Hanye was pregnant, he must be all the more cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong, Lan Lingfeng, Ziche Cha, and Ling Fei all remained in Imperial Cuisine Hall. Currently, there was one more person keeping eyes on them. The Main Emperor of Great Confucian Empire, also known as the Thirteenth Prince. Though he was Qing Shui’s disciple, he still called Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong as his own siblings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Qing Shui left this place, he felt that he must also return home once. After all, it had been so long since he last went back. Once he departed this time, even he wasn’t sure how long it would be until the next time he came back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five Elements Divine Flag!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Husband and Wife Teleportation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately appeared next to Yehuang Guwu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yehuang Guwu felt a fluctuation in the aura around her surrounding, she revealed a surprised look on her face. As she found Qing Shui who appeared out of nowhere, she happily leaped into Qing Shui’s arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were in Yehuang Guwu’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu could use the Husband and Wife Teleportation to look for Qing Shui. By then, she could also return back to where she came from. It was not true to say that she didn’t miss Qing Shui. In fact, she missed him more than anyone did. However, she didn’t want to break the rules because she knew that once she did it, she would want to do it twice. The Qing Clan needed her. If she left this place and anything were to go wrong, even if she died, she would find it hard to forgive herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hugged the attractive and mature woman tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve missed you!” Yehuang Guwu said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those three words made Qing Shui felt a bit guilty. He immediately kissed her, “I miss you too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a few years since he returned. Yehuang Guwu was still the same. The only thing different about her was her strength. She now possessed fearsome strength. Without Qing Shui’s assistance, she had managed to achieve Sixth Divine Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu’s primary battle technique at the moment was her mutated Tiger Form. White Tiger Divine Grade. Each of them could last for up to four hours and each of their strength was four times her original strength. From here, it could be seen just how dangerous this battle technique was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. Now that he had helped her broke through to Seventh Divine Grade, if she were to condense the eight White Tigers and each of them possessed strength worth around 400 million Dao Force…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Damn it…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Qing Shui found it hard to believe. He immediately brought Yehuang Guwu along and left her room. He hadn’t met his family members yet but he had inquired about things going on with the clan and knew that everything was going well. This was also expected since Yehuang Guwu was here. Though she was at Sixth Divine Grade, her ability to condense eight White Tigers was already daunting enough. It could be said that with her in Qing Clan, Qing Shui had nothing to worry about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Few years had passed since they last met. She was still elegant like before and was wearing a plain court dress. Though it looked plain, she also looked very tidy as well. She had a very mature face with not even a single wrinkle. Both of her eyes looked moist, but at the same time, were also filled with wise and farsighted wisdom. They were just like the bright moon in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like before, it was still hard to tell her age. She didn’t seem all that old and yet, she was able to give people the impression that she was very mature, making them felt like they were children whenever in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a part of her aura. Compared to Canghai Mingyue, her aura was like different tunes that were played with equal skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had an exquisite figure and was unusually tall. The thing that was the most eye-catching about her was her unusually huge rear and her slender waist. She had two long and straight legs. Her breasts were bulging. Wearing her loose-fitting clothes, it made her all the more alluring. Everytime Qing Shui saw her, he would feel his blood boiling with desires.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a faint sexual desire on Yehuang Guwu’s face. However, both her eyes looked as bright as the moon. It was clear and tranquil. One would very easily lose their mind just by looking at eyes like this. She grabbed Qing Shui’s hands tightly and seemed to not want to let go at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me bring you to a place and give you a surprise.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seeing you here today is my biggest surprise. Nothing can be more surprising than that.”</span></p>

It sounded a bit neutral, giving people the urge that they want to hear her voice more. This was how the voice of a mature woman was supposed to be. It was another kind of charisma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui operated the Nine Continents Step Effect and very quickly, he managed to find a quiet place. Qing Shui helped raise her strength and naturally, that would mean she would have to take her clothes off. Considering they had been away from each other for so long, Qing Shui missed her a lot. Before he raised her strength, they were already stuck together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it was said that absence made the heart grow fonder, they had been separated from each other for too long. Yehuang Guwu was very active. She constantly demanded Qing Shui for more positions and cooperated well with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time everything quieted down, two hours had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yehuang Guwu was already satisfied and was lazily lying within Qing Shui’s grasp. On her charming face was a breathtaking flirtatious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, Qing Shui prepared himself for the Acupuncture procedures and so on. As he expected, Yehuang Guwu had achieved the middle level of Seventh Level of Divinity. Along the way, what came along with it was her Divine Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the other girls, Yehuang Guwu’s Divine Tribulation was even more demanding. However, she was able to form the White Tigers to help her resist against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Tribulation had made Yehuang Guwu’s foundation even more stable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he observed the current Yehuang Guwu, Qing Shui realized that he was back to how he was before. The reason was that Qing Shui noticed that his current strength, when measured thoroughly, was inferior to Yehuang Guwu’s. However, if he were to get in a serious battle with her, Qing Shui would undoubtedly win. The Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda, along with his own personal defensive capabilities, would definitely be able to block the attacks of the White Tigers that were worth around 400 million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s speed, body movement, his Sure Kill Heavenly Technique, along with his Nine Continents Mountain… If he were to use all of them with no hesitation, he would definitely be able to fend off against Yehuang Guwu easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Yehuang Guwu had managed to condense eight White Tigers with the strength worth of 400 million Dao Force. This caused Qing Shui to start thinking that this was how a Divine Grade Battle Technique was supposed to be. What was even more fearsome was that there was not just one, but eight of them.</span></p>
