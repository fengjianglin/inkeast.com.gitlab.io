But as of now, Qing Shui didn’t put all of these people in his eyes.</span></p>

A wounding prowess that was worth ten billion Dao Force wasn’t something which the people currently in front of him could withstand, let alone it was also stacked with the formidable force of Shield Attacks. It immediately blew away the warriors who tried to block against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain with his consciousness and used it to constantly massacre the people of the Ou Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people of the Zheng Clan who were initially ready to make their move, now stood there dumbfounded as they looked at Qing Shui’s tyrannical Magic Weapon that was massacring the warriors of the Ou Clan. It was killing the warriors like it was killing dogs. At this moment, they felt that Qing Shui was no different than a God himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surprises which the Nine Continents Mountain gave them were too huge. All the people that were killed were all Divine Grade Warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those were Divine Grade Warriors… Not just some white cabbages….</span></p>

Since the opponents already held the intention to kill everyone here, Qing Shui felt that there was no need for him to hold back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, Old Man Zheng was right there. Though he was hurt, he was in a deep joy. Things had indeed taken a new turn for them! There was now a glimmer of hope for the Zheng Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, let me take a look at your wounds.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Shichang had already ordered a few people to take care of the corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It will be worth it even if I die. It didn’t hurt at all.” The old man seemed very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he poked the old man’s body a few times. After that, he proceeded to connect the old man’s rib bones back. Qing Shui’s hand movements were very unique. Moreover, he also possessed the Force of Rebirth and Saintly Hands. Though he was unable to immediately fix the ribs perfectly, the old man could already act like a normal human, and it didn’t hurt anymore. After three days, he would definitely be fully recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, I am a physician. The Imperial Cuisine Hall which is under the Qing Clan is quite formidable.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wedding banquet continued. In fact, it got even livelier than before. Now, not only the Zheng Clan and the Qing Clan, but some of the most top-notch forces in the Dancing Phoenix Continent were also present. They witnessed Qing Shui eliminated the Ou Clan by himself. Moreover, the Ou Clan was a clan which managed to force the Zheng Clan to a dead-end with no retreating routes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, where is the Ou Clan’s main household located at?” Qing Shui asked casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man rotated his eyes and said out the name of a location. It was also in the Haohan Continent but he continued on and said, “The people from the Ou Clan who came today were the majority of strength which the Ou Clan possessed. The remaining ones were insignificant to cause a threat, but we also mustn’t leave them alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They can’t run away. Since the things here are almost done, let me go and settle the rest of the matter.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man let out a sigh. If he wasn’t hurt, he would have been able to take part in the Ou Clan massacre. Unfortunately, he was unable to do it at his current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you. You can ask anything from the Zheng Clan.” The old man said happily. He sounded very sincere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No no, we are relatives now. There is no way my Qing Clan won’t help if we see you in troubles.” Qing Shui responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, as long as there is one person alive in the Zheng Clan, the people of the Qing Clan will not be hurt in any way.” Old Man Zheng said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also knew that this was a way of showing their loyalty. It was also a kind of attitude. The old man was already someone with considerable age. If he didn’t get to see this today, he would have lived a wasted life. Initially, the Zheng Clan was supposed to be finished, but now, they all managed to stay in perfect shape. Furthermore, the Ou Clan was also gone. As for him personally, his clan managed to establish connections with a powerful clan through marriage. If after all of these, he still failed to have a good relationship with the Qing Clan, he would be better off dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ou Clan was located quite far away from the Dancing Phoenix Continent. But to Qing Shui, the distance was nothing much. With his Nine Continents Steps, he managed to arrive there within a short period of time. Hence, before the news even spread out from the Dancing Phoenix Continent, Qing Shui was already arrived in the Ou Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was unable to carry out a full clan massacre. After all, there were still some helpless women and children. He only killed those with formidable cultivations. To him, those people had done enough bad stuffs and their deaths were well-deserved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also took the chance to gather some of Ou Clan’s collections. Considering it was an aristocratic clan at Ou Clan’s level, they would still have quite a few decent stuff. However, Qing Shui was quite a picky person. He only looked for the best items and luckily, he happened to come across a few pretty good rocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, he still lacked a bit of them. The Big Dipper Sword in Qing Shui’s Dantian… By then, Qing Shui could refine it once more. Maybe after that, he would be able to force it out of his body. If he could really do that, he would finally be able to call it his own flying sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was reminded of the cultivators that existed in legends. They were capable of using swords and flying around with them. Qing Shui didn’t know about any flying swords, but the Big Dipper Swords had long since merge with his Dantian and became a part of his body. Furthermore, after being nurtured by his own body for the past ten years and further refined by the Divine Force within his Dantian, it could be considered as a Divine Artifact. Maybe in the future, it could be used together with the Nine Continents Mountain in battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Qing Shui was worried about was his ability to control it. Not only did he want to use it as one of his killer-moves, but in addition, he also had to control the Nine Continents Mountain. As the saying went, “one should never bite off more than what he could chew”. Nevertheless, it was still within his capabilities to control up to three thing items. The sharpness of the flying swords shouldn’t pose a problem to him. By then, it might turn out to be one of his biggest killer-moves too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning to the Qing Clan and staying for half a month, Qing Shui decided to leave. He was still able to leave this time without any worries. At the moment, Qing Clan could already be compared to an immortal palace. Furthermore, with the Zheng Clan as their relatives in the Dancing Phoenix Continent, there shouldn’t be any more problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the other girls would also continue to grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t want to see the sad scenes when he left. Hence, he left them a letter to tell them that he was leaving.</span></p>

He intended to calm himself down here. However, unlike before, Qing Shui felt that something was different about his body this time. There was a kind of rhythm which words couldn’t describe going on within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmph! It was the energy from before which came from the Opportunity Pills!</span></p>

How many days had passed since then? Prior to this, he couldn’t get any benefits from it. But now, he finally managed to feel something. Qing Shui was very surprised, what more abilities could he get? To Qing Shui, nothing could be better than becoming more powerful.</span></p>

However, the feeling was very insignificant. Following on, the energy started to move around his Dantian. The Paragon Vessel, Five Elements Divine Flags and even the Nine Continents Mountain were all being nurtured.</span></p>

His defensive prowess was now worth five billion Dao Force, increasing by a total of two billion Dao Force. His offensive prowess, on the other hand, increased by one billion Dao Force. This way, both Qing Shui’s offensive and defensive prowess were now worth five billion Dao Force.</span></p>

Since he had planned to travel to the True Nine Continents World, it was best if he could receive a boost in strength.</span></p>

The increase in strength was somehow related to the change in his Paragon Vessel. The little man in his Dantian had become even warmer and gentler. It was giving out a kind of stately aura. Other than that, Qing Shui also saw the Five Elements Divine Flag.</span></p>

It could be refined eight times per day with Blood Essence. As of now, ten checkpoints could be set in the maps of Five Elements Divine Flag. As the grade increased, more checkpoints would be available to be set in the map. The users could travel back and forth between these places. In a month, the user could be transported between the different checkpoints for up to three times. Each time the user transported, he could bring along lifeforms within the area of a hundred meters with him. As long as there were any lives detected within the set distance, it would be brought along automatically.</span></p>

There were no limitations to it. This was only exclusive to the two users of the Five Elements Divine Flag.</span></p>
