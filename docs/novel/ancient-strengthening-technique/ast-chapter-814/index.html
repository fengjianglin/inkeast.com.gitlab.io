 <p><strong></strong><strong>AST 814 - Earth Element Immortal Stone Flower, Rainbow Light City</strong></p>
 <p>It’s the One-Sided Guard effect of the Spiritual Snake Turtle…….</p>
 <p>The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal hadn’t upgraded. It was still the sixth level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, it had doubled in length and width compared to the usual. This reminded Qing Shui of the slight fluctuation of the realm that he felt at the moment when he kept the Spirited Snake Turtle. It was similar to that of the fluctuation that he felt when the realm upgraded in the past.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui felt that there were several additional spaces in the realm now. It should have had to do with the One-Sided Guard ability of the Spirited Snake Turtle. Other than this, Qing Shui wasn’t able to find any other reason for it.</p>
 <p>The extra spaces added to the realm made Qing Shui feel really happy because he had more demonic beasts now. In addition to that, his demonic beasts would also become bigger the moment they broke through, especially when the Fire Bird opened up its wings, it was too huge.</p>
 <p>The width and length of the realm doubled whereas its total area increased fourfold. This caused the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to feel a lot more spacious. At least the Fire Bird could now fly around the realm.</p>
 <p>The size of the lake also more than doubled. The thing which surprised Qing Shui the most was that the size of the “Poisonous Liquid Lake” that he made a bit later had also increased by more than double.</p>
 <p>It seemed like the things that he changed with his consciousness in the realm wouldn’t only be conserved, it would even be approved by the realm itself. Now, Qing Shui was standing by the lake and looking at the stationary Spiritual Snake Turtle at the bottom of the lake. It seemed to be really at peace now. At a spot not so distant away from here, Clam and Golden Medicinal Turtle could also be seen. Qing Shui only came out after conversing with the Spiritual Snake Turtle through his Spiritual Sense.</p>
 <p>After going through a simple telepathic communication, Qing Shui found out that the change in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was related to the One-sided Guard Ability of the Spirited Snake Turtle. Since he had tamed it, as long as it was alive, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would sustain its current form. But if it was to perish, the realm itself would recover its past appearance.</p>
 <p>With the current strength of the Spirited Snake Turtle, it couldn’t be much help to Qing Shui, hence, he made up his mind to let the Spirited Snake Turtle stand-guard in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. In any case, it had always been in the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp before and hadn’t tired of it. This way, not only would there be a lot more space in the realm, the realm itself would be more abundant with spiritual energy as well. In other words, it would be more suitable for plants, animals and Demonic Beasts to grow.</p>
 <p>After staying there for a while, Qing Shui exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Seeing that the jade-like stones and plants here had good quality and that the current Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had a lot of extra space, he threw it in without much thought. Not only this, he even set up a philosophical decoration in the realm according to this place. After all, this place looked quite beautiful. In the future, there would be another splendorous and majestic place for him to rest in the realm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked around and found a few of the Spirited Snake Turtle’s collection. It mostly consisted of precious spiritual stones. It was a kind of stone filled with spiritual qi. Furthermore, it came in quite a huge quantity. The stones which he tossed into the realm previously also had spiritual qi, just not as abundant as those inside the small stones.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t hold back and immediately threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed the place yet again and when he found there was nothing left, he walked out of it. Qing Shui took the Water Repelling Pearls and and made his way to the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp. Since he was able to get some good stuff with the Pure Gold Fishing Rod, he wanted to see if there was any precious stuff at the bottom of the lake.</p>
 <p>Considering that he had even captured the Spirited Snake Turtle, the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp wasn’t that scary anymore. Qing Shui stepped on the rocky surface of the bottom of the pond. There were stones, bones and other things on the ground.</p>
 <p>Because of the Water Repelling Pearls he possessed, it was impossible for fish and prawns to appear in the surroundings. However, he was still able to spot a few fish and prawns at a spot not so far away. The resistance force of the Water Repelling Pearls would repel them into the surroundings along with the water.</p>
 <p>Eh!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the flower nearby here which was growing in between the stone crack. Its entire body was silvery-white colored. It was something which could be easily neglected if not observed carefully. It was roughly around a palm tall and a thumb thick, yet it gave people the impression that it was really sturdy and strong like a pencil.</p>
 <p>Immortal Stone Flower!</p>
 <p>The Earth Element Flower of the Five Elements Flower. Unfortunately, it was still too young. Luckily he managed to notice it early or else it would have been drowned by the water.</p>
 <p>He moved the Immortal Stone Flower to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It’s not something to be worried about because no matter what elements it was, it would still be able to grow in the soil of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The best nurturing place for Earth Element Flower was on the ground because the stones were also earth attributed.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui continued to look through the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp. Unfortunately, he only ran into stuff that wasn’t considered that precious. If he was not mistaken, the Art Maestro was the only person who came here. In fact, his stuff had also been taken away by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what the Art Maestro came to the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp for. He actually died at the claws of a Grade One Martial Saint Demonic Beast…… Qing Shui shook his head and flew above the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp.</p>
 <p>He had a lot of gains on his trip this time. Both his Nature Energy and Immovable Mountains went up by a grade each. Furthermore, his Nature Energy had also reached great heights. It would revolve on its own with zero consumption, not to mention its strength had also doubled. Common poisons, illusory attacks and mental attacks, when before the heaven and earth’s pure energy that Qing Shui possessed, were all only thin papers which would easily be pierced through with pencils.</p>
 <p>His strength once again took another huge leap.</p>
 <p>The breakthrough of the Nature Energy let Qing Shui see a ray of hope. Perhaps, he was not far away from making another breakthrough. He was yearning for the Seventh Heavenly Layer. As long as he achieved that, he had a feeling that he would have the authority to voice his opinion wherever he went.</p>
 <p>The World of the Nine Continents was getting more and more exciting.</p>
 <p>As he went back to Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store, he happened to see Canghai Mingyue about to take the two little fellows out. Di Qing was also beside her. At the moment she spotted Qing Shui, she smiled, “Qing Shui, Mingyue is going to bring the little fellows out shopping. We’re afraid that we might run into bad people, why don’t you come with us?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose. He had no choice but to go along. Qing Shui blushed as he remembered what Di Qing had said previously. Meeting bad people in Hundred Miles City… It should be relatively difficult for them to run into bad people even across the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, hug me!” Qing Yin opened up her arms and ran towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and picked her up. He kissed her cheeks with all his might, causing the little fellow to let out a loud and clear laugh.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue was pulling Qing Zun while observing Qing Shui’s incomparably warm smile. Di Qing on the other hand, went blank as she saw the warm scene in front of her.</p>
 <p>Along the way, a lot of people would greet Qing Shui and the group. The two children were fascinated with everything they saw. Di Qing carried Qing Zun, she would buy the little fellow whatever he wanted.</p>
 <p>Every time that happened, Qing Yin would also ask for the same thing. Hence, Qing Shui would go back to the place again to get her one.</p>
 <p>When that happened, Di qing would smile and look at him, causing Qing Shui to feel a bit confused. Canghai Mingyue on the other hand, stood to the side and smiled while looking at them. Deep down, she thought to herself that her husband was truly destined to have many women around him.</p>
 <p>At the blink of an eye, another few days passed. Qing Shui and the group were also already prepared to go back to the Continent’s Capital. On their way back this time, a lot of people from Hundred Miles City showed up to send them off. There were people from Shi Clan, Firecloud Blacksmith Store, Xiang Clan, Feng Clan, Yu Clan. Actually, basically all of the aristocratic clans in Hundred Miles City showed up. There were also a lot of ordinary people who showed up because Qing Shui wasn’t just the protector of the Hundred Miles City, he was now the person ruling the entire Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>Rainbow Light City!</p>
 <p>After twenty days, Qing Shui and the group arrived at Rainbow Light City. He planned to rest here for a few days. Even if the adults were able to bear the long journey, the children wouldn’t be able to.</p>
 <p>The Rainbow Light Country was the strongest country in Greencloud Continent. It stood firmly among the top ten countries. The strongest area in Rainbow Light Country was the Rainbow Light City. For now it didn’t really bother Qing Shui if he was able to squeeze himself into the top ten of Greencloud Continent, because here he didn’t fear anyone, nor did he fear any kind of presence.</p>
 <p>Traveller’s Inn!</p>
 <p>It was a decent restaurant. Qing Shui and the group stepped into the inn. There was quite a decent amount of people in Qing Clan. But it wasn’t considered to be that large an amount because the number of people in adventure groups across the World of the Nine Continents would have easily exceeded the amount of people in the clan.</p>
 <p>“Hello, welcome to the inn!” The female servant at the entrance of the door politely expressed a smile at Qing Shui and the group.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded and entered the restaurant. Currently, the people from Qing Clan also bore an extraordinary presence. Among them, there were already a few empire-topping beauties who could topple cities. For a moment, it would trigger other people’s guesses of the history of the clan.</p>
 <p>The restaurant was top-notch in terms of both decoration and structure. The design of the building resembled that of a watchtower, giving people a unique feeling. There seemed to be very few private rooms here. However, there were multi-colored partitions in the hall to divide the large halls into rooms that served as bed chambers. Certainly, the guests who decided to stay in the inn could also choose to enjoy their meal in their rooms.</p>
 <p>Upon entering the restaurant, a young woman led Qing Shui and his group upstairs. The female servant asked while leading them, “Mister, are you here for a meal or for an overnight stay?”</p>
 <p>“Please help me look for a room first. We will talk about eating later.” Qing Shui said</p>
 <p>“Alright.”</p>
 <p>They walked all the way up to the fourth floor. Qing Shui booked the biggest room straight away. As soon as he went in, he found a huge living room. There were kitchen, toilet and bedrooms in the surroundings. In addition to that, there was also a huge balcony.</p>
 <p>“Are you satisfied with this?” The female servant stood beside the door and asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I’m satisfied with it. Alright then, please serve us the best dishes you have here. Serve us two sets of each of the dishes.” Qing Shui passed a silver note to the female servant.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” The female servant bowed down and left.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, on the fifth floor of the hall, there were roughly ten people gathered there. Among the people there, six of them were young men who looked younger than forty years old. As for the remaining five people, three of them were middle-aged men while the other two were elderly men.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Dan, they’re obviously no ordinary people. Are you sure that you want to pick on them?” One of the middle-aged men knitted his brows and asked.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Xu, could it be that you’re scared? Dan Clan has never feared anyone in Rainbow Light City.” The handsome young man said arrogantly.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Dan, in Rainbow Light City, Dan Clan might be the clan with the highest authority. No one would dare to pick on them. But have you ever thought about outside of Rainbow Light City?” The middle-aged man said cautiously.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a young man rushed in, “ Young Master Dan, it’s clear now.”</p>
 <p>“Say it!”</p>
 <p>“They registered it under the name Wu Ci and they are staying in room number 3,” The young man answered quickly.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Xu, what do you think? I have already said before that the place was filled with hidden experts. From their looks, they look more like businessmen who know very little martial arts,” the man called Young Master Shao said in joy.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man called Uncle Xu didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>“Dan Peng, last time, it was precisely because of women as well. Have you forgotten about the consequences?” An elderly man said with his head down.</p>
 <p>“Third Elder, of course not, I was grounded for three years. Don’t worry, this time, I’ll make sure to do it neatly.” Despite what Dan Peng said, he thought to himself that if he was able to get the girls, he wouldn’t mind being grounded for six years or even die.</p>
 <p>Women was the only thing he loved. Without women, he would never feel satisfied. Even during the time he was grounded, he never cut out women from his life. There has always been people helping him in doing so. Aside from being lecherous, he has proven himself to be the most outstanding candidate among the young generations of Dan Clan.</p>
