 <p><strong>AST 620 - The Evolved Primordial Flame and its terrifying power!</strong></p>
 <p>As time passed, Qing Shui began to notice that many things weren’t as simple they seemed from the surface. People dared to make such a statement because they must have gathered enough evidence to prove that the Sima Clan was in a close relationship with Ten Thousand Poisons Sect.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui had hurt Sima Huoyu was because he had wanted to avoid more troubles during this time. After all, there were already too many people who wanted Qing Shui dead in the Seven Stars Country. For now, the only person who he could truly depend on was himself.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, I'll be more cautious.” Qing Shui expressed his gratitude to Di Qing.</p>
 <p>The two immediately went back into the ninth floor of Four Seas Inn through the windows. When they noticed that their dishes had been served, they once again settled down in their seats.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the two Di sisters were supposed to have been enjoying their moment together until Sima Huoyu interrupted them. After finishing dinner, the three went back to the room together. Since it was already really late, Di Qing didn't plan to go back to the Di clan as well.</p>
 <p>“This is for you. I promised you this the other day.” Qing Shui took out the Metal Element Fruits of Five Elements when they were back in the room.</p>
 <p>“Ah! You really meant it!” Di Qing first reacted in surprise. After that, she happily looked at the ten golden fruits and began to show an alluring smile.</p>
 <p>If Di Chen really ended up with this man, Di Qing would be the pair’s sister-in-law. However, the sister-in-law would oftentimes have affairs with the sister’s husband. This had been the case since ancient times.</p>
 <p>“I was supposed to give you these earlier, but then I was in a rush, which is why I waited until now.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I heard about it from my sister! Mingyue gave birth to beautiful twins too, congratulations!” Di Qing responded as she took the fruits with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Since when did you learn to be so formal?” Qing Shui smiled humbly as he tried to tease her. This woman exuded a mysterious aura which felt really similar to Di Chen’s. Although she was normally really disobedient, Qing Shui felt that she was a bit soft.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't aware that, a while before, she had actually thought a lot about him. For a moment, Di Qing went blank as she looked at him, and it felt as if everything has changed.</p>
 <p>Once someone began to feel different about a person, it would unknowingly affect every single one of his or her actions. This kind of change was a kind of subconscious act. In other words, it was a change that even she herself didn’t notice.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, she was starting to feel a bit complicated!</p>
 <p>“Treat my sister well! Or else I'm not going to let you off that easily!” Di Qing blushed as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui touched his nose and smiled. He didn't really know how to react, hence, he nodded: “I feel really stressed whenever I'm with your sister. Do you think it's better if I offer her out to other people?”</p>
 <p>“Damn you, what kind of a person are you to say these sorts of things?!” Di Chen embarrassingly shouted at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Since your sister and I are together, we are already considered to be relatives! Hehe.” Qing Shui glanced towards Di Qing as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Sister… Yeah… Then I think I shall address you as my brother-in-law……” Di Qing looked at Qing Shui blankly, as if she had just come to realize it. After that, she gave him an expression as if she had come across an extremely bizarre incident.</p>
 <p>“Exactly!” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Don't even think about it, I'm older than you! I will never address you as my brother-in-law!” Di Qing shook her head and said grumpily. She was the only one who knew that age wasn't the true reason she despised this way of addressing him.</p>
 <p>“It's ok if you don't want to do it, calm down.” Qing Shui touched his nose and said in a joking manner.</p>
 <p>Di Chen seemed to have noticed something. Even though she and Di Qing didn't grow up together, they had still spent a bit of time with each other during their childhood. When they were older, they had also stayed with each other for a while in Green Cloud Continent. Hence, the two could be considered to have known each other quite well. The problem was that Di Chen was still unable to confirm her suspicion.</p>
 <p>“Well, let's wait until when you are able to topple the whole World of the Nine Continents. I'll address you then as my brother-in-law, ok?” Di Qing smiled as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>That beautiful and alluring expression of hers stunned Qing Shui. Slowly, he turned his head to the side to try to avoid her bright eyes and beautiful face.</p>
 <p>“At the moment, you are much more beautiful compared to the time when I first met you. In any case, you are still my relative… This is for you, so that you can reach Martial Saint earlier.” Qing Shui took out a medicinal pill bag and passed it to Di Qing.</p>
 <p>There were at least one or two of each of Qing Shui’s medicinal pills. He had even prepared some fruits in it.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, since when have I not looked beautiful?” Di Qing responded grumpily. After that, she moved her sight to the medicinal pills which Qing Shui had given her.</p>
 <p>“I'm going to rest for a while. I'll let your sister explain what those pills are and their functions.” After that, Qing Shui went towards the study room. It was almost time for him to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed the door as soon as he went into the study room. He spotted the shelf at the corner and went towards it. Since there was still time, he decided to take a quick look through the shelf to see what kind of books the inn had.</p>
 <p>He randomly took out a book. It was ‘The Continent’s Chronicle’, a history book. Qing Shui fiddled through it for a while before putting it back on the shelf. Since Qing Shui had known about such history before, he felt that there wasn’t a need for him to look through it again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never thought that he would be able to find such an ancient book on the shelf. The room he was in must be one of the best rooms in Four Seas Inn. Qing Shui wouldn’t even be surprised if there were any godly training methods here.</p>
 <p>‘Fun Facts about the Continent’</p>
 <p>‘Unusual Demonic Beast’s Encyclopedia’</p>
 <p>‘Art of Observing Females’</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spotted a few letters on the book he was holding. He was quite surprised and opened it to see if there was anything interesting in it. Since he was still free, he felt that this would be a good way for him to pass time.</p>
 <p>There was a saying that “One’s physical appearance was often related to his or her personality. For instance, if a person had a gentle and soft attitude, his facial expression as well as their eyes would also appear to be calm and gentle.” This was the first sentence of the book. Qing Shui found it somewhat reasonable.</p>
 <p>The main feature about it was “observing”, which in other words, meant looking. Normally, when you were observing someone, you would often start from their head and slowly proceed down to their legs. The first thing you would look at was the person’s eyebrows.</p>
 <p>According to the ‘Art of Observing Females’, girls with eyebrows that were unusually curved in an arch shape like a crescent moon, extending all the way from one side of their eye to the other, were normally incomparably kind and helpful. They possessed a really soft and gentle heart. Women who possessed really beautiful eyebrows were usually really loyal, kind and gentle.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, women with thick and droopy eyebrows that curved downwards were often really horny and dirty-minded. That was what led to their brows looking really messy and droopy. As for women with slightly sharper eyebrows, they leaned more towards the kind who were really cheap. Such women unusually had envious personalities and tended to have really short lives.</p>
 <p>Women with really thin, clear brows colored bright black often turned out to be good, virtuous wives.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>According to the ‘Art of Observing Females’, bushy brows indicated that a woman was a virgin. Often, the brows were somehow related to the genitals region. Once a woman lost her virginity, her eyebrows would begin to spread out from each other. As for those women who still retained their virginity, every single one of their brows would look soft and gentle, facing only one direction. For women who had lost their virginity, there would often be only a slight difference in the direction which their brows faced. If one was to look at it more closely, it wouldn’t be that noticeable.</p>
 <p>Additionally, females with sparkling eyes were often overwhelmed with lust and were usually promiscuous. Eyes represent body energy level and Shenqi. This type of women had an unusually strong desire to fuck guys. Normally, a single man wouldn’t be able to satisfy them.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Females with large boobs often had very sparse genital hair. Some would have hair only around the corner of their genital parts while others would have none at all. Only dumb women had a small amount of short hair that would be soft, curly and light-colored. The opposite applied to smart women.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui: “......”</p>
 <p>There was one more theory that referred to the “Heavenly Court and Earthly Pavilion”. In this context, the Heavenly Court referred to women’s forehead, whereas the “Earthly Pavilion” referred to their lower jaw. Heavenly Court belonged to the yang category, meaning it represented males. Earthly Pavilion belonged to the yin category, which stood for females. Hence, a woman’s fortune was all decided by their lower jaw.</p>
 <p>Because women had more yin energy, they would often end up with a thinner and smoother body. The part where their yin energy gathered would be at their lower jaw.</p>
 <p>The most good-looking lower jaw would essentially be smooth and round.</p>
 <p>Women with fat butts and slender waists would have a higher chance of getting pregnant than normal women.</p>
 <p>Nonetheless, the most important part of a woman was her legs. Other than a woman’s lower jaw, her legs were one of the places where most of her yin energy would gather as well. Furthermore, it was also the part of her body which was the most sensitive to sex.</p>
 <p>A woman’s legs would be most attractive if they were dainty and delicate. This represented a gentle and reserved kind of beauty. On the other hand, if her legs looked thicker, it would be a kind of masculine beauty. The feature that came second after the shape of her legs was her foot. Women with thin feet would often trigger a kind of impulsive emotion in men to protect them. Other than that, women would also have curvy and soft legs.</p>
 <p>There were some descriptions which were more explicit. As Qing Shui looked through them, he felt more and more stirred up.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui finished reading the book, it had been more than half an hour. He put down the book and went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. As he thought about the contents of the book, he strongly agreed with its general viewpoints even though he didn’t really believe all of the things it said. He felt that the person who wrote the book ‘Art of Observing Females’ was definitely an expert in sex.</p>
 <p>Other than that, Qing Shui had also randomly flipped through the back content of the book. He noticed that there were contents about women’s body, bones, essence as well as aura.</p>
 <p>Cultivate!</p>
 <p>Ever since he had been in Seven Stars Country, the people that he had encountered made him feel that he was still too weak. Even just protecting himself had also become a problem. Despite that, there was a very small chance that he would be able to take a huge leap in his strength compared to his current abilities.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui put more emphasis towards his battle techniques, the level of his Tiger Form, Taichi Fist and his Sword Technique. He was also focusing more on the cultivation of his Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint as well as his Elephant Form and Bear Form.</p>
 <p>At present, the progression of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique slowed down as Qing Shui was at the Elephant’s Form. Very soon, it would achieve the Large Success Stage. However, to Qing Shui, the dragon, phoenix and roc stage still seemed so far away.</p>
 <p>Refine the medicines!</p>
 <p>After cultivating for a while, Qing Shui decided to go and refine some medicinal pills. The grey Primordial Flame which was one feet long looked incomparably thick and solid as it spouted out from Qing Shui’s palm.</p>
 <p>Until now, Qing Shui was still confused why the flame felt as if it had a life of its own. He couldn’t feel the hotness of the flame, but he could feel the energy of the flame itself. It was as if the flame belonged to him: he didn’t fear it, just like a Beast Tamer and his beast.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt a change in the flame on his hand. It happened so instantaneously that even his eyes were unable to catch up. The Primordial Flame which was a foot long suddenly condensed. The flame was two inches shorter than before. Furthermore, there was a simple, unadorned grey color added onto the flame.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Flame once again went up by one grade!</p>
 <p>It went up by a grade without any signs…...</p>
 <p>This time, both the burning ability and the temperature of the flame went up by a few folds. Furthermore, Qing Shui also felt as if he had established a close connection with the Primordial Flame. It was as if the Primordial Flame possessed a life of its own.</p>
 <p>Coincidentally, the medicine in the Demon Refining Furnace was also done being refined. Hence, Qing Shui left the spot.</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui swung his right hand, a bunch of flame immediately shot out of it. The speed at which the flame travelled was shockingly fast. With his subconscious mind, Qing Shui has actually thrown out the Primordial Flame the same way he did with his Hidden Weapon.</p>
 <p>The grey Primordial Flame… Qing Shui felt that Primordial Flame that had just gotten a few times stronger managed to collide with the edge of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal before disappearing into the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected for the Primordial Flame to actually turn out like this once it went up by a grade. He took out an unusually tough metal which was the size of a human’s head and placed it on a spot around fifty metres away from him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again swung his hand!</p>
 <p>A flame almost the size of a fist was ignited.</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>Half of the metal which ordinary swords and knives would be unable to scratch was actually melted by Qing Shui’s Primordial Flames. Unfortunately, the Primordial Flame which left his body was only able to last for a short while without the support provided by his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Nevertheless, its ability to cause destruction was still really terrifying. If it had been a human, that person would have been pierced through directly.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui experimented with it over and over again. As he did so, he felt increasingly happy. If he was to combine his speed, his Hidden Weapon Techniques and his upgraded Primordial Flames together, it would definitely be enough to instill fear in both warriors and Demonic Beasts stronger than him. The happy Qing Shui continuously experimented on the terrifying burning ability of the Primordial Flame.</p>
 <p>Seeing as the Primordial Flame was still just a bunch of flame yet already possessed such a terrifying power, Qing Shui thought to himself if he could further strengthen it and increase its duration, he could increase the amount of the flame that he released.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about the bracelet which helped to boost strength. Unfortunately… It was already destroyed...</p>
 <p>There was still a bit of flame left which could be released.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt as if the window in front of him opened...</p>
