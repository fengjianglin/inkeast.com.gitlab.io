  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 498 - Consuming the Great Revitalizing Pellet, Incomparably Overbearing</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui could feel a chill creep up his back. What’s with that speed? That strength?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had previously planned to call out his Fire Bird so that he could escape. Perhaps with the aid of the strength from the skies, his Fire Bird will be able to kill at least a single One Horned Silver Wolf. Luckily, he had not done so...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen did not attack Qing Shui, it only stared at Qing Shui with its blue azure eyes. The remaining wolves however rushed towards Qing Shui again.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three sets of claws, in addition to three silhouettes, which created a flurry of shadows in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui panicked a little this time. This time, it would not be as easy because he saw that the body of the Silver Wolf Queen had tensed up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ll just fight first!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui channeled his abilities to their peak and he held his Violet Gold Divine Shield with him. The Big Dipper Sword in his right hand pierced through the head of a One Horned Silver Wolf who did not dodge in time. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bish!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Crash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was sent flying. Qing Shui noted that the Silver Wolf Queen had started moving again. Its speed was now faster than before and its the jumps were higher &nbsp;than before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui boosted himself with all his additional attributes. At this point in time, Qing Shui felt helpless he might not be able to withstand the next blow. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Divinity Protection!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seemingly Sealed Shut!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blue Lotus Art!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fifth Wave!!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui used his power to protect his heart, pushing his strength to its limit.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Fifth Wave had only reach the third level but Qing Shui managed to repel the Silver Wolf Queen. It was sent flying while Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword struck the Silver Wolf Queen’s head directly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was appalled to find that nothing happened to the wolf!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Copper head, metal tail, tofu waist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shocked to find that the Silver Wolf Queen was actually able to withstand such a massive attack. Even though the Silver Wolf Queen was only hit by three waves of force, but such an outcome was unexpected. If that was the case, how formidable was this Silver Wolf Queen?!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui felt like a normal person who was knocked down by a large truck. His whole body felt like it had disintegrated.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He flew backwards.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A stream of fresh blood spewed out in mid air!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen actually pounced at Qing Shui again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Shui endured the intense pain and consumed his Great Revitalizing Pellet without any reservation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effect of Great Revitalizing Pellet: Increase total stats by 20 percent, increase lifespan by 20 years, heals internal injuries within a short time, total stats will double within an one-hour span post-consumption, which will be followed by the user’s abilities being reduced to parity to a normal person’s for an entire month. The effects will only be limited to one pellet. Additional consumption will only cure internal injuries, extend the duration of the hour that stats are doubled, the user’s ability will still be reduced to a normal person for one month.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These were the effects that Qing Shui knew about, he did not cared what it was like in reality. Now, he could only place all his hope on this Great Revitalizing Pellet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just when the Silver Wolf Queen touched Qing Shui’s body, a soft glow slowly appeared. A large sacred holy Golden Buddha appeared behind Qing Shui, it was stately and solemn.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Crash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was once again assaulted by the Silver Wolf Queen!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui did not retreat. A very faint golden aura enveloped his body. This golden aura deflected the Silver Wolf Queen’s attack.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the perverse changes in his body. His blood flowed faster and faster. His Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique also cycled around his body quicker and quicker.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He made a breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dashed towards the Silver Wolf Queen. At that moment, he felt the gains he had made with his breakthrough to the Cloudmist Steps of the Truth Realm. Instantaneously, Qing Shui felt as if he was stepping on clouds and fog, it was fantastic.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could feel his strength being raised insanely. Qing Shui knew that it was due to the effect of the Great Revitalizing Pellet. It was said to last only for an hour but that was sufficient.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could feel the gradual changes in the tenacity and strength of his meridians, his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique gradually accumulated in his dantian and slowly grew more powerful...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s body was filled with a type of explosive force, at this moment, he felt that he could flatten an entire mountain with a single blow!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This suddenly increase in strength was not a comfortable process. Even though his overall body would be strengthened at the same time, he felt as though he was suddenly infused with a &nbsp;huge amount of Xiantian Qi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The massive sudden improvement to his meridians, dantian, bones and internal organs created an immeasurable amount of pain that seemed to even reach his soul.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thankfully, it was only for a short while!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly freed himself from the pain. An incomparably comforting feeling took its place, it was a powerful feeling of confidence and faith in himself. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His total stats had increased by one fold. Even though it was was only his base stats, Qing Shui could feel that he was now at the strength of slightly more than 13 countries. His speed and defense had also increase immensely!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was such a terrifying amount of strength! Qing Shui did not immediately break through to the Martial Saint level. According to the Old Ancestor, he would have immediately entered the Realm of Martial Saint, he didn’t know why he didn’t have that feeling.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The surviving two One Horned Silver Wolves rushed towards Qing Shui, not even fearing death!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui channelled his Qi to its peak and stomped his foot!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was still that Mighty Elephant Stomp. But now it could generate the strength of 17 countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A gigantic chasm extended through the ground, as if the ground was being cleaved open. The surrounding mountains collapsed. In an instant, the ravine was filled up with the fallen rocks.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the Divine Black Crows in the air flew away in a panic. Countless One Horned Silver Wolves were buried and crushed in the process. Qing Shui stood atop the ravine which was now flat ground and stared at the Silver Wolf Queen.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was actually a perfect beast with the strength of 10 countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All aspects of it stats were at the level of 10 countries. This was a demonic beast at the Peak Martial King level. Its capabilities were among the very best within all Peak Martial King demonic beasts. There were some Peak Martial King demonic beasts which had the strength of more than 10 countries but with speed and defense much lower than 10 countries.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, this beast in front of him, will all stats at 10 countries, could easily defeat other beasts that had the strength of 12 countries but with their speed or defense at the level of seven to eight countries.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was saying that a demonic beast with perfect stats would definitely reach the Martial Saint level!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen stared vigilantly at the human who had abruptly become very powerful. This beast was innately cunning, it seemed to have realized something and suddenly turned to run away.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Escape?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Using his Cloudmist Steps at the Obscure Realm combined with his currently formidable capabilities, Qing Shui chased the Silver Wolf Queen like a speed demon. At the same time, he took out his Crimson Dragon Bow and Bone Arrows.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Little guy, I nearly lost my life to you. How can I let you go in a good condition?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Creak!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While chasing, Qing Shui pulled his Crimson Dragon Bow to its maximum, he then imbued it with all his strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Whimper!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strong Silver Wolf Queen was blasted away. Qing Shui was shocked to find that the Silver Wolf Queen only sustained a very light injury.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unwilling to give up, Qing Shui shot at it again. It was still only slight injured again. That small wound was nothing to the Silver Wolf Queen, but the impact was sufficient to blast it off its feet, causing it to yelp twice each time.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Fine, How about the Poison Dragon Arrow?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of his Poison Dragon Arrow. His heart was filled with a sort of fervour and his face changed and he quickly took out his Poison Dragon Arrow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui targeted the shots he had planted on the butt area of the magnificent Silver Wolf Queen. Fresh blood was slowly dripping from the wound, it was just a bit of blood but that was enough.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used his Poison Dragon Arrow and locked onto one of the previous wounds.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Creak!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Whimper whimper!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Maybe because it felt that this attack was going to be strong, the Silver Wolf Queen whimpered melancholily as it ran. The howl even caused Qing Shui’s hands to tremble.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a sort of objection in the howl, an attachment, a sort of helplessness. It will filled with resentment and helplessness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. A demonic beast at such a level, perhaps only with the intelligence of at least a five year old could actually produce such a complicated howl.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the midst of it, it even turned to look at Qing Shui. He could see the blue azure eyes that begged him...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui spotted the row of nipples on the Silver Wolf Queen’s abdominal area. He could tell that it was still nursing…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly became soft-hearted. Be it humans or demonic beasts, nothing could be said about whether one was above the other, but love was equal to all...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly brought down the Crimson Dragon Bow in his hands and even stopped.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen stopped as well. It gave Qing Shui two low whimpers. It was different from the previous bright howl. Qing Shui could not tell what it meant. Qing Shui just waved his hands signaling to the Silver Wolf Queen to leave. Anyway, Qing Shui also planned to leave. He did not plan to stay here for long as he had decided not to covet that luscious Silver Wolf Queen’s fur. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen gave Qing Shui another two low howls.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Huh?” Qing Shui realized that the Silver Wolf Queen did not leave, it seemed to have decided to follow him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked slowly towards the wolf. As the effect of the Great Revitalizing Pellet would still last a while, Qing Shui was not afraid.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like this, Qing Shui traversed through the mountains quickly with the Silver Wolf Queen by his side. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still did not understand why the Silver Wolf Queen had decided to follow him. At least, Qing Shui was not worried for now. Even though Flowerfruit Mountain proved to be one of the most dangerous regions in the Greencloud continent, the Silver Wolf Queen amongst the demonic beasts at its grade, was within the biggest clout. It had 10,000 over ‘followers,’ and it itself was extremely powerful.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As the effects of the Great Revitalizing Pellet faded, Qing Shui felt more and more cautious. Qing Shui looked at the fast sprinting Silver Wolf Queen in front of him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui even thought of running away or perhaps just killing it right now...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, Qing Shui decided to just follow silently after looking at the way that the Silver Wolf Queen seemed to treat him without putting up any defenses against him, and its previously ‘thoughtful’ barks. Qing Shui decided that in the worst case scenario, he would just enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal when the effects faded. After he was no longer in that weakened state, he would come out from the realm. At that time, he would still have two Great Revitalizing Pellets to use.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, he would eat another pellet….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With that in mind, Qing Shui felt more confident.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen sprinted forward with its full speed. It knew that the human behind it could catch up to her speed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He still had half an hour!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A river!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a fire on top of the mountain?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a forest of Fire Maples which were just like flames.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wasn’t this the location of the treasure on the second treasure map?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was totally stunned. He may not have found Goddess Peak but he was actually going to find the treasure on the second treasure map?</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Fifth Wave had only reach the third level but Qing Shui managed to repel the Silver Wolf Queen. It was sent flying while Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword struck the Silver Wolf Queen’s head directly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was appalled to find that nothing happened to the wolf!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Copper head, metal tail, tofu waist!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shocked to find that the Silver Wolf Queen was actually able to withstand such a massive attack. Even though the Silver Wolf Queen was only hit by three waves of force, but such an outcome was unexpected. If that was the case, how formidable was this Silver Wolf Queen?!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui felt like a normal person who was knocked down by a large truck. His whole body felt like it had disintegrated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He flew backwards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A stream of fresh blood spewed out in mid air!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen actually pounced at Qing Shui again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Shui endured the intense pain and consumed his Great Revitalizing Pellet without any reservation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effect of Great Revitalizing Pellet: Increase total stats by 20 percent, increase lifespan by 20 years, heals internal injuries within a short time, total stats will double within an one-hour span post-consumption, which will be followed by the user’s abilities being reduced to parity to a normal person’s for an entire month. The effects will only be limited to one pellet. Additional consumption will only cure internal injuries, extend the duration of the hour that stats are doubled, the user’s ability will still be reduced to a normal person for one month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These were the effects that Qing Shui knew about, he did not cared what it was like in reality. Now, he could only place all his hope on this Great Revitalizing Pellet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just when the Silver Wolf Queen touched Qing Shui’s body, a soft glow slowly appeared. A large sacred holy Golden Buddha appeared behind Qing Shui, it was stately and solemn.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Crash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was once again assaulted by the Silver Wolf Queen!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui did not retreat. A very faint golden aura enveloped his body. This golden aura deflected the Silver Wolf Queen’s attack.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the perverse changes in his body. His blood flowed faster and faster. His Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique also cycled around his body quicker and quicker.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He made a breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dashed towards the Silver Wolf Queen. At that moment, he felt the gains he had made with his breakthrough to the Cloudmist Steps of the Truth Realm. Instantaneously, Qing Shui felt as if he was stepping on clouds and fog, it was fantastic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could feel his strength being raised insanely. Qing Shui knew that it was due to the effect of the Great Revitalizing Pellet. It was said to last only for an hour but that was sufficient.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could feel the gradual changes in the tenacity and strength of his meridians, his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique gradually accumulated in his dantian and slowly grew more powerful...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s body was filled with a type of explosive force, at this moment, he felt that he could flatten an entire mountain with a single blow!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This suddenly increase in strength was not a comfortable process. Even though his overall body would be strengthened at the same time, he felt as though he was suddenly infused with a &nbsp;huge amount of Xiantian Qi.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The massive sudden improvement to his meridians, dantian, bones and internal organs created an immeasurable amount of pain that seemed to even reach his soul.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thankfully, it was only for a short while!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly freed himself from the pain. An incomparably comforting feeling took its place, it was a powerful feeling of confidence and faith in himself. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His total stats had increased by one fold. Even though it was was only his base stats, Qing Shui could feel that he was now at the strength of slightly more than 13 countries. His speed and defense had also increase immensely!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was such a terrifying amount of strength! Qing Shui did not immediately break through to the Martial Saint level. According to the Old Ancestor, he would have immediately entered the Realm of Martial Saint, he didn’t know why he didn’t have that feeling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The surviving two One Horned Silver Wolves rushed towards Qing Shui, not even fearing death!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui channelled his Qi to its peak and stomped his foot!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was still that Mighty Elephant Stomp. But now it could generate the strength of 17 countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A gigantic chasm extended through the ground, as if the ground was being cleaved open. The surrounding mountains collapsed. In an instant, the ravine was filled up with the fallen rocks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the Divine Black Crows in the air flew away in a panic. Countless One Horned Silver Wolves were buried and crushed in the process. Qing Shui stood atop the ravine which was now flat ground and stared at the Silver Wolf Queen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was actually a perfect beast with the strength of 10 countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All aspects of it stats were at the level of 10 countries. This was a demonic beast at the Peak Martial King level. Its capabilities were among the very best within all Peak Martial King demonic beasts. There were some Peak Martial King demonic beasts which had the strength of more than 10 countries but with speed and defense much lower than 10 countries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, this beast in front of him, will all stats at 10 countries, could easily defeat other beasts that had the strength of 12 countries but with their speed or defense at the level of seven to eight countries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was saying that a demonic beast with perfect stats would definitely reach the Martial Saint level!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen stared vigilantly at the human who had abruptly become very powerful. This beast was innately cunning, it seemed to have realized something and suddenly turned to run away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Escape?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Using his Cloudmist Steps at the Obscure Realm combined with his currently formidable capabilities, Qing Shui chased the Silver Wolf Queen like a speed demon. At the same time, he took out his Crimson Dragon Bow and Bone Arrows.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Little guy, I nearly lost my life to you. How can I let you go in a good condition?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Creak!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While chasing, Qing Shui pulled his Crimson Dragon Bow to its maximum, he then imbued it with all his strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Whimper!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The strong Silver Wolf Queen was blasted away. Qing Shui was shocked to find that the Silver Wolf Queen only sustained a very light injury.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unwilling to give up, Qing Shui shot at it again. It was still only slight injured again. That small wound was nothing to the Silver Wolf Queen, but the impact was sufficient to blast it off its feet, causing it to yelp twice each time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Fine, How about the Poison Dragon Arrow?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of his Poison Dragon Arrow. His heart was filled with a sort of fervour and his face changed and he quickly took out his Poison Dragon Arrow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui targeted the shots he had planted on the butt area of the magnificent Silver Wolf Queen. Fresh blood was slowly dripping from the wound, it was just a bit of blood but that was enough.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used his Poison Dragon Arrow and locked onto one of the previous wounds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Creak!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Whimper whimper!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Maybe because it felt that this attack was going to be strong, the Silver Wolf Queen whimpered melancholily as it ran. The howl even caused Qing Shui’s hands to tremble.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a sort of objection in the howl, an attachment, a sort of helplessness. It will filled with resentment and helplessness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. A demonic beast at such a level, perhaps only with the intelligence of at least a five year old could actually produce such a complicated howl.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the midst of it, it even turned to look at Qing Shui. He could see the blue azure eyes that begged him...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui spotted the row of nipples on the Silver Wolf Queen’s abdominal area. He could tell that it was still nursing…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly became soft-hearted. Be it humans or demonic beasts, nothing could be said about whether one was above the other, but love was equal to all...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly brought down the Crimson Dragon Bow in his hands and even stopped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen stopped as well. It gave Qing Shui two low whimpers. It was different from the previous bright howl. Qing Shui could not tell what it meant. Qing Shui just waved his hands signaling to the Silver Wolf Queen to leave. Anyway, Qing Shui also planned to leave. He did not plan to stay here for long as he had decided not to covet that luscious Silver Wolf Queen’s fur. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen gave Qing Shui another two low howls.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Huh?” Qing Shui realized that the Silver Wolf Queen did not leave, it seemed to have decided to follow him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked slowly towards the wolf. As the effect of the Great Revitalizing Pellet would still last a while, Qing Shui was not afraid.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like this, Qing Shui traversed through the mountains quickly with the Silver Wolf Queen by his side. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still did not understand why the Silver Wolf Queen had decided to follow him. At least, Qing Shui was not worried for now. Even though Flowerfruit Mountain proved to be one of the most dangerous regions in the Greencloud continent, the Silver Wolf Queen amongst the demonic beasts at its grade, was within the biggest clout. It had 10,000 over ‘followers,’ and it itself was extremely powerful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As the effects of the Great Revitalizing Pellet faded, Qing Shui felt more and more cautious. Qing Shui looked at the fast sprinting Silver Wolf Queen in front of him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui even thought of running away or perhaps just killing it right now...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, Qing Shui decided to just follow silently after looking at the way that the Silver Wolf Queen seemed to treat him without putting up any defenses against him, and its previously ‘thoughtful’ barks. Qing Shui decided that in the worst case scenario, he would just enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal when the effects faded. After he was no longer in that weakened state, he would come out from the realm. At that time, he would still have two Great Revitalizing Pellets to use.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, he would eat another pellet….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With that in mind, Qing Shui felt more confident.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Silver Wolf Queen sprinted forward with its full speed. It knew that the human behind it could catch up to her speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He still had half an hour!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A river!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a fire on top of the mountain?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a forest of Fire Maples which were just like flames.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wasn’t this the location of the treasure on the second treasure map?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was totally stunned. He may not have found Goddess Peak but he was actually going to find the treasure on the second treasure map?</p>
