 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui spent the remaining days at his home. He knew he mustn’t leave because Shen Huang’s two Martial Brothers might come and look for him. Who knew what kind of people they were?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the next day, at noon, Qing Shui finally saw them. They both have appearances similar to middle-aged men. Furthermore, they seemed to be in their early mid-age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was immediately able to identify those two as Jin Feng and Huo Feng. He learned about their names from Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was able to recognize them due to the aura emitting off their body. They were very formidable. Qing Shui was unable to clearly tell the nature of their aura just as he was unable to sense Shen Huang’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, one thing that he was sure of, their strength was still inferior to Shen Huang’s. He had a feeling that he would only need to improve a little more to feel their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From here on, he could roughly tell how powerful the two were. If nothing else changed, their strength should be around four 400.000 Dao Force up to 450.000 Dao Force. Though Qing Shui’s Spiritual Sense might be powerful, the two also seemed to be very unique and actually caused him to be unable to sense their power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, Qing Shui’s strength was worth around 340.000 Dao Force. If their strength was truly around 450.000 Dao Force, such difference in strength would be considered as a huge one. Nevertheless, Qing Shui wasn’t worried too much as even their sure-kill move might not necessarily kill him. The amount of offensive prowess he could withstand was worth up to two million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This durability considered as one of Qing Shui’s most valuable assets. If he ran into warriors at the same level as himself, all he needed to do would be to go head to head against them and he would be able to defeat them effortlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two men were very good looking, they had sharp eyebrows and their profound eyes were full of charm. Their age doesn’t leave any remnants on their faces, but instead, left a whole lot of powerful charm on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two men were an inch taller than Qing Shui. Qing Shui’s height was around a hundred and eighty centimeter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you are Qing Shui?” The man who was speaking wore a golden gown. From his attire, Qing Shui could already figure out that he was Jin Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other man was wearing a dark red colored gown. Unless the two purposely switched their attire, he should be Huo Feng. He just didn’t know the purpose of their visit today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And you?” Qing Shui didn’t answer their questions but instead asked them back another question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t like people that asked for his identity as soon as they met him. Furthermore, the tone they used, was like a police interrogating a suspect. This had pissed him off and thus, he chose not to answer them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, Qing Shui’s response also made them feel a bit of discontent. Nevertheless, the man wearing a golden gown shrugged, looking like he was tidying up his cloth. Only until then, he slowly spoke, “I am Jin Feng, that’s Huo Feng, I believe you should already know about us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment of thought, Qing Shui said with a serious look, “I have never heard about you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s response made the two feel like they were being choked. Jin Feng and Huo Feng both had a great reputation around the continent. After they reached the Divine Grade, almost everyone knew who they were. They even thought that Qing Shui’s serious expression was a reaction after hearing their names.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you haven’t heard of us before, you have heard it just now. I assume that you are Qing Shui?” Huo Feng had obviously started to lose his patience and asked in an impatient tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you here for? I believe it isn’t as simple as exchanging pleasantries.” Qing Shui had indirectly told them about his identity through his response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We would like to take a look at the person who was personally invited by our Martial Sister to be a guest of the Phoenix God Organization, but now that we are here, we would like to inform you of one thing.” At this moment, Huo Feng stared at Qing Shui and said in a rather unfriendly tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, Qing Shui smiled, “Let me guess, you guys want me to leave the Phoenix God Organization and never to meet her ever again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are indeed a smart person. Talking to someone smart makes things so much easier .” Huo Feng was stunned for a while before he spoke in joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui didn’t really know what he should say. Indeed, they were smart people. Anyone who knew them well would know about their attitudes. Through the informations that Qing Shui heard about them and Shen Huang, he was easily able to figure it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is one thing I am really curious about. Exactly how many people have died because of you two try to force them to leave the organization?” Qing Shui asked out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This topic doesn’t concern you. All you need to do is to tell us whether you agree to it or not, otherwise, you are very likely to be the next one.” Huo Feng said in an unsatisfied tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Huo Feng and noticed that this person was very self-centered. It was almost at the border of God Complex. Jin Feng, on the other hand, remained silent. It was like he was letting Huo Feng did all the stupid things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now, I feel that you guys will never gain her heart even after ten eternities. Women despise guys who have low self-esteem. What kind of woman would like a man who had an inferiority complex towards other men and as a result, resorts to some stupid actions?” Qing Shui’s words were directed at Huo Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare call us stupid! Do you really not want to live anymore? Or do you seriously think that she can look after you forever?” At this moment, Jin Feng spoke up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Feng, on the other hand, started to contemplate over things only to be quickly interrupted by Jin Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Feng had a very impulsive personality. He liked solving things through his fist and he also enjoyed brute force. He was not stupid but he just didn’t like socializing. It was precisely because of his awfully simple thoughts, that he managed to achieve so much today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not up to you to decide whether I have lived long enough or not. I also don’t need anyone’s protection and I would still be able to deal with you two just fine.” Qing Shui said while maintaining a good attitude towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, it seems you are acting all mighty just because you think that you are quite strong. Seeing that you are a member of the Phoenix God Organization, are you fine if we have a sparring match against each other?” Jin Feng pointed upwards with his finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This action from him had given Qing Shui a bit of good impression on him. After all, he actually showed concern to the Qing Clan. Qing Shui then nodded, “Alright then, after you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world of warriors was a world with war. A warrior would feel regret whenever he stumbled upon a suitable opponent but didn’t spar with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them appeared high up in the sky, almost 100.000 m off the ground. The surrounding was vast and boundless. Up here, there was not even the slightest cloud visually. However, the gravity was still present. The planet of the World of the Nine Continents was too huge, similarly, its gravity should also be powerful. Despite being so high up from the ground, the gravitational force was still strong.</span></p>

It hasn’t gone to the extent where we have to kill you. In fact, we don’t even hold any grudges against each other, to begin with. Let me teach you that no matter how good you think you are, there will always be someone out there that is better than you. You are being too arrogant.” Huo Feng said in a serious tone.</span></p>

Huo Feng’s way of thinking was very unique. A woman like Shen Huang would never like him. Therefore, there was only one explanation for the rumor which said that Shen Huang was in love with him, there must be something behind it which led to that. From Qing Shui’s perspective, though Huo Feng might be very powerful, he was too simple-minded or rather, he was a bit retarded from a certain aspect.</span></p>

Back in his previous incarnation, the TV programmes used to show certain people that turned into retards from constantly cultivating. Their martial arts, however, were usually more powerful than ordinary warriors. In here, there would also be similar things. Martial arts might potentially affect a warrior’s acupoints and also their nervous system, which as a result, caused certain obstructions to appear within their bodies.</span></p>

It was likely that Shen Huang might have taken care of him because he was a mentally-ill person.</span></p>
