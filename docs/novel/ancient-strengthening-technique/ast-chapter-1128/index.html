 <p><strong>AST 1128 - Yun Duan, Qing Bei, Yuchang. There Is No Way To Achieve Perfection</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui drew a portrait of them while Qing Yu stood on a stool next to him and watched. Looking at Qing Yu, Qing Shui thought of Qing Yun. Earlier, he knew that Yun Duan and Qing Yun happened to head back for a visit previously and they should be back soon. By now, they should already be rushing back and shouldn't be far.</p>
 <p>Another person was Yuchang. This daughter of his wasn't young anymore and he heard that she had gotten quite close to a young man recently. Qing Shui had heard this from Mingyue Gelou and she had asked Qing Shui of his plans.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his daughter was old now and mature. They could decide on their own things and he would never use his daughters for things like political marriages. He felt that there was no need for this and he didn't like it either.</p>
 <p>Yuchang had also tamed a powerful demonic beast earlier. He had watched both Yuchang and Luan Luan grow up and had treated both of them like his own daughters. These two daughters also had a strong attachment to him.</p>
 <p>"Father, don't be in a daze! Get on with your drawing!" Qing Ming saw that Qing Shui went into a daze for very long and couldn't help but urged him on.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui regained his consciousness. He would go into a daze when he thought of things. Qing Shui patted Qing Ming’s head and continued drawing. Qing Shui's drawing skills had reached a very high level of mastery, to the level of drawing bones. As for the level of drawing souls and level of drawing divine essence... They were all legendary existences.</p>
 <p>Very soon, the kids appeared vividly on the paper, each of their images were very lifelike and extremely beautiful. It was as if the characters had flesh, blood, and even bones. Qing Shui's work was much better than the portrait artists outside.</p>
 <p>"Father draws so well!" Qing Yin smiled and said enviously.</p>
 <p>Qing Yan also looked at Qing Shui with great admiration. The two boys only felt that it was good but they didn't hold much interest in drawing.</p>
 <p>Looking at his daughters' envious gaze, Qing Shui recalled a saying. Every father is the hero in their children's heart. The person everyone admired the most when they were kids would be their father and they would feel that their father could accomplish anything.</p>
 <p>"Practice well, and you can become better than me." Qing Shui smiled and encouraged them.</p>
 <p>"Ah, Brother Shui is drawing? Come, draw one for your beautiful younger sister as well."</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Bei and Yuchang came in. Qing Bei had a tall and slender figure and appeared mature now. However, she hadn't lost her pure image and she still had her hair tied in a ponytail, her appearance was refreshing and filled with vigor.</p>
 <p>Yuchang, on the other hand, had a disposition similar to Mingyue Gelou's. She was poised and her bright eyes reflected intelligence. With one look, one would be able to tell that she was a clever young lady who was quiet. However, she could never be neglected.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>Yuchang greeted Qing Shui and grabbed one of his arms while pinching Qing Yu's cheek, causing her to feel displeased. Qing Yu reached out her hands to ask Qing Shui to carry her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and picked up Qing Yu, then stored the drawing he had just finished. He smiled and looked at Yuchang, "I heard that our Yuchang has someone she likes. When will you be bringing him back to let us have a look?"</p>
 <p>Yuchang looked at Qing Shui with a blush, "Father, his background is mediocre. I'm scared that you guys would not approve..."</p>
 <p>"Foolish girl. Your father had said before that I'll definitely let you guys make your own choices about your marriage. As long as you like him, I'll support you even if he is a bad guy. The prerequisite is that he treats you well. If he doesn't, I'll skin him." Qing Shui said seriously with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Father is the best! You don't disagree?" Yuchang asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>"Why would I object? If you like him, bring him back. Your father supports you. So what if he doesn't come from a good background? Our clan didn't use to be good in the past as well and even now, we're merely a parvenu, a big one." Qing Shui laughed and said.</p>
 <p>Both Yuchang and Qing Bei burst out laughing. Qing Bei laughed and said, "When we were back in Qing Village, we would never even dare to dream that a day like this would come. Back then, even reaching Xiantian was an unreachable dream."</p>
 <p>Qing Bei seemed to miss the past a little just thinking about it. She also felt that it was all a little unbelievable. In Qing Clan, Qing Bei was the most talented one aside from Qing Shui. She was the second most talented in terms of both cultivation and knowledge. In comparison, Qing You was more naive.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a unique case and could not be gauged with normal standards.</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Father. He is only a Xiantian cultivator now and had just attained a breakthrough. His talent should be considered good." Yuchang said, a little embarrassed.</p>
 <p>"Even if his talent is good, it's also thanks to our Little Yuchang. He has been beaten up many times by our Yuchang." Qing Bei laughed.</p>
 <p>"Oh? Little Bei? What is that about?" Qing Shui sounded very interested.</p>
 <p>Yuchang blushed but didn't stop Qing Bei, so she carried on. "When Yuchang went out to hunt some game for the kids, she chanced upon that guy. He had been forced into a desperate situation by an Earth Bear King and our Yuchang was kindhearted and saved him."</p>
 <p>"What happened next?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"The two of them fell in love at first sight. I met him before. He is quite handsome and righteous. Yuchang is conservative but thankfully he isn't. He is quite insistent about his love for Yuchang but he didn't pester her annoyingly. Every day, he would stand a distance from our house, waiting for our Yuchang."</p>
 <p>"Because of this, he was beaten up by the lass?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>"No. That guy wanted the rights to pursue our Yuchang, so Yuchang said that she'll give him a chance if he's able to breakthrough to Xiantian. Actually, the lass is just being conservative..."</p>
 <p>"Aunt, can you save me some face..." Yuchang said unnaturally.</p>
 <p>"Unexpectedly, either because he was lucky, or he was possessed by some god, he suddenly broke through to Xiantian within a very short period of time. Only then did the lass come out with another condition. She would marry him if he could beat her. This brought about the situation where he was beaten up." Qing Bei smiled and finished the story simply.</p>
 <p>"Little Bei, what do you think of that guy?" Qing Shui smiled and asked Qing Bei.</p>
 <p>"I think... They are both still young and can try to get along first. There's no need for them to get married so soon. I'm only afraid that their feelings are just temporary. Let them get to know more about each other and they'll know if they're suitable for each other." Qing Bei smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Yuchang, what do you think?" Qing Shui looked at Yuchang and said.</p>
 <p>"I think Aunt is right. We're still very young and have a long way ahead of us. Father has given me so many presents today, so I'll just be friends with him now. Father, don't worry, your daughter will not let Qing Clan be looked down on. I know what I should do." Yuchang smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, I'll listen to what you say. No matter what you do, your father will let your wishes be fulfilled. However, if you were to have regrets in the future, we can only try to remedy them if you were to have any regrets. But it'll be hard to say how far we can remedy the situation." When Qing Shui said this, he was very serious.</p>
 <p>"Father, I understand."</p>
 <p>By now, the others had also started to come in, each of them holding dishes. Earlier, the ladies and Qing Shui's aunts had all gone to cook. Now that they were done, they could have their meal.</p>
 <p>The kids put away their stuff and Qing Shui brought Qing Yu to change her clothes. Everyone went about with their preparations and the meal would be started soon.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>In the late afternoon, Qing Shui sensed something. He went out to see a flying beast which was afar. His vision was very good and although it was very far, he could see that it was Yun Duan. He flew up, as if he was a roc spreading its wings.</p>
 <p>When the beautiful lady saw Qing Shui, she pounced towards Qing Shui while carrying their daughter. Qing Shui took his daughter from her hands with one hand while embracing Yun Duan with the other. As he looked at the satisfied woman who was leaning in his arms and the daughter that she had given him, Qing Shui also felt very satisfied.</p>
 <p>However, thinking of how he would be leaving very soon and they would only be able to meet after a very long time, he felt a little depressed. Qing Shui hoped that he could get stronger after he headed to the other Four Continents. If he did, he would be able to look for other avenues to bring his family here over.</p>
 <p>"Duan`er, I've missed you and our daughter." Qing Shui kissed her and the lass.</p>
 <p>The lass could now say simple words and talk. She looked especially beautiful with her tender and beautiful appearance together with her luxurious looking clothes.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had gotten closer with the lass after the previous time. Although they hadn't met for very long, it seemed like she could still remember him and was even very happy to see Qing Shui. Yun Duan could not help but smile even brighter.</p>
 <p>The demonic beast flew very slowly and Qing Shui let go of Yun Duan, taking out the presents he had prepared for the lass. Qing Shui felt like he had been negligent toward these children but he felt helpless at the same time. Thankfully, all of them had very strong mothers.</p>
 <p>They arrived back at Qing Clan very soon and it was already the afternoon. They gathered together and it was very lively. Qing Yi took the lass while Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps and brought Yun Duan to a quiet place. He let her take the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl and then let her use the low grade Sacred Beast Pill to tame a powerful demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Earlier, when Qing Shui told her about the effects of the low grade Sacred Beast Pill, Yun Duan had told him to save it for the people in Qing Clan, who would need it more. After Qing Shui told her that the others already had theirs, she didn't continue to reject his offer.</p>
 <p>"Duan`er, the lass is already so old but I haven't seen her much. I'll try to think of a way for everyone to be together." Although Qing Shui was a little insincere when he said this, he would really look for a way. He didn't believe that there were only one or two ways to get to the other Four Continents. If there was really no other way out, then he would hope that he could level up his Nine Continents Steps. He would then be able to try to pass through from the Southern Sea, Giant Beasts Mountains, Sky Penetrating Mountains, or the Arctic Plains.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, its fine. I'm happy to be able to see my daughter. She's a daughter you've given to me and I'm very satisfied. I know that you have things to do. I'll stay here and wait for you. I'll be happy even if I have to wait until the day I die." Yun Duan seemed to say this very casually but Qing Shui knew that these were her heartfelt words.</p>
 <p>"It won't take long. We still have a very long way ahead of us. Trust me." Qing Shui felt that after he had gotten stronger, there would definitely be a way for him to pass between the Five Continents and the other Four Continents.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I trust you. Qing Shui, I like all these things which you've given me!" Yun Duan said happily.</p>
 <p>"Later, I'll give you some things to give to your younger brother as well. In the future, let him be the one to take over Cloud Adventurer Guild!" Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Then I'll thank him on your behalf." After seeing Qing Shui's expression, Yun Duan smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"You're still standing on ceremony. See how I'll teach you a lesson tonight."</p>
 <p>Yun Duan blushed and threw Qing Shui a slight look of annoyance. That charming gaze caused Qing Shui to grab her by the waist and kiss her red lips. His hands greedily moved around her body. He was quickly unsatisfied by the touch separated by clothes and plunged into the peaks directly under her clothes.</p>
 <p>Their location was filled with lush greenery and it wasn't as cold as the Northern Sacred Lu Continent. The summer was about to start but the temperature wasn't very high. They were in a small block of mountain and after extending out his spiritual sense, Qing Shui gradually removed Yun Duan's clothes on these lush plains.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, don't do it here." Yun Duan said quickly.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, no one will come. Duan`er, don't you want me?" Qing Shui put his hands around her slender waist from behind and planted a kiss on her pretty back.</p>
