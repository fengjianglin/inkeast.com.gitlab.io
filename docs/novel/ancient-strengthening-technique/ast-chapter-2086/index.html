 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his arm to circulate the Nine Yang Force. With the Nine Yang Force, the strong Origin Qi erased the remaining droplet of Demon King blood. Qing Shui then said, “Okay. No one should find it now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve agreed that I’ll give it to you after I’ve used it for a period of time,” Sheng Huang said as she stowed away the Frigid Jade Stone Bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm, sure. Actually, there will be something better in the future. At that time, it’s also fine if you’re willing to give it to me. You don’t have to be like this. Do we have to act this distant?” Qing Shui looked at Shen Huang in confusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang’s expression was a little unnatural. Looking at Qing Shui, she wasn’t sure what to say neither. She was a reserved woman and taking the initiative to kiss Qing Shui previously had been because she felt that she was about to reach the end of her life. Perhaps in her heart, she just wanted to have her own way for once. It was a kiss, and it could only be this man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she sought out Qing Shui, she had planned to celebrate her last New Year’s with him. However, no one could have expected that she might not even be able to wait until the last New Year’s. She didn’t expect that this man’s physique would complete hers, and extend her lifespan slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also because of this man that she had sought after the slimmest chance of survival. Hard work wouldn’t be a letdown. He had quite a few magical objects and combat skills. She didn’t even have time to head to the Blazing Fire Land. Apart from this man who could rush to the Blazing Fire Land in an instant, she didn’t know who else could do the job.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not too bad after that. Though there were dangers, they managed to get through all of them safely. They didn’t manage to find the Blaze Moth, but the Peach of Immortality instead. On top of that, the man’s medical skills could actually remove the Black Ice Poison completely. She owed him yet another life debt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve said before that you’re the person closest to me. Even if you kill me one day, I will still feel that way,” Shen Huang confessed once again with a smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t talk nonsense. How could I kill you?” Qing Shui shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Some things are hard to say. I can’t say that one day we won’t be on opposite sides. What would you do then?” Shen Huang said. She appeared to like the idea of the scenario she had presented.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his head and said, “I don’t have any lofty aspirations. I don’t wish to be some kind of saint, and I don’t want to be reckless in the name of justice. Even if my woman is a Devil Chief, I will stand by her side.” He said frankly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, really?” Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui, smiling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really. I don’t care about what others think, though I will try to think of ways to cure her. I’m a miracle doctor after all,” Qing Shui said and snickered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be more careful during this period of time. I’m going to seclude myself.” Shen Huang decided on her next move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. However, thinking about the benefits she had gained lately, even more so now with the Frigid Jade Stone Bed, seclusion was the best option. The next time she came out, she would be even more dazzling and resplendent. Shen Huang could really spread her wings and take flight in the Nine Heavens, becoming a true Phoenix.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t forget about me when you go into seclusion. When the time comes and you don’t remember who I am, I will come crying to you,” Qing Shui said seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if I forget who I am, I will remember you and remember how you treated me so well previously,” Shen Huang said gently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were words of intimacy, true words of intimacy. For people who usually didn’t say such things, those were the most moving words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are for you. They will help you. The method to use them is inside.” Qing Shui gave her some precious Medicinal Pills that she would use in seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm,” Shen Huang responded softly as she received the items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going then!” Qing Shui said gently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the calm, but slightly downcast Shen Huang, Qing Shui smiled and turned around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that soft voice, Qing Shui’s body trembled. He turned around, and felt a delicate body hug him. Qing Shui held onto her tightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop. I can’t lose my virginity. The techniques I train in won’t allow it,” Shen Huang gripped onto Qing Shui’s hand, that was drifting onto her back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t lose it ever?” Qing Shui asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. I just know that I can’t now,” Shen Huang said, blushing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hugged her. Her words proved that her relationship with Qing Shui was extremely intimate, and actually even confirming their relationship. It was a shame that she couldn’t do it, and Qing Shui didn’t dare touch her. However, he said into her ear, “Do you want me to make you happy, just once like last time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang’s slender body trembled. Eventually, Qing Shui’s Soul Charming Bone Weakening had made Shen Huang giddy. Although Qing Shui wasn’t satisfied, seeing his woman in such a state had filled him with joy and his heart was also fulfilled. This kind of satisfaction was completely different from physical satisfaction. Something like this had happened in his previous life. If the lady could not be satisfied, even if the man was, he would feel disappointed and useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang could feel that hard thing at the lower part of her body, and had even grabbed it before. She was blushing, but her face carried the elation of being satisfied, and radiated a fatal charm. Although they hadn’t actually made love, Qing Shui couldn’t help but imagine how enchanting it would be if he really did it with her one day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re letting your imagination run off again…” Shen Huang said, not daring to lift her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui mumbled something secretly into her ear, causing her to shiver and quietly moan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui waited for Shen Huang to change her clothes, before sending her to Phoenix Mountain and leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He directly used the Nine Continents Steps to return to the Azure Rainbow City’s Imperial Cuisine Hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he only left for little more than a day, a lot had happened. He had killed four people from the Demon Gate, as the Demon King Palace probably belonged to the Demon Gate, though Qing Shui wasn’t clear if it was true or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was stronger, he could possibly come across the real Demon Gate and the Divine Palace, or even enter the Palace itself. Maybe there wasn’t a Divine Palace or Demon Gate but just loose alliances. He gave up pondering this after a while. Strength was the most important. No matter the situation, one’s own strength reigned supreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the Golden Battle God, the leader of the Battle Gods. He just couldn’t confirm if he was the only one. If there were multiple Golden Battle God descendants, it would depend on whose abilities were stronger. Qing Shui could instantly dispatch people as strong as he was, so all he had to do was to improve his strength. After all, though he could defend, his attacking strength was pathetic. Compared to Shen Huang’s level, the difference was far too great. Even if he had used the Nine Continents Mountain, he still couldn’t bridge the gap.</span></p>

He was very hardworking, though it was a pity that he was different from Qing Shui. His strength was not up to par, hence his medical skills were largely restricted. However, Qing Shui had taught him several simplified acupuncture techniques that didn’t require great power to carry out, though the result wasn’t as great. Even so, it was still useful.&nbsp;</span></p>

He wanted to wait to find a Demonic Beast Origin Medicinal Pill on the scale of a Martial King to increase Big Tiger’s abilities by a large amount. That way, his medical skills would improve a lot.&nbsp;</span></p>

Real curing methods needed acupuncture. Big Tiger had insufficient strength to use acupuncture. Therefore, Qing Shui could only teach him to do it on a smaller scale, and in multiple rounds. This naturally reduced the effects of the treatment. However, there was no other way around it.</span></p>
