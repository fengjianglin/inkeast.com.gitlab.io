 <p><strong>AST 1530 - A Voluntary Action</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui had his lunch at the old man’s home. The people from Qin King Manor were all here. The clan consisted of a lot of experts, children and more. Basically, people of all ages. Qing Shui didn’t expect things to be so grand.</p>
 <p>However, getting the old man’s lifespan extended was still quite a big issue. Thus, it was normal for them to hold such a grand dinner. The only question was whether the news had spread or not. Everyone was happy to find out Qing Shui came with Qin Qing. They were all really friendly to him as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if everyone from Qin King Manor was present or not. There were about thirty of them who came so the atmosphere was still quite boisterous. The old man was really happy. Somehow, Qing Shui could feel that there were people who realized that the old man’s life had been extended.</p>
 <p>A lot of people knew that Qing Shui came to Qin King Manor this time in order to treat the old man. They knew now that the old man had been cured, but it was unknown how many people were aware that the problem with the old man was that he was reaching the end of his life.</p>
 <p>Qin King Manor shared a decent relationship with the royal family. There might not be many family members in Qin King Manor, but they had a lot of experts in it. Qin Baifo might seem really humble, but his strength was so formidable that even Qing Shui was unable to sense it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Chuan, Qin Qing, and also a few of the old men who came after, were not people to be provoked. The fact that Qin King Manor was capable of conquering the entire Qin Royal City already meant that it wasn’t that easy to be toppled over.</p>
 <p>There were not many direct descendants in Qin King Manor, but a lot of people had attached themselves to Qin King Manor itself. The main thing about Qin King Manor was that it was very proficient at accumulating people around it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A lot of people toasted with Qing Shui on the dining table. Qin Qing was sitting beside Qing Shui. A lot of people found the both of them really suitable for each other the more they looked at them. From time to time, they would also say something to tease them. They seemed to be a really carefree family.</p>
 <p>This was one of the most harmonious clans that Qing Shui had seen. They were also the aristocratic clan with the fewest number of members. Of course, it was still a clan with deep and unmeasurable power.</p>
 <p>After having their dinner, the people from Qin Royalty bid their farewells one by one. After greeting Qing Shui, Qin Baifo and Qin Qing stayed behind. There were also three other elderly men with white hair present.</p>
 <p>The three old men only came a bit later. They were the old man’s son and Qin Baifo’s brother. They had also created branch families of their own and were existences which mustn’t be underestimated in Qin King City. It was just that they still paled in comparison to Qin Baifo’s branch.</p>
 <p>Qin Baifo was a formidable existence. It could be said that even if the old man was gone, Qin King Manor would still be fine. Qin King Manor didn’t inherit their position based on their eldest son. They inherited their position to the most capable child in the clan.</p>
 <p>Qin Baifo was a humble person, so much so that he could be described as languid for not doing anything. Despite that, the old man still lets him inherit everything from Qin King Manor. When it came to inheritance, Qin King Manor was very strict with it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As for the bloodlines with the royalty, if it wasn’t because Qin King Manor was strong, they would have long cut off their ties with each other with such an insignificant bloodline. It was precisely because of their strength that they managed to retain their position as a royal member.</p>
 <p>Seeing that he was the only outsider, Qing Shui stood up and said, “I am going out to walk around.”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, there is no need for that. I am already a man who is near the end of his life. You are not an outsider.” The old man smiled and said as he hinted Qing Shui to sit down.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Qing remained silent. She only looked back, glanced at Qing Shui and gave him a smile.&nbsp;Qing Shui wasn’t really sure how he felt from seeing her smile.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Qing`er, it seems you have taken a huge leap in your strength. Furthermore, I can also feel a powerful aura which doesn’t belong to our clan. Did you happen to have run into an unusual encounter?” The old man noticed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I received the Phoenix Battle God’s Inheritance. Qing Shui was the one who bestowed me with the opportunity.” Qin Qing said without the slightest intention to hide it.</p>
 <p>This has caused a ruckus among the people who were present around the room. To think that such a good thing would happen to Qin King Manor. Since Qin Qing received the Phoenix Battle God Inheritance, so long as she wished, Qin King Manor could finally be like the descendants of the Battle God in the future.</p>
 <p>Except, Qin Qing was a girl. And a girl was meant to get married to a guy. The old man, however, with his bright eyes, was able to tell that Qing Shui was no ordinary person. There must be a reason behind how Qing Shui was able to let Qin Qing receive the Phoenix Battle God Inheritance. For example, he might already have the Battle God Inheritance or something even more powerful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Qing receiving the Phoenix Battle God’s Inheritance was an unexpected surprise. A huge, unexpected surprise. Now, Qin King Manor’s position has become even more stable just like a mountain.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, take this opportunity to bring Qing Shui out and have a look around the street.” Qin Baifo said happily. Even though everyone was sitting together, they didn’t really talk about anything important.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It’s not that they didn’t trust Qing Shui. Qing Shui was, after all, a guest. It’s not necessary for them to drag Qing Shui into problems of their own upon the first time meeting him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui and Qin Qing had made their way to the street, it was already early nighttime. The two of them walked shoulder to shoulder with none of them attempting to start a conversation with each other.</p>
 <p>“You have a really happy family.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“I also feel the same way.” Qin Qing replied warmly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Well then, would you mind letting me know how it feels to be in your family?” Qing Shui was very straightforward with his words. Naturally, Qin Qing was also able to interpret what he meant. This was what Qing Shui would always do, trying to take advantages as soon as he saw an opportunity.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No! This is my family!” Qin Qing retorted with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Do we really need to divide our line so clearly?” The surprised Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it is absolutely necessary.” Qin Qing felt an urge to punch him when she saw his overly dramatic expression. She knew that he was doing it on purpose. He was just trying to tease her.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, every family goes through problems of their own. There are things which may look really good from the surface, but down the stage, it's filled with sorrow.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned upon hearing Qin Qing’s confusing words.</p>
 <p>But he knew what she meant by her words. He asked in an uncertain tone, “Does Qin Royalty have problems of their own as well?”</p>
 <p>“This world is the same as a tower. No matter where you stand, you are bound to face problems of your own. Actually, this tower is an endless tower. There will always be people who will be higher, stronger than you. Just as how the tower interpreted it.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood the meaning of her answer. He thought a bit about it and said, “No matter what happens, I will face it with you.”</p>
 <p>Qin Qing shook her head, “I don’t want you to do that.”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Qing Shui’s eyes were firmly locked onto the attractive, simple, elegant and kind-hearted woman who was as beautiful as a fairy. As of now, Qing Shui felt that he was neither distant nor that close to her. Though they might be close to each other, Qing Shui somehow felt like he hadn’t really had any actual interactions with her.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to owe you too much. This way, I fear that the final result will be that I have to give myself to you.” Qin Qing smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized that even if he was able to converse with her about a lot of things, he was still unable to interpret the true meanings of her words. While what he said may sound really flirtatious, it somehow also felt like she was rejecting herself. He didn’t know what she was trying to say with her words.</p>
 <p>“When a person decides to give someone their all, they won’t ask for anything in return. The person would be delighted to do anything for them. Do you understand what I mean?” Qing Shui looked far into the distance with a serious expression. His eyes looked really clear yet also really deep.</p>
 <p>Qin Qing was stunned. Was he willing to do anything for her?</p>
 <p>“We haven’t really known each other for a long time, but I mentioned to you before that it feels like the opposite like I have known you for more than a lifetime. That’s the reason why I found you extremely familiar when I first met you. It’s because, from my memory, it felt like remembering that you were my wife.” Qing Shui didn’t know if he was babbling nonsense. But he was really serious when he was saying it.</p>
 <p>Qin Qing didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>“I am not trying to make you believe me. I just wanted to tell you that I do all of this because I want to. You don’t have to feel burdened by me. It’s just like how you are willing to do anything for your family without asking for anything in return. I am doing the same thing for you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you trying to make me feel touched?” Qin Qing asked in a gentle tone. However, she was really feeling a bit touched.</p>
 <p>“One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions. Of course, there will always be exceptions for this kind of situations. Xiao Qing`er, can we please try to be more pure and clean?”</p>
 <p>“Just go die already! You are the one who isn’t being pure and clean. Don’t you dare say that about me.” Qin Qing smiled.</p>
 <p>“Miss Qin!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, an attractive voice came through. Four men were heading towards where Qing Shui and Qin Qing were. They all looked considerably young. The man taking the lead was wearing a snow white brocade cloth. He had a tall and straight figure with a handsome face. A smile filled with confidence could be seen hanging across his face.</p>
 <p>The person who shouted Miss Qin just now was precisely this man, but Qing Shui was a bit annoyed with him because he thought that the man was somewhat fake.</p>
 <p>Qin Qing stopped and eyed the four people heading towards her, “Is there anything which Prince Gu would like from me?”</p>
 <p>“What a coincidence. Miss Qin, when did you come back? Please allow me to treat you to a drink.” Since the beginning, the man didn’t bother to even bat an eye at Qing Shui. His eyes have never left Qin Qing. This made Qing Shui a bit grumpy.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, but I have an appointment with my friend.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, may I know who this is? Why don’t we go together?” The man didn’t plan to back off.</p>
 <p>“My friend, Qing Shui. Qing Shui, this is Prince Gu.” Qin Qing’s way of introducing him was almost the same as not introducing him.</p>
 <p>“Nice to meet you. Why don’t we go together?” Prince Gu said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“It’s better if we do it next time. Right now, I would like to have some alone time with Qing`er.” Qing Shui rejected his request.</p>
 <p>Qin Qing was stunned, but she didn’t express anything. Prince Gu on the other hand, for a moment, frowned. He was a bit mad with what Qing Shui said. But similarly, he also didn’t really express how he felt. Instead, he smiled and said, “Alright then, we will do it next time.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected for the person to back off so easily. It might have been that he was trying to give face to Qin Qing. Following that, the two proceeded to enter the inn. At a spot near the window on the highest floor of the hotel, waves after waves of people could be seen walking back and forth on the street.</p>
 <p>“Qing`er, it seems that there are a lot of people going after you.” Qing Shui said while ordering some tasty drinks.</p>
 <p>“Gu Yelong is from the Gu Clan, and the Gu Clan is a formidable existence in Great Qin Dynasty.”</p>
 <p>“How is Qin King Manor compared to the Gu Clan?”</p>
 <p>“There are very few people in QinKing Manor. Frankly speaking, we wouldn’t be a match for them.”</p>
 <p>“Is Qin King Manor on good terms with the Gu Clan?” Qing Shui looked at Qin Qing seriously.</p>
 <p>“No! It’s very, very bad.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Qing Shui looked at Qin Qing with a confused look.</p>
 <p>“Gu Yelong had once sent people to Qin King Manor to propose a marriage. But I didn’t agree to it. As you know, aristocratic clans care a lot about their pride. Naturally, this led to a deterioration of our relationship. If they ever get a chance to humiliate Qin King Manor, I am sure they won’t let go of that golden opportunity.” Qin Qing said in an upset tone.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, such a thing will not happen. The old man has still got a long life to live. And uncle, his strength can only be described by the word formidable.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qin Qing showed Qing Shui a strange expression, “My father is a humble man. There are people who say that he is strong and there are also those who say that he is weak. Those who assume him to be strong only say that because my father lives among Qin Royalty.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“There may not be a lot of people from Qin King Manor, but each and every one of them is a warrior with great talents. So is Qing`er.”</p>
 <p>By now, Qin Qing was already used to Qing Shui calling her Qing`er. She used to argue with him when he first started calling her that. But every time she tried to argue with Qing Shui, Qing Shui would only make matters worse by calling her Xiao Qing`er or Xiao Qing Qing. Thus, she stopped arguing with him and let him did as he pleased in fear that if she did, he would say something even cheesier.</p>
