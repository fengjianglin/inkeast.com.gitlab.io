 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed by very quickly and in the blink of an eye, three years had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three years weren’t considered either long nor short. During this period of time, Qing Shui had gone back for a few times, a maximum of twice per year. During these three years, Qing Shui had spent his time in the Linhai City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he was most worried about the Sunset Palace and the Demon Lord Palace. Right now, the Demon Lord Palace had already been moved to a place that wasn't too far from the Ice Ocean Domain. This area was covered in snow and Tantai Lingyan liked a place like this. Therefore, the final location was decided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">About half of the people from the Demon Lord Palace had moved to here. Hua Rumei and Zhan Yu had, of course, moved over. They had been with Qing Shui for a very long time, and there was also Jin Ci and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhan Yu, Hua Rumei, and Jin Ci were all very powerful. Especially Hua Rumei, who was also a Peak False God. Even under Qing Shui's help, it was still very difficult to attain a breakthrough to the Divine Grade. It would take some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this period of time, Qing Shui had made it so that Tantai Lingyan, Qin Qing, and Yiye Jiange could meet each other. Although they were separated on being on land and being in the ocean, it didn't affect them from being able to take care of each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the three years, Qing Shui's strength hadn’t increased by much. He spent his time stabilizing his powers and tempering his physical body. It was the same for the ladies as well. Although they were very powerful, now that the three ladies and Tantai Lingyan were all Divinities, they would need to spend a very long time stabilizing their powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing continued to be a Peak False God. The same goes for Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong. It wasn't enough to just indiscriminately get stronger. One must make an overall plan for the long term. Right now, they were all powerful experts and they had such foresight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the three years, the Hellfire Phoenix and the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider still remained as Qing Shui's only Divine Grade demonic beasts. The other demonic beasts didn't attain further breakthrough and even the two Divine Grade demonic beasts didn't get any more tremendously powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, three years were really considered to be too short. In certain areas, 30 years, or even 300 years, might seem to be a brief moment. A cultivator's or a demonic beast's strength remaining the same for three years, 30 years, or even 300 years was perfectly normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the day when Qing Shui had prepared to leave. Tantai Lingyan was also leaving with him. Qin Qing chose to stay at the Demon Lord Palace as she managed the Demon Lord Palace together with Hua Rumei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because they had just received a request for help from the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. The Divine Moon Immortal Sect had wiped out the Blade Demon Immortal Sect but hadn't expected that the latter still had an influence backing them up. The Divine Moon Immortal Sect hadn't been able to fend off the attacks. Yin Tian and Feng Xi thought of Qing Shui's extraordinary abilities and believed that he was much stronger than them. This was why they had no choice but to seek help from Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, Yin Tian and his wife were still quite nice. In the beginning, they had taken in Tantai Lingyan as their daughter in order to thank Qing Shui. After all, Qing Shui was still a far cry from them back then. Although they knew that Qing Shui might surpass them in the future, it was just a thought and nothing more than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also because of this that Qing Shui treated the Divine Moon Immortal Sect as a very intimate friend. Tantai Lingyan couldn't wait either and they decided to head over immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a feeling that this time around, he would definitely step into a highly competitive circle and it would be very hard for him to get out of it. Even so, he wasn't afraid. It was only through competition that there would be opportunities, and thus, breakthroughs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing had also gotten familiar with Yiye Jiange and the other ladies. On land, this place was very safe. Lan Lingfeng and Yiye Jiange were not on the same level as before and became top-notch experts in the False God level. Moreover, Qin Qing was strong enough. If they were to encounter any unexpected effects, they could also look for Yiye Jiange and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan could leave with a peace of mind. Qin Qing's Giant Azure Dragon was already one step into being a Divinity and would attain a breakthrough at any moment. Qing Shui felt that the Giant Azure Dragon would definitely attain a faster breakthrough than Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Continents Steps!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, Qing Shui called out the Hellfire Phoenix, which was also the Dark Phoenix. It could undergo Form Transformation. However, it could only develop his abilities to his fullest while in his beast form. For example, his flying abilities. If he wasn't in his beast form, his speed would be reduced drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After demonic beasts undergo Form Transformation, their thoughts would still be different from that of a human's. Despite so, their thoughts were already extremely similar to a human’s way of thinking. This was the kind of existence that the demonic tribes were. They were tribes that comprised of demonic beasts that had undergone Form Transformation, taken on the human form, and then developed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were much more outstanding than humans in many areas. After all, it was like how if a powerful wild beast in Qing Shui's previous life were to gain a human's intelligence, they would become terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as they evolved, the descendants that they produced were mostly unable to take on the beast form. They could only regain their beast form after cultivating to a certain degree. Only then would they able to battle in their beast form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the two extremes. Demonic beasts that had undergone Form Transformation were not amazing just because they could take on the human form. But rather, being able to undergo Form Transformation meant that they possessed extraordinary intelligence. However, they would still need to maintain their beast form in order to unleash their true powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hellfire Phoenix spread out its wings covering up the sky. Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan appeared too small on it. Qing Shui didn't feel uncomfortable simply because the Hellfire Phoenix had undergone the Form Transformation. This was the relationship between a Beast Tamer and their demonic beasts. It wouldn't change just because of such a minor difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of the Hellfire Phoenix had reached an unbelievable degree. A series of after images were left behind in the air, just like shooting stars chasing after a moon. That feeling of extreme speed was very exhilarating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now felt that with this speed, he should be able to move through the world of the nine continents. He thought of the old turtle and how it had Heavenly Technique that could be used in the water. This was also why, back then, Tantai Lingyan was able to move through the few continents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Linhai City wasn't considered near to the martial territories. However, with the speed of the current Hellfire Phoenix, he would only need three days. Earlier, he would need to take over a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need to worry. The Divine Moon Immortal Sect won't be taken over so easily." Qing Shui could tell that Tantai Lingyan was very worried and tried to calm her down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If Godmother and the others could handle it, they wouldn't look for us. Since she has requested for help, it means that things are very bad." Tantai Lingyan shook her head and said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Qing Shui not know this? He was only trying to console Tantai Lingyan. However, intelligent women would still remain calm at times like this. It wasn't that easy for them to be startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of the Hellfire Phoenix once again increased abruptly. He could understand their conversation and knew that they were very anxious. Therefore, he increased his speed to the greatest degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In about slightly over two days, Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan arrived at the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. When they did, they knew that things were really urgent. It was because both Yin Tian and Old Wang were seriously injured. However, the other party didn't seem to be in a hurry to wipe them out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of the Hellfire Phoenix was terrifying and he cut through straight into the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. Right now, Qing Shui wasn't sure if the enemies weren't in a hurry to wipe them out or if the Divine Moon Immortal Sect had some kind of unknown power protecting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Qing Shui's and Tantai Lingyan's appearance, Feng Xi was very happy. However, there was still a sign of great worry reflecting on her face. She even missed out on Tantai Lingyan's current abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lass Yan. Qing Shui, why have you brought Lass Yan here as well?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Godmother, how are you?" When Tantai Lingyan saw this situation, she was still a little relieved. Even if there were people who were seriously injured, she could trust Qing Shui's medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm fine. The other side wished to slowly bring us to our deaths. Otherwise, we'd have been dead long ago." Feng Xi shook her head and smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui. Uncle has no other way out either. You won't blame me for seeking help from you, right?" Although Yin Tian was injured, he could still move like an ordinary person. However, both he and Old Wang weren't that much stronger than an ordinary person. Right now, the only ones who could still put up a fight were Yin Sha and Feng Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that the other party wanted them to feel desperation, to let them slowly feel helpless. Qing Shui still had no idea who the other party was, nor their relationship with the Blade Demon Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aunt Feng, who is the other party?" Qing Shui checked on Yin Tian's and Old Wang's injuries as he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"They are from the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect" Feng Xi sighed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just from their names, Qing Shui thought that the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect and the Blade Demon Immortal Sect should have a very close relationship. The fact that the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect had stood up for the Blade Demon Immortal Sect had already proven this. The reason that Qing Shui had guessed as such was also due to the name of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't ask further. At that moment, Feng Xi said, "The Blade Demon Immortal Sect is considered to be a branch of the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect. It's said that they have the same blood flowing in them as the sect master of the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How strong are they? Aunt Feng, are you aware?" This was what Qing Shui was concerned the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The ones who had come out are slightly stronger than me and your uncle. Although they weren't out to kill, the two of them were still seriously injured." When Feng Xi said this, there was a little helplessness and bitterness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because there were still other people who had not stepped forth yet. Although Qing Shui was quite strong and had the amazing ability to weaken his opponents, the other party's Immortal Sect was more than just a little stronger than the Divine Moon Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aunt Feng, there's no need to worry. Lingyan and I are here now. It'll be fine. Although Uncle's and Uncle Wang's injuries are a little serious, they would be able to recover. It's just that they won't be able to do anything in the short term." Qing Shui said calmly. However, he wasn't really as calm as he had appeared to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was still unclear about the Divine Grade. A strength of over 100 Dao force would be the Grade 1 Divine. He wasn't sure if one had a strength of over 3,000 Dao force, would the person still be considered a Grade 1 Divine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Godmother, don't worry. It'll be fine." Tantai Lingyan also spoke out softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmmm? Lass Yan has also attained a breakthrough?" Feng Xi looked at Tantai Lingyan, astonished. She hadn't realized it earlier due to the current situation, and thus had only just recently found out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi wasn't the only one who hadn't realized it. Even Yin Sha hadn't realized it either. Both Old Wang and Yin Tian didn't have the abilities to detect it right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the current state of the Divine Moon Immortal Sect, feeling a little dejected. Despite it being such a great Immortal Sect, they didn't have many Divinities. Earlier, the Hong Clan had over ten of them, and there were some others as well. However, the Hong Clan was no more but the Qingfeng and Mingyue Clans were back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had come back when the Divine Moon Immortal Sect was at its most critical state. Earlier, they had left because they had done the Yin Clan wrong. However, they had returned when the Divine Moon Immortal Sect was about to perish. Not everyone would have the courage to do the same.</span></p>
