 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since they had decided to play games with him, he might as well make it big. Qing Shui smiled and said something to Yu Dinghe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dinghe didn’t know how strong exactly Qing Shui was. However, when he saw Yu Dingshan treated him like a God and when he beat up Qiao Lao, he knew that Qing Shui was not an ordinary person. Anyone would be able to tell that this young man possessed formidable strength, or to be more precise, the way he dealt with his enemies was very frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood up and slowly walked towards the middle-aged man, “I don’t care who you are. I am starting my business here and while I am doing so, I don’t appreciate it when someone tries to cause troubles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, this is the funniest thing which I have heard in so many years! This truly cracks me up!” The middle-aged man got so angry that he started laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third Young Master Liu had already embarrassed himself before. With so many people watching, if the Liu Clan was to be suppressed by merely a young man, the Liu Clan would definitely lose their face completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to make the Azure Rainbow City his foundation. He hoped that in the future, he could slowly develop himself in the entire Northern Blue Domain. Azure Rainbow City wasn’t scary. Be it the Yu Clan or Liu Clan, even if both of the clans were to work together, Qing Shui also wouldn’t fear them. They were simply not strong enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a rough knowledge of the Northern Blue Domain. Out of the entire domain, the Azure Rainbow City was considered to be one of the weakest cities. This was also what led Qing Shui to make up his mind to settle down at the Azure Rainbow City. He wouldn’t need to rush his steps and thus, he could ensure that he built a stable foundation here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You will stop finding it funny in a while. Even though Azure Rainbow City might not be the weakest city in Northern Blue Domain, it was already ranked at almost the bottom. Even if Liu Clan is the strongest existence in the Azure Rainbow City, there are still plenty above you that can stomp you to death. Let alone the Azure Rainbow City isn’t made up by your clan alone. What do you have to show off about? Sometimes, there may be no more second chance even if you regret what you do. By then, you may not even know how you die.” Qing Shui looked at the middle-aged man and said while retaining his calm tone from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression of the middle-aged man changed. Even though he didn’t grow up being scared of others, he was still frozen in shock with what he saw. There were things which one would better believe rather than ignoring it. Liu Clan had been going on smoothly for too long. There was a saying “If a person has been in prosperity for too long, there will come a time when their luck will run out”. After walking their path so smoothly for so long, they would eventually stumble upon a few misfortunes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can treat it as me trying to scare you. Be it an aristocratic clan, you should still have your own principles. If a person always walks at night, there would come a time when he would run into a ghost. If a person’s mind is in the right place, their qi will follow along and become smooth. Once a person has smooth qi, he will be able to remain alive for a long time. The third young master of the Liu Clan is a garbage, if the entire Liu Clan runs into a serious accident, all because of a garbage like him, I can’t help but wonder if you guys will regret it by then.” Qing Shui turned around by the time he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a moment, the middle-aged man was in a difficult situation and unable to decide what to do. He had a very strange feeling that this brat might be able to kill him to the point he could never resurrect back from the dead. It felt too real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third uncle, don’t get scared by him. What is he? Kill him! I want him dead!” At this moment, Third Young Master Liu screamed out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Say it one more time if you dare. I will immediately turn you into a dead man.” Qing Shui glared at the Third Young Master Liu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Third Young Master Liu’s and Qing Shui’s eyes met, he immediately trembled. However, when he realized that people in the surroundings all had eyes set on him, his arrogance came back. He was the third young master of Liu Clan. He had never once feared anyone in the Azure Rainbow City. “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if an immature brat like him will dare to defy the Liu Clan!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” He thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want you dead! You must die! You little bastard! You dare punch me? Yu Xixuan, you bitch! I will capture you alive today and play you to death!” Third Young Master Liu screamed out in a fierce tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had embarrassed himself greatly before. To begin with, he was already a proud and egotistical person. As if the incident which involved him and the Yu Clan hadn’t embarrassed him enough, he even got beaten up like a dead dog earlier. This caused him to start shifting all his hatreds onto Qing Shui and Yu Xixuan. This was because Qing Shui was brought here by Yu Xixuan personally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui only flicked his finger and a chopstick on the table shot right away towards Young Master Liu and stabbed past his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third Young Master Liu put his hands around his own throat while opening his mouth and making the noise “wu-wu…”. Very soon, he collapsed onto the ground and died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surroundings were dead silent to the point even the noise of a needle dropping onto the ground could be heard. A person of the Liu Clan was killed! Even if the person who died was a garbage and a lot of people had intended to kill him, he was still a person of the Liu Clan. Moreover, he was not an ordinary Liu Clan member, but the third son of the Clan’s Head. Across the Azure Rainbow City, Liu Clan could already be considered as one of the top existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man, who was also the third uncle of the Third Young Master Liu looked at Qing Shui furiously and said, “Do you really think that the Liu Clan will allow you to do as you please?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will let anyone who attempts to kill me die first. I have already held back before because I didn’t want to hurt the innocents. If you still insist on fighting against me even after that, I will gladly accept your challenge.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we don’t find a solution for the things which happened today, Liu Clan will no longer be able to stand firm in the Azure Rainbow City. Please allow me to fight with you for the justice of my clan.” The man with surname Liu said to Qing Shui with a serious voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are not strong enough to be my opponent. Even though you possess decent strength, I think it will be best if you don’t do anything against me. Otherwise, you will only end up embarrassing yourself.” Qing Shui shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if I am not your opponent, I can’t just sit still and see you do as you please. I am a member of the Liu Clan.” The middle-aged man slowly unsheathed his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui heard the person mentioned the thing that he was a person of the Liu Clan, he couldn’t help but feel some sort of admiration towards this man. He was a responsible man. It didn’t matter whether he was a good or bad person, he was one who weighed his responsibility seriously. It was a waste that he was born in a clan like this…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do it. I won’t kill you. Tell the Liu Clan about every single thing which happens today. No matter what happens after that, I will take it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man made his move. He thrust out the long sword in his hand. The sword was like a rainbow. It carried a flash of light with it and was emitting a sort of intimidating energy. The sword was very fast, even faster than those Swift Swords which Qing Shui had seen in the past. However, it didn’t look like the kind of Swift Swords which an assassin possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third uncle of the Third Young Master Liu owned quite a high position in the Liu Clan. His strength was slightly higher compared to Yu Dinghe. Most importantly, his ability in actual combat was impressive. This man had nurtured his knowledge of sword skills for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t retreat but instead charged forward. Since his intention was to scare away his opponent, he might as well use the most direct way to confront him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon-capturing Hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the opponent arrived in front of him, Qing Shui had already managed to capture the opponent with his Dragon-capturing Hands. The opponent went dizzy for a short while. Immediately, Qing Shui quickly drew himself closer to the middle-aged man and unleashed his Buddha Light Seal simultaneously.</span></p>

He then used the back of the sword and struck it on the middle-aged man’s Taiyang Acupoint. Certainly, he controlled his force as he was doing it. Otherwise, the opponent would have died immediately. Following on, he turned his arm around and immediately, the sharp edge of the sword was already pointing at the middle-aged man’s throat. A thread of fresh blood dripped down from his wound.</span></p>

It seemed as though their eyeballs could fall out at any time. They were amazed by what they saw. In terms of strength, Third Grand Master Liu was in the top batch across the Azure Rainbow City. One batch already consisted of a significant amount. It could range from a thousand, ten thousand to maybe even more than a hundred thousand. However, given that the population of Azure Rainbow City surpassed the total population of a country in his previous incarnation by many times, this was considered a very, very small ratio.</span></p>

Anyone could tell that it wouldn’t take Qing Shui a lot of effort to kill Third Grand Master Liu.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where exactly did this young man come from?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;By now, a lot of people had already begun wondering about the origin of this young man.</span></p>

However, in order to do so, it would also require him to possess a certain amount of strength. It was likely that by now, very few people would be able to wrap themselves in tigers’ skins more powerful than his. In fact, Qing Shui could already regard himself as a professional tiger’s skin wrapper by now.</span></p>
