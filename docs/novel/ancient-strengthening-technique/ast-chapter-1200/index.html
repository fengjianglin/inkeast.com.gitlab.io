 <p><strong>AST 1200 - So it’s her! The formidable eldest princess</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t utter a sound, merely looking at the old man in front of him. The gap between their strengths was too large. More importanly, the old man was also adept in using spirit energy and his physical body was also powerful. Even though the old man’s spirit energy wasn’t enough to kill him, his physical attacks could easily do so.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for his own physical body was strong enough, he would have died multiple times from the previous two attacks.</p>
 <p>He took out three golden needles and once again pierced towards his chest. A strong energy burst out from deep within his body. Qing Shui actually still had a thought.</p>
 <p>It was precisely the Spiritual Sense that had been nearby all along. Qing Shui felt that this Spiritual Sense ought to be protecting the princesses and people from the Yan Clan. But why hasn’t it made its move? He could let it pass as before it was only him in danger and after, it was just the little girl in danger. Yet, why had it still not make a move when both Yan Jinyu and Seventh Princess were in danger?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was bewildered and really wanted to take a bet and not act the next time, so as to see if the hidden person would act to save them. However, he didn’t dare to take the gamble.</p>
 <p>He still had a killer move, but he didn’t know if it would work.</p>
 <p>In addition, the Seven-Seven Divine Nebula Formation was done. As he activated his Spiritual Sense, a pure energy started revolving in his body. Qing Shui could already feel that under the effect of the formation, his spiritual attack had increased onefold.</p>
 <p>If a spiritual attack which was almost thirty five thousand nimbus in strength was able to be doubled, it would reach seventy thousand nimbus in strength. Perhaps at that moment it would be able to somewhat threaten the old man.</p>
 <p>“Come, I want to see how long more you can resist!” The old man’s words carried a merciless overtone.</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui was about to use the Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation, the Seventh Princess shouted loudly, “Sister, if you don’t come out, I will face him myself!”</p>
 <p>“Hai!”</p>
 <p>There was a soft sigh. The voice sounded really attractive and extraordinary. Merely listening to it was already very enjoyable.</p>
 <p>A figure sudenly appeared next to the Seventh Princess. When Qing Shui saw the person, he was stunned.</p>
 <p>The woman was wearing casual clothes and wore a bamboo hat. However, the aura she unconsciously gave off made people fatally attracted to her. She was precisely the woman Qing Shui met the other day. Her face still couldn’t be seen and not even her hands were visible. However, she still had a fatal beauty.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could already confirm by now that this woman was the Eldest Princess. The other day when he saw her figure, even though he was shocked, he was already aware of her strength. However, it wasn’t uncommon to run into a strong warrior in the city center. Hence, he never thought that this woman was actually the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>“Sister, it would have been better if you appeared sooner. My friend is injured,” the Seventh Princess said discontentedly.</p>
 <p>In front of this woman, the Seventh Princess was like a small girl. Her usual calm face seemed really emotional at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Eldest Princess!” the Fifth Princess said politely.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Eldest Princess!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi and the others hurriedly saluted her. This was a respect which came from deep in their hearts, which they were delighted to show.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to stand on ceremonies.”</p>
 <p>Her voice made the surroundings sink into a mysterious feeling. That was a kind of enjoyment and amazement within one’s heart. Just by her voice, she could make people feel the distance between them.</p>
 <p>While speaking, the woman extended her hand and grabbed the Fifth Princess. Her other arm had long since been embraced by the Seventh Princess.</p>
 <p>The hand she extended out looked white like snow. That was a kind of lustrous white which resembled that of a jade. Revealing her hand from the secure outfit made it give off a holy charm.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, you’re being too formal. You are about to get married, just call me Elder Sister!” the woman told the Fifth Princess gently.</p>
 <p>These words showed that they most likely hadn’t met in a long time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood there quietly. This woman had come, which was a good thing. It seemed like this woman didn’t actually put the old man in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Eldest Princess? So you are the woman who Young Sect Lord is unable to forget. I would love to see just how special you are.” The old man suddenly charged towards the Eldest Princess, extending his right arm and sending a palm imprint to grab at the Eldest Princess’s bamboo hat.</p>
 <p>“Reckless!”</p>
 <p>The woman waved her hand, directly shooting out a white aura resembling that of a sword Qi.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>The speed of the sword Qi was too fast. It was fast to the point where it was very hard to see it with one’s eyes. She immediately thrust out a long sword Qi and chopped off one of the old man’s arms.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t believe it. She only swung her hand and an entire arm got cut off of the old man’s body. What kind of power was this? As he was previously suppressed by the old man he was the clearest of the old man’s strength.</p>
 <p>What kind of strength was this? Grade Four State Master? Or even higher?</p>
 <p>“Scarlet Flame Sect? Do you guys really think that no one is able to deal with you guys in Scarlet Flame Region? It isn’t unexpected for warriors to kill people. But doing things that anger both people and god, how long do you guys think you guys still have left to live?”</p>
 <p>She said the old man who lost his arm with an indifferent expression, “Go, I reckon you can still hang on until you meet your Young Sect Lord. Help me pass this message, if Scarlet Flame Region doesn’t know its place, I wouldn’t mind eliminating the Scarlet Flame Sect. Just because I don’t do it, it doesn’t mean I am not capable of doing so.”</p>
 <p>As the woman made her move, wave after wave of Sword Qi flashed. The remaining people were immediately terror-stricken. Her voice sounded ethereal yet she killed people with the wave of a hand.</p>
 <p>The old man hurriedly retreated and disappeared into the night sky. He wanted to rush back as soon as possible and see if there was anyone within the sect who could save him.</p>
 <p>“We meet again!” the woman turned around and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded before looking at the little girl beside him. She was still absorbing the energy of the Blood Terminator Bead within her body. However, it seemed to be nearing the end, just that her body was emitting a frightening aura.</p>
 <p>The others felt what the woman said really weird. They never thought that the Eldest Princess had actually seen Qing Shui before. However, Qing Shui didn’t seem interested in her.</p>
 <p>“It’s not suitable for me to continue staying here in my current condition. Since you guys are safe now. I will be taking my leave then. I need to heal my wounds,” Qing Shui told Yan Jinyu, Yan Yangchi and the others.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was telling the truth. He was really badly injured. He didn’t have any feelings for that woman. If it wasn’t because he had seen her once before and that she was the Eldest Princess, he would feel even less for her. Previously, if his body wasn’t strong enough, he would most likely be dead.</p>
 <p>“You are angry at me!” The woman still sounded calm and pleasant to hear.</p>
 <p>“Eldest Princess, you must be joking. Why would I be angry? I am really happy that you appeared. At least I didn’t die. I need to heal my wounds now.” Qing Shui shook his head. He really wasn’t angry, at least not at this woman. She was a strong warrior and he was no different to an ant in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“I have a Spiritual Jade Pellet here. It’s quite effective in healing wounds. Take it!” The woman threw the snow white porcelain bottle toward Qing Shui after she finished speaking.</p>
 <p>“Thanks but it’s alright. I have my own medicine.” Qing Shui smiled and nodded towards the woman. He tossed the medicinal pill back to her, pulling the girl along and flew away.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!” Yan Jinyu yelled.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi and the others also shouted.</p>
 <p>The wman didn’t catch the medicine bottle, letting it fall onto the ground. Qing Shui’s voice then transmitted over, “I will be at Brother Yan’s wedding.”</p>
 <p>When he finished speaking, he brought along the girl and disappeared. He used the Nine Continents Step Effect.</p>
 <p>He understood that for a woman with such strength, she would really look down on him. He knew that this was normal. However, he didn’t like such a behavior. What did this mean? She was taking his life as a joke? Even if she had fun, did he need to be happy for her? Hence, he rejected her medicinal pills. After all, he didn’t need to be in debt to her since he could also heal himself.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui and the girl left, the place immediately turned quiet. The woman stood there. No one was able to see her expression. She was actually feeling quite upset as this was the first time her good intentions got rejected. She only spoke after a long while, “Let’s go back! Things here have ended earlier than expected!”</p>
 <p>“Sister, you aren’t angry right?” the Seventh Princess asked cautiously.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, foolish girl. Do you think just anyone could make me angry? As long as you don’t make me angry, no one else will be able to.” The woman let out a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>It was just a feeling as no one was able to see her expression.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, who is he? Are you close to him?” the woman asked gently.</p>
 <p>“He is a great person. He is Jinyu’s sworn brother. Everyone’s relations are very good.” the Seventh Princess answered promptly.</p>
 <p>“He is quite a nice guy and has quite the character!” the woman said gently.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly used the Nine Continent Steps and brought the girl out of Rong City. He found an empty and vast place to stay for a while. Qing Shui was already slowly recovering. Having taken pills to heal his wounds, he would still need a bit of time to recover.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui examined the little girl. At the moment, she was very quiet, just that the aura released from her body was now a lot, stronger than the first time he met her. The Blood Terminator Bead had awakened in advance. Luckily, he used the Gold Needle to protect her meridians and consciousness at the crucial moment.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui doubted his hearing as he looked at the girl in shock. The little girl actually revealed a gentle smile for the first time.</p>
 <p>It was just that her smile looked a bit forced, which made people feel a bit sad. Qing Shui shook his head, “Why are you being so polite? Even though we aren’t blood related, I still treat you like my own family. My daughters are older than you. I hope you can stay happy like them.”</p>
 <p>The girl blinked her eyes strangely as she looked at Qing Shui but didn’t say anything. However, Qing Shui still felt that he had gotten a bit closer to her.</p>
 <p>“Just practice Taichi fist over here. I am going to treat my wounds. Don’t worry about me. If you want to rest, go into the tent.” Qing Shui set up two tents and also released his demonic beasts so that the girl wouldn’t feel lonely.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal after he entered his tent. By taking a rest here, all his injuries would have fully healed by the time he went out. Previously, he still had half of the time left, which was almost two months of time.</p>
 <p>After forty days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui’s body had already recovered completely. The spiritual qi within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was still sufficient. After he recovered, he began to try out the Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation. Currently, it could double the strength of his spiritual attacks. In a way, it made up for the effect of the Buddha Statue in the past. Not only that, he had also earned himself two times his physical strength and the mighty Seven-Colored Pellets.</p>
 <p>This was good. He had gotten quite a decent harvest from his trip to Rong City. Subsequently he would need to start cultivating again. When he is feeling vexed of cultivating, he could start practicing the Seal of Roc.</p>
 <p>The Seal of Roc was considered a killer move of the Roc Form. Unfortunately, Qing Shui had yet to succeed in cultivating it. Only when he achieved the large success stage or even the Great Perfection Stage would he be able to cultivate the Phoenix Form.</p>
 <p>The Nine Animals Mimicry Technique still had the Dragon and Phoenix Forms. However, currently the most important thing was to succeed in practicing the Seal of Roc.</p>
