 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">For the time being, Qing Shui didn’t plan to focus too much on these matters. The most important thing now was for the overall strength of the Qing Clan to rise. In the future, even without his heritage, he still wanted to ensure that the Qing Clan stood steadily in the continents. The Qing Clan had been carried by him to its position today; there were no more retreating routes for the clan itself.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">He must work hard on nurturing multiple generations within the Qing Clan and also enrich the treasures of the Qing Clan itself. Other than that, he would also need to develop an inheritance exclusive to the Qing Clan and pass it down for multiple generations.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">With all that said, the thing which remained was his bloodline. Qing Shui had begun to notice the presence of his bloodlines in some of his children. For example, Qing Zun and Qing Ming. Both of them would soon develop their respective heritage, being able to pass it down through generations.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Zun’s inheritance was very likely to be the Nature Energy, which could be considered a decent one. The power of justice was firm and fierce. Though he was only taking a moderate pace in terms of increasing his strength, he had a firm foundation and was able to stand steadily on his own. Furthermore, the Nature Energy was an arch-enemy to all evil powers. It was very fierce against certain wicked powers. Hence, the power one could exert against these evil forces would be even more powerful. The Nature Energy was also able to increase the user’s strength and resistance; it also helped to deflect certain attacks caused by negative energies. Overall, it boosted the resistance of the user against negative energies.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Ming’s inheritance, on the other hand, should be the Underworld King’s Energy. Until now, Qing Shui still felt that it was a mystery. Qing Ming was definitely his son, but why was his inheritance so weird? He was concerned that in the future, he might turn out to be the king among assassins. He was also worried about the well being of his bloodline in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Lang, Qing Xiu as well as Qing Teng’s inheritance had made Qing Shui very happy. Theirs was the Nine Yang Inheritance. Though for now, it was still very weak, but in the future they were bound to develop a Nine Yang Bodies.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">His other sons and daughters were also prodigies. It was just that they had yet to realize their heritage. However, Qing Yin and Qing Nuo’s physiques were a bit similar to the Divine Bodies. They might have gotten it from their mothers.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">The reason behind Qing Shui’s discovery today was because he let them take the Bloodline Pellet before this. It was also medical recipes which Qing Shui received in recent years. These medicinal pills were capable of awakening and strengthening the bloodline within their bodies. This was also why he managed to discover Qing Xiu’s bloodline at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Prior to this, Qing Shui hadn’t been really concerned with these questions. It was just that suddenly, he came upon the realization that it was not easy to survive in the continent. Furthermore, by relying on him alone, a clan could only be supported for a temporary period of time. Across history, no matter how powerful a person could get, they would still just be shooting stars that would only last momentarily in the sky. In other words, they would disappear very quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Qing Shui must start planning for the future of the Qing and the Yan Clan. Because of Yan Zhongqiu’s problem, Qing Shui was originally supposed to have the surname Yan and so were his children. Yan Lang was the perfect example for it.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Yan Clan had wronged his mother. No matter how or what reason they had, Qing Shui would never change his name. Other than Yan Lang, the rest of his children were named with the surname Qing.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, Yan Zhongqiu didn’t really care about this matter. No matter what their surname was, his blood still flowed in their bodies. This was the truth which could never be changed.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t that Qing Shui hated his father; he wasn’t in the wrong. The one responsible was the Yan Clan. No matter the reason, he never allowed Qing Shui to forgive the mistakes which the Yan Clan made back then. However, whatever was indebted had already been paid. The people who deserved to die had all passed away.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Many years had passed since then. Right now, Qing Qing was living a good life. Back then, she thought that her father died. When she reunited once again with Yan Zhongqiu later on, she didn’t know if she was feeling shocked or happy, marking a clear difference between her and Qing Shui’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Qing grew up with Yan Zhongqiu. Before she was ten, she had always followed Yan Zhongqiu. After that, Yan Zhongqiu was presumed dead, so she was pleasantly surprised after finding out about his survival.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Zhongqiu had been spending all these years to make up for his daughter. Of course, Qing Shui was no exception. However, because his son was too outstanding, even he himself wasn’t sure how he could make up for it. The two father and son shared a good relationship. The moment when he recovered his memory, he realized that deep down, he loved Qing Yi the most. It was just that since he was still a man, he must be responsible and still regard the Great Yan Dynasty as his home.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Zhongqiu possessed decent strength. Unfortunately, he would never achieve the Divine Grade in his lifetime. False God Realm was his limit and his level would depend on his own efforts.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Not many people from the Qing Clan could achieve the False God Realm. Only Qing Shui, Luan Luan and a few of his highly talented women. As for Shi Qingzhuang, Yuan Su, Zhu Qing, Yun Duan, Huoyun Liu-Li and the others, considering that they hadn’t had any miraculous encounters, it was almost impossible for them to reach such a level.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Despite that, Qing Shui still had his own plans. In the future, many things would not stay the same. He felt that across this boundless World of the Nine Continents, there would definitely be some Divine Grade medicinal pills. They would certainly be able to make some changes to one’s innate talents or maybe, there could also be miraculous medicines which could help a person to make a skyrocketing progress in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">The other way, was to find a remedy which helped to stop a person’s appearance from growing old and also aid to increase longevity. Attaining immortality had never crossed Qing Shui’s mind as he found it to be a bit illogical. However, trying his best to live as long as he could, was still within his capability.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">In Yiye Jiange’s case, throughout these years, Qing Shui had basically tried to help every aspect of her cultivation which Qing Shui felt could be improved. As of now, the most powerful warrior in the Qing Clan was Yehuang Guwu. Even now, she still continued to amaze Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">She cultivated the Tiger Form to the extent that it mutated. Her physique was that of the White Tiger Divine Body. Last night, Qing Shui once again witnessed the white and jade-like body of hers. Everytime he thought about the beautiful scene, he would feel a sense of comfort penetrate deep within his body.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui focused back on his thoughts. When he first came back, he had already found out that she was already a Divine Grade Warrior with two thousand Dao Force worth of strength. Though she was very powerful, Yiye Jiange was even superior to her. There were also Muyun Qingge, Luo Qingcheng, and Qing Hanye…</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">If Yehuang Guwu had been by his side, Qing Shui was confident that she would have been just as powerful as the current Yiye Jiange and the others.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Things were still not too late. The happy moments they shared yesterday had given her great benefits. The unusual effect brought forth by Duo Cultivations would also change depending on the intensity of the participants. When two people constantly stayed together, that was like working steadily on something little by little. However, in their case, if they met every seven to eight years and engaged in Duo Cultivation after so long, the end result would be a small burst in strength each time they interacted.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">In Addition to the Constitution Nurturing as well as the effects provided by medicinal pills like the Quintuple Medical Formula, her strength went through a significant increase as much as two to three folds within a short moment. Following on, for a short period of time, her strength would continue to improve at a frightening pace. It was just like when a river stream reached an outlet.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Yehuang Guwu’s ability to petrify opponents was really great. Her strength had almost reached five thousand Dao Force. In an instant, she went through a one and a half time boost in strength. This could already be considered as a fearsome progress and for the following three months, Qing Shui was confident that her strength would continue to rise by a couple of times. Though there was still a gap between her and Yiye Jiange, the gap would start to become smaller.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, Yehuang Guwu’s actual combat prowess was very terrifying. She was capable of condensing eight White Tigers and each of them could last up to four hours. Their strength was four times her original strength. This could already be considered as a fearsome battle technique.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, Yehuang Guwu didn’t have any Sure-kill Heavenly Technique. Her only advantage was her fast speed and her ability to counteract against 30% of her opponent’s damaging prowess. She also knew a decent footwork, the Nine Palace Step and Taichi Fist as well as the Basic Sword Technique.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui came back, he gave her a set of armor, a sword as well as battle boots and battle armors. They were all at the False God Realm.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Thanks to these, Yehuang Guwu received a significant boost in strength. Though Yehuang Guwu might not have Sure-kill Heavenly Techniques, her ability to summon White Tigers could already be considered as her ultimate technique.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Qing Shui was thinking of all methods to strengthen Yehuang Guwu’s resistance as well as speed and body techniques. As long as her ability to survive improved, she would be a fearsome existence.</span></p>
 <p style="font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px"><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Her White Tiger Divine Technique had reached its peak. At least for now, it would be difficult for it to continue developing, but this was still understandable. If she continued to improve, it would only make life difficult for her.</span></p>
