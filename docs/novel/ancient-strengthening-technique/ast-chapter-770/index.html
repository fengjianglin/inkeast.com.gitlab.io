 <p><strong>AST 770 - Massacre, Preparation</strong></p>
 <p>Donggong Maisun was flustered and scared at the same time. This youth was too strange. Donggong Maisun’s abilities could instantly eliminate even that old freak from the Ye Clan. But this youth had instead obliterated half of his people in a flash. Although he was aware that this youth was capable, this had far exceeded his expectation.</p>
 <p>“If I let you all return now, will you leave?” Qing Shui smilingly looked at Donggong Maisun.</p>
 <p>“Drop the act. You still have to die today,” Donggong Maisun wasn’t going to believe that Qing Shui would let them return so he’d rather choose to fight till the end.</p>
 <p>“Since you choose to not believe it, then prepare for the battle!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately dashed towards Donggong Maisun. His current strength was not in the least bit inferior to them. While he dashed, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant immediately performed the Vajra Subdues Demons.</p>
 <p>This caused the strength of Donggong Maisun and the other remaining elderly man to drop by 10% but their strength was still impressive even after the 10% reduction of their level. With this, their strength was brought to the same level as Qing Shui. To Qing Shui, he wouldn’t have many issues in taking care of cultivators of the same level as him.</p>
 <p>He took out an Agility-Enhancing Fruit and consumed it. His speed then became a lot faster than his opponents. The reduction effect from earlier had also reduced their speed, so normally when the opponent’s abilities were reduced to about Qing Shui’s level, their speed would be a lot more inferior to Qing Shui’s speed. The Cloudmist Steps was still a very powerful skill, especially along with the tremendous effects of the Nine Continent Boots.</p>
 <p>Shield attack!</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>Now that Qing Shui was loosened up, he could fight like a fish back in water. If he could have an absolute advantage in speed, then his success was pretty much guaranteed. Of course, this was provided that the opponents had no trump cards up their sleeves. Qing Shui still seemed to be at ease even when he was fighting against two opponents, mainly because his Silver Needle could keep the other elderly man at bay.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Donggong Maisun became increasingly sullen and frustrated the longer the fight went on. He was worried because he could sense death creeping up closer to him yet he couldn’t do anything about it. A clear noise rang out as Qing Shui’s Thunder God collided against Donggong Maisun’s shoulder, exposing a patch of dark green color beneath.</p>
 <p>The Jade-Armored Immortal Garb!</p>
 <p>After Donggong Taiqing passed away, this Jade-Armored Immortal Garb was worn by Donggong Maisun. It seemed like it was for the purpose of ambushing him tonight. It was already past one o’clock in the morning right now. The Jade-Armored Immortal Garb had naturally withstood a fatal injury for Donggong Maisun. During the same moment, Donggong Maisun flung his left arm towards Qing Shui. Something akin to a flash of faint green light shot out from it. Qing Shui was startled for a moment. He felt something like a needle prick his wrist. Damn it!</p>
 <p>“HAHAHA!” Donggong Maisun took a few steps back as he let out a loud laugh instead. Qing Shui then saw a green snake of about five feet long and as thick as his pinky on Donggong Maisun’s arm. Realization struck him. His opponent had a Poison Beast too. Just how many people in the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan possessed a Poison Beast?</p>
 <p>This green snake was a Four Colored Peak Poison Beast, Green Bamboo Snake. Qing Shui was extremely nervous as he quickly retrieved a Pure Jade Pellet and ingested it. He then activated Nature Energy to its peak before he sprinted towards Donggong Maisun. He must eliminate him in the shortest amount of time.</p>
 <p>He took out a Frosted Iron Ball that had been dipped in poison and quickly launched a Meteor Smash at Donggong Maisun. The elderly man had his hands full dealing with the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable to one side. The cultivator with five stars strength was barely able to resist the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable and he didn’t seem to be able to last much longer. This made Qing Shui extremely happy. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable indeed still had a lot of room for improvement. At the same time, he felt extremely fortunate about the Flower of Life in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and for waiting around at the Zuoshi Aristocrat Clan. He actually obtained one of the Five Colored Poison Beasts, the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. As for Six Colored and Seven Colored Poison Beasts, they were all legendary beings. He was guessing that it was because no one was still alive after meeting any one of them.</p>
 <p>The expression on the face of Donggong Maisun, who was familiar with poison, changed greatly when he saw that pitch black Frosted Iron Ball. He quickly evaded, but unfortunately the Meteor Smash had pinpointed its target’s qi and would lock onto its target until its qi had vanished. Qing Shui took out another ordinary Frosted Iron Ball and launched it again. He forced Donggong Maisun to a corner and sealed off his only escape route.</p>
 <p>Donggong Maisun, who was trapped with no room to advance or retreat, brandished the gigantic blade in his hand and slashed across the incoming Frosted Iron Ball. He knew very well that this thing could be fatal.</p>
 <p>Crack!</p>
 <p>The Frosted Iron Ball shattered. Donggong Maisun quickly backed off as soon as he saw the black specks!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>However, the other Frosted Iron Ball from behind pierced through his thigh. A pitch black shard from the Frosted Iron Ball got into his body when he was distracted by the immense pain. At the same time, Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable’s front claw clawed across the elderly man’s throat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew the battle here was about to end soon. It wasn’t even five minutes long and all seven Peak Martial Saint cultivators were killed. Seven. Not too many but not too little either, it was enough to cause a heartache to the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan. But to Qing Shui, this was only the beginning.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stashed away Donggong Maisun’s Jade-Armored Immortal Garb and also the dead Green Bamboo Snake. It was killed by him later and now he was still wondering why he didn’t have any reaction after being bitten by the Green Bamboo Snake</p>
 <p>Although his Nature Energy had broken through to the fifth level, his Yin-Yang Image had also broken through to a stronger realm. Qing Shui had a suspicion why the Four Colored Poison Beast’s poison was ineffective on him and this was connected to the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. The first time he fed it the Flower of Life, he could feel a strange connection forming between him and the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. Perhaps this connection could be have been the reason. Furthermore, Qing Shui actually had a very strong immunity to poison. Since it was a good thing, Qing Shui didn’t bother to find out the exact reason.</p>
 <p>He immediately set the dead bodies on fire. Ye Guyan had been staring at Qing Shui with disbelief in her eyes ever since the battle ended. Everything around her became unreal, and even Qing Shui seemed like a stranger.</p>
 <p>She looked at the sky. A glimmer of white light could be seen at the horizon to the East. Day was breaking soon.</p>
 <p>On the contrary, Ye Clan’s Old Man had a very satisfied smile on his face. His mood was greatly lifted. Although the old man seemed to be at ease earlier, he was more anxious than anyone else. The fate of the entire Ye Clan was on Qing Shui’s shoulders. It was impossible for him to not be worried.</p>
 <p>“Senior, Miss Ye, you should all head back to rest. I can’t sleep anymore so I’ll just practise my fist techniques for awhile.” Qing Shui told Ye Clan’s old man and Ye Guyan with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Alright, then this old man shall retire to bed.” Ye Clan’s old man let out a refreshing laugh before walking towards a house nearby, where his bedroom was. The fight just now didn’t take place at the Ye Residence. Otherwise there wouldn’t be any houses left standing.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan didn’t leave though. She was still standing not far from Qing Shui while she stared at him blankly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed her gaze so he turned around to look at this woman of unrivalled beauty on Earth. “Miss Ye!”</p>
 <p>An unnatural smile broke across Ye Guyan’s face as she averted her eyes from Qing Shui’s gaze. She looked at the sky and excused herself before turning around to leave. This puzzled Qing Shui but he cast away all his distracting thoughts and adopted his Taichi stance, facing the East. The ‘Minute Subtlety’ had been gradually progressing. The progress was very slow but as time went on, its immense effect could be observed. This was a cultivation art that progressively grew stronger over a long period of time. There were little bits of improvement every day and although it was not very obvious, as time passed, one would suddenly discover that they had gone very far.</p>
 <p>This was exactly how Qing Shui felt right now. All of a sudden, he had discovered that the ‘Minute Subtlety’ was already at quite a decent realm. Just by seeing and sensing this made him feel proud and have a sense of accomplishment. Although it was time consuming, the realm was quite high once he got a firm grasp on it. That was because things that took time to build up were usually the most practical.</p>
 <p>The Back Connecting Fist of Large Success Stage had once again reached its peak. Qing Shui no longer deliberately chased after breakthroughs because he understood that haste does not necessarily bring success and he believed that effort will undoubtedly lead to success. For now, he only focused on cultivating diligently. Perhaps accidental surprises were more likely to come just by keeping his mind in a relaxed state.</p>
 <p>When the day turned slightly brighter, the Ye Clan’s old man woke up and brought everyone else with him. Since it was already morning, the people from Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan weren’t going to come anymore. Besides, Qing Shui felt like those seven people including Donggong Maisun had came here in secret.</p>
 <p>He had a hunch that the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan must have known about what happened by now. Although they would find it hard to believe, they’d definitely vent all their grudges during Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death.</p>
 <p>During breakfast, Ye Guyan ate a lot more than usual. This was the most he had seen her eating since the past few days. The expression on her face seemed to be a lot more relaxed now and Ye Yan couldn’t stop staring at her.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, what is it, Yan’er?” Ye Guyan smiled at her younger sister who was sitting beside her.</p>
 <p>“You seem to be very happy today?” Ye Yan asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Am I?” Ye Guyan laughed awkwardly.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Ye Yan pointed out firmly.</p>
 <p>“That’s enough. Finish your food quickly, little girl,” Ye Guyan chuckled as she urged her.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji and the rest could feel something through Ye Guyan. They looked at Qing Shui. They felt like they had never seen Qing Shui in a panic before. He had never yielded no matter how difficult things got. He had never become dejected or complained either. He just silently shouldered everything alone and ended up doing incredible things that would surprise everyone again and again.</p>
 <p>……....</p>
 <p>The Martial God Street was crowded today. It was already packed with people early in the morning. The Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death was a rare event. It was even rare to see a clan like the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan participating in it, so this place was basically packed with the cultivators who could make it here today.</p>
 <p>The big clans already had a fixed spot here so it didn’t matter if they came early or late, unlike ordinary people who wouldn’t even have a place to stand if they were late. So some people came super early and some had stayed around since yesterday.</p>
 <p>The people who knew that the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death would take place here today were all here. There were people everywhere along the entire Martial God Street and even some flying beasts in the sky but most of them were over somewhere a little further.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t even late in the morning and yet many big clans had already arrived. The atmosphere today was livelier than yesterday. Conversations flowed freely where there were many people. It was quite chaotic. There were discussions and heated arguments everywhere around here.</p>
 <p>“I bet that young man cannot even last for fifteen minutes.”</p>
 <p>“Get lost. I bet that young man can eliminate the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Idiot. You really think one young man can shake up a supreme aristocratic clan?”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t Yun Feiyang eliminate a supreme aristocratic clan all by himself a thousand years ago? And three thousand years ago, Yiye Wuxin eliminated a few supreme sects,” someone retorted in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Well…..” the person stammered, unable to think of anything else to say.</p>
