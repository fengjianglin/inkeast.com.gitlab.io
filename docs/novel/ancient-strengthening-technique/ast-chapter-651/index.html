 <p><strong>AST 651 - Prescription for the Heaven defying Fate Pill, Diamond Gigantic Elephant using the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was slightly worried since the success rate was only 10%. It was extremely low. In spite of that, he still planned to attempt refining it. He wondered what the limitations and restrictions to the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet were.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that there were enough medicinal herbs to refine three sets of Demon Beast Advancing Pellets. He just did not know if there would be only one or multiple pills if he was successful. However, there was an unspoken rule in alchemy that the higher the grade of the medicinal pill, the lesser the amount produced when succeeding.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was quite satisfied with this prescription. After all, all his demonic beasts were Mutated Beasts of Heaven and Earth, and there was definitely room for them to grow. Although the success rate was only 10%, Qing Shui still decided to gamble on it.</p>
 <p>He finally placed his gaze on the last prescription and the following words appeared before him.</p>
 <p>Fate Pill!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that it would be amazing just by looking at the name. When he saw the medicinal herbs in the prescription, Qing Shui was astonished. This was the oldest medicinal herbs he had ever required.</p>
 <p>The youngest ones were also at about 3000 Year, with requirements for most of them to be at 5000 Year. Qing Shui even saw that it required the Flower of Life, Peach of Immortality and ingredients from high level Martial Saint Grade Demonic Beasts. They were all very valuable items, and most importantly, there were the words ‘Mysterious Fruit’.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put down the prescription and once again looked at the box on the table. He saw that there were no "Flower of Life" and "Peach of Immortality". There were no high level Martial Saint level demonic beasts either.</p>
 <p>"I can't get all the ingredients listed in this prescription yet. I can get the ingredients from demonic beasts if I were to pay a price for them, but it's almost impossible to buy or trade for the ‘Flower of Life’ and ‘Peach of Immortality’. I thought of looking for them in those dangerous mountainous terrains or ancient forests, but it's far too dangerous. Therefore, this prescription is pretty much of little use. The reason I've brought it here today is to see if there's any way of replacing them with other ingredients. If we were able to find replacements, if successfully refined, even if the effects of the pills were lowered, it should still be pretty good." Yuan Su said, slightly embarrassed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded, but thought to himself gleefully as he had both the ‘Flower of Life’ and ‘Peach of Immortality’. As for the ingredients from high level demonic beasts, there's the Red Jiao. Qing Shui felt that even the heavens seemed to be helping him.</p>
 <p>He took a look at the medicinal effects. With such precious ingredients, this Fate Pill would definitely be able to change a person's fate, allowing one to have rapid improvements and stand at the very top.</p>
 <p>Effect: Cultivators below Martial Saint would be able to increase their strength to one to three countries. Cultivators above Martial Saint level would be able to have their strength increased to 500 countries or more, depending on their individual potential.</p>
 <p>Prerequisite: Must be at least a Xiantian cultivator!</p>
 <p>Restrictions: Only one could be taken in a lifetime!</p>
 <p>In this moment, Qing Shui was truly astonished. If the effects were really as written, then this Fate Pill was truly heaven defying. It allowed a Xiantian cultivator to immediately reach Peak Martial King level, having his life changed completely.</p>
 <p>This medicinal pill depended on the individual's potential to determine the effects, but even the weakest Xiantian cultivator would be able to reach Peak Martial King. However, at this point in time, Qing Shui still focused mainly on himself.</p>
 <p>This was because, if a Martial Saint Grade cultivator were to take it, depending on the person's potential, he could reach a strength of 500 countries. Qing Shui have no doubt over his potential. If he could succeed in refining this, Qing Shui would be able to reach at least Grade Four Martial Saint ...</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Qing Shui force himself not to think of it too much. Otherwise, if he were to fail, the blow would be too heavy. Even now, Qing Shui could feel that his blood was starting to boil.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that it was primarily because he was at a crucial point that he especially wished for his prowess to be increased. This medicinal pill was extremely heaven defying but the ingredients were too hard to find. Even for Qing Shui who had a Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it would take him at least two years before he could gather enough ingredients to make a single attempt. Not many people could be like Qing Shui, to be able to utilise multiple times of his body's powers. Of course, it would be different for people with Divine Artifacts, but there weren’t many who had.</p>
 <p>Therefore, this Fate Pill was a heaven defying divine pill to those suited to take it. It was sufficiently powerful to be able to allow ordinary Martial Saint grade cultivators to increase their strength to 500 countries, bringing them from Grade Five to Grade Six Martial Saint level. It was not that easy to rise from Grade Five to Grade Six Martial Saint level. Each grade at the Martial Saint level had many people unable to progress to the next grade.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave it some thought. Even if he were to let everyone in Qing Clan take one, it would still take him decades. To have more than ten or twenty members improve to Peak Martial King cultivators or Martial Saint level cultivators over that years was a feat unheard of in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, Qing Shui kept the medicinal herbs and prescriptions in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He then turned to Yuan Su and said, "Is it convenient to share what cultivation level those uncles of yours are at?"</p>
 <p>"One of them is at Grade Eight Martial Saint, should be about the same as Uncle Di Xuan's level. The other two uncles can also reach Uncle Di Xuan's level under the enhancements of medicinal pills." Yuan Su felt a little helpless when she said this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew what she was thinking. After all, there was too much of a gap between their cultivation level and their opponents’. However, the Alchemist Sect should be able to sense that the Di Clan had strong external support. After all, an expert like Old Demon Ba had already died in the Di Clan.</p>
 <p>Although there were still a gap in their abilities, Qing Shui was still especially happy. Earlier, Qing Shui knew that at least two, at max five could take part in the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death. Qing Shui was originally worried about sending five of them since not many of them were at Grade Eight Martial Saint level...</p>
 <p>Now, there should be enough of them and Qing Shui felt more at ease. He could only think of refining the prescriptions he had successfully. As long as he could reach the cultivation level that matched theirs, he would be able to deal with them in ease. As long as an expert of that level did not appear.</p>
 <p>Just then, Di Chen and Di Qing walked over. Yuan Su waved and greeted them.</p>
 <p>"Sister Yuan Su, are you guys done with your discussion?" Di Qing smiled, the four of them sat around the stone table.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surrounded by three ladies of unparalleled beauty. The dream that he had in his previous life was now fulfilled. However, out of the three, Di Chen was the only one he loved.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, do you think we'll die this time around?" Di Qing turned to asked Qing Shui, her tone was so casual that it was hard to tell what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>"Why, are you already sick of living?" Qing Shui asked as he looked at Di Qing, feeling puzzled.</p>
 <p>"I don't want to see that terrifying scene." Di Qing was not agitated by Qing Shui's words. She merely spoke with a hint of worry.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, trust me, nothing will happen." Qing Shui looked at Di Qing. This was her home. If anything were to happen, she would be very much aggrieved.</p>
 <p>Di Chen's expression also appeared slightly perturbed. Otherwise, she wouldn't have tried to advise Qing Shui to leave previously. She did not think that the Di Clan would be able to resolve this situation properly, but there was nothing they could do to avoid it.</p>
 <p>"Really? You're not lying to me?"</p>
 <p>When people are at their frailest moments, even a single word of consolation would be able to let them feel at peace. If Qing Shui were to say something else altogether, it was likely that she would breakdown. After all, Qing Shui's strength played a huge part in this.</p>
 <p>"Of course. When have I ever lied to you?"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui could not wait and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He then cultivated his Ancient Strengthening Technique to calm himself down before he started studying the prescriptions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started with the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet. He repeated looked over each type of medicinal herb listed in the prescription, then analyzed their medicinal properties.</p>
 <p>After taking some time to study and to understand their medicinal properties, he remembered the different points of information such as which were easier to fuse, what properties they had after fusing, as well as which remaining medicinal herbs they would fuse better with. Qing Shui's memory was pretty strong now and could be said that he would be remember things with just one look. In fact, those who were at Martial Saint and higher would all have exceptional memory and would be able to remember things with a few looks, even if not with the first. It was because those who could raise up to the Martial Saint level were all considered the cream of the crop.</p>
 <p>After making his preparations, Qing Shui started to refine the medicine. This time around, he was extra careful. It may be because there was a shortage of the medicinal herbs, or because the medicinal pill this time around was more valuable or more important.</p>
 <p>He activated his Spiritual Sense!</p>
 <p>He released his aura as a habit. Qing Shui felt that this would increase the success rate of his alchemy as well as increase the quality of the product.</p>
 <p>Everything progressed smoothly, just as Qing Shui imagined. However, before he succeeded, Qing Shui did not dare let his guard down.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui did not wish to fail in refining the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet. After all, there was only a 10% success rate after a demonic beast had taken this Demon Beast Advancing Pellet. Therefore, one additional pill meant one additional hope.</p>
 <p>The Golden Flint Iron Cauldron started to give out a gurgling sound. Qing Shui calmly used the primordial flames to heat up the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, ready to change the degree of the heat and proceed with the fusing of the medicinal herbs.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a bright grey-colored glow exploded from Qing Shui's Primordial Flames. Just then, a clear sound rang out from the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Primordial Flames lowered down gradually until they finally disappeared. Qing Shui let out a long exhale. He had succeeded on his first attempt of the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet and it was considered to be a good start.</p>
 <p>About one hour later, Qing Shui gradually opened the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and noticed the two Demon Beast Advancing Pellets in it. They were the size of a baby's fist and were a crimson red, exuding a fragrance. There was a faint red glow around it, giving it an additional mysterious feel.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then gathered his focus to finish up with the other two batches, getting six Demon Beast Advancing Pellets in total. Qing Shui was very satisfied, but he was started to worry a little.</p>
 <p>A ten percent success rate... It was likely that all six of them would go to waste...</p>
 <p>Gritting his teeth, Qing Shui called for his Diamond Gigantic Elephant. The Fire Bird could not eat it and as it was at Peak Martial King level, so there's no use for it to take this. The Thunderous Beast was still in its growth stage and it was still young, therefore the pills could only be used by the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Moreover, if the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could advance in level, Qing Shui would also benefit greatly. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant swallowed the first Demon Beast Advancing Pellet. Qing Shui watched as it savoured it. He looked in anticipation at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, waiting for that moment of excitement.</p>
 <p>In this moment, Qing Shui felt very conflicted. He hope that time would pass faster, but yet hope that it would go more slowly. To speak the truth, he was afraid that the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet had no effect.</p>
