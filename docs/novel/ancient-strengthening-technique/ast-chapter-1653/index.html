 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wedding procedure went on very smoothly. RIght now, Qing Shui wasn't afraid that people who didn't know any better would come and create trouble. It was a joyful event after all. Even though he wasn't worried that others would do so, he didn't like the idea of people creating trouble either. As time passed, the guests slowly took their leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who weren't on that close a relationship left earlier and it was only those who were close to them who had stayed longer. However, in the evening, most of them had already left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The members of the Qing Clan sat together. Although there weren't that many members of the Qing Clan around today, they still increased in numbers. The younger generation had moved up and Qing Shui's generation had also begun to start their own families.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange sat next to Qing Shui, wearing a faint smile but feeling very strange. From today onward, she would be his. Although she was already his over half a year ago or even longer, it was only now that she realized that this ceremony was very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people said that they did not care much about the ceremony and that it would be enough if the two of them were in love and could be together. Nothing else would matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was true as well. Like they said, what was the use of sweet nothings? Even so, why was it that many people would still say them? Ceremonies, especially this one, regardless if it was a luxurious one or a simple one, was still very important. This was also why Qing Shui gave each of his women an independent wedding ceremony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange served tea to Qing Yi and Yan Zhongyue. It was the custom here. Qing Shui's previous life didn't have such a custom. Qing Yi took out a bangle and put it onto Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother Qing Shui, you're really capable." Qing You chuckled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui maintained a very casual relationship with the members of the Qing Clan who were in his generation. This was something that he wanted. No matter how strong he was, everyone was brothers to each other. They could share anything between them and could joke around as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Did you only just realize that Brother Shui is very capable? But no matter how capable he is, he's still my elder brother. Are there any gifts for me this time around?" Qing Bei asked happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw Qing Bei acting like this, he smiled and took out quite a nice longsword and battle skirt, handing it to her. They were all nicely packaged. These items had been prepared for her to begin with but he hadn't had the chance to give them to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took the opportunity to take out some other gifts and distributed to the rest. Everyone had a share.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone came together and chat about some interesting things. Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui's children and realized that they had already grown up. Yiye Jiange had carried Qing Teng and Qing Nuo before, and the two of them weren't distant with her either. They would run over to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange and could not help but recall the scene when he had brought Luan Luan back at the very beginning. Luan Luan and Yiye Jiange shared a close resemblance to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that it was getting late, the rest returned as well. This place was Qing Shui's and Yiye Jiange's bridal chamber. Qing Shui rubbed his nose. His children were already so old and yet, he was still getting married...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, situations like this were normal for the nine continents. Very normal, in fact. Despite so, Qing Shui was someone who held two sets of beliefs after all. Although in his previous life, where there were also people who had gotten married while having their own kids, this was a completely different case in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others had all left and Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui's weird smile and could not help but say, "Your smile looks very strange."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right. I already have so many children and they're all so old now. Sometimes, when I think about it, I feel as if I'm dreaming." Qing Shui knew why he felt this way. He wasn't around at home much. When Qing Zun and Qing Yin were born, he was around, but ever since then, they were more often apart than they were together. Unknowingly, the children had all grown up and he felt that he wasn't a qualified father to his children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you feel that you haven't done a good job?" Yiye Jiange was very bright and could tell the self-blame from Qing Shui's tone. She could guess what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right. I haven't spend a lot of time with them, let alone the effort to nurture them. It's been hard on their mothers. Sometimes, I feel that I owe you all." Qing Shui said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, he really felt like stopping and stay for a very, very long time at home to spend time with them. However, there were many things which he had to settle and he now knew the feeling of being helplessly compelled by the situation. There were many things which were no longer within his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"But you've set a good example for them. Didn't you see that your children all have a special feeling toward you? You're a powerful father and they should know about you as well. In their hearts, you're a good father. That's all that matters. You don't necessarily have to stay by their side." Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui with a gentle expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Qing Shui heard Yiye Jiange's words, he immediately felt a lot better. What she said was correct as well. In his previous life, there was a saying that a crooked stick would have a crooked shadow. Parents were the best role models for their children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"In the future, when we have our own children, will you tell them about the things that happened to us after we met?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange's face flushed up, "Who's going to bear children for you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at her shy expression, Qing Shui carried her up and said, "The wedding night is the most wonderful night in one's lifetime. Let's go and make children."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're a scoundrel..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, both Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange woke up very early. Yiye Jiange woke up earlier than Qing Shui. She didn't wish to let the other sisters tease her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, the time that Qing Shui spent at home wasn't considered short. He stayed for over 20 days. Of course, he didn't waste his time here. There were many things to do at night and he would almost have to run one round every night, enjoying a wonderful night life. Thankfully, his body was very strong. If it was in his previous life, there would probably no one who would be able to handle this. Even in the nine continents, there weren't many people who could endure this. The Nine Yang Golden Body allowed him to have a body that was of an extreme yang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the day, Qing Shui would help the ladies as well as the younger generation to strengthen their foundations. With the Benevolent Golden Budhha, the effects were even better than before. With his women, he had that amazing Duo Cultivation Technique that could stabilize their powers even more, their physiques would improve, and there would also be a mysterious power. This should be the forces of yin and yang in that amazing technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The younger generation grew stronger very quickly as well. Luan Luan was still extremely powerful and her demonic beasts were even more so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this time, Qing Shui had also gone to the Putuo Mountain. Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan had both came to the Qing Clan as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen would come by occasionally. After all, Di Qing was here and that was probably why she would come. Otherwise, Di Chen rarely came by. Di Qing would spend half the time in the Lotus Sect and Di Chen liked Qing Nuo a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen and Qing Shui had gotten married as well, a few days apart from the Eldest Princess. Right now, amongst his women, Tantai Lingyan was the only one who wasn't married to Qing Shui. Even Yu Ruyan had gotten married to him.</span></p>

After all, he was the youngest. It was unknown if it was because his surname was Yan or for some other reason but he liked to be with Yan Zhongyue a lot.</span></p>

The two of them were like close friends yet they were also like lovers. However, they had never gone past the last stage nor did they talk about marriage.</span></p>

Qing Shui didn't force her either. He didn't know what Yuan Su was thinking but they had plenty of time in the future. He wanted to give her time.</span></p>

Lotus Sect, Heaven Secrets Academy, and the Putuo Mountain were all around the Qing Clan. They kept a low profile but were tied together by countless connections with the Qing Clan. Qing Shui's women all joined one of the influences.</span></p>

For the past month, Di Chen, the Eldest Princess, and Yiye Jiange were all at the Qing Clan. After all, there was the Qing Clan’s manor and Qing Zun and the others all had their own independent courtyards. This was also for the sake of their cultivation.</span></p>

They wanted to stay during this time as well. Even if they were to share Qing Shui's time between them, he would still be able to be with them for two days each. Moreover, there would also be a lot of time for them to be alone together.</span></p>

Coming back from the Qing Clan, Qing Shui felt that this seemed to be another home of his. After so many years, these two places were the places which felt like home to him. This was also why Qing Clan treated Yu Niang just like he would to an elder sister.</span></p>
