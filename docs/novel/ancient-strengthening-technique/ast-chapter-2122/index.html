 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without realizing it, a week had passed. The Imperial Cuisine Hall ran its business just like every other day, and its reputation was slowly increasing. Naturally, there would still be some fools trying to challenge the hall. But most of them would end up in a very miserable state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also some troubles with people wanting to buy the foods by force. For example, there had been people, who proclaimed themselves to be of high status, coming and demanding to buy the food only to realize that it had been sold out. Those people would then start demanding Qing Shui to prepare it on the spot in great amounts. Naturally, things also didn’t end that well for those guys.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the hall was earning so much money, there would naturally be a lot of people wanting to take it over for themselves. Those who lived in the lights, as well as those who lived under the spotlight, had come. But in return, all that they got were paybacks. Naturally, those with wicked intentions suffered greater pain whereas the injuries of those, who didn’t harbor any bad intentions, weren’t as serious. But they still couldn’t get away from having one of their legs snapped at the very least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, I have already managed to get some news about it.” On this day, Nuo Lan looked for Qing Shui, saying this to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What news?” Qing Shui was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“News about the Five Tigers Immortal Sect.” Nuo Lan answered back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately overwhelmed with excitement. He said hurriedly, “Tell me about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Five Tigers Immortal Palace is related to Five Tigers Immortal Sect. The Five Tigers Immortal Sect stands directly under the Five Tigers Immortal Palace. In other words, the two are actually one entity.” Nuo Lan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knitted his brows, “I am a bit confused.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The clan that once ruled over the Five Tigers Immortal Palace established the Five Tigers Immortal Sect. However, the person leading the Five Tigers Immortal Palace has changed now and is no longer from the clan that ruled it once before. Despite that, the Five Tigers Immortal Sect is still a branch of the Five Tigers Immortal Palace. They are quite strong and have quite a high authority in the immortal palace itself.” Nuo Lan explained to QIng Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knitted his brows. It seemed the things this time wouldn’t be as simple as he thought. If he wanted to help Tantai Lingyan solve her problems, he would have to face off against the Five Tigers Immortal Palace. But the current Five Tigers Immortal Palace shared a close relation with Demons Gate. Even if the Divine Palace and Taiyi Immortal Palace were to combine their forces, they still wouldn’t stand a chance against those two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan knew that there had been conflicts between Qing Shui and Five Tigers Immortal Sect before. But judging by how the current situation was, it seemed that he wouldn’t be able to solve it immediately. Thus, after a moment of hesitation, she said, “Since you have waited for so many years, you should be happy to finally get to hear some news about them. The time is on your side anyway. Why don’t you take it step by step?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt warm hearing these caring words. He nodded. Indeed, it was a thing to be happy about. However, Qing Shui never planned to tell Tantai Lingyan about it for the time being. He should wait for a suitable time and only tell her when he was strong enough to handle her mortal enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you!” Qing Shui sneaked a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Here you go again with your formality.” Nuo Lan let out a sigh of relief when she saw Qing Shui doing so. She was honestly worried that Qing Shui would go and look for the Five Tigers Immortal Palace directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are the female owner after all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you feel uncomfortable not being able to take advantage of me?” Nuo Lan wasn’t angry. She gave Qing Shui a kind of seductive look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that, Qing Shui immediately avoided contact with her eyes. While in front of this woman, he was not only unable to take advantage of her after being seduced, but he would also end up embarrassing himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan could tell that Qing Shui was being shy. Moreover, his desire to investigate her body wasn’t really that strong. He was just like a big baby. Actually, under these circumstances, it was not that he never thought about it, but it had something to do with his conscience. Despite being already married and have his own children, he would still feel a bit shy at times. Nevertheless, he was still, already completely different from the teenage boy he once was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you really married?” From Qing Shui’s look, she could tell that he wasn’t faking it. Before this, Nuo Lan even suspected Qing Shui to be a virgin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, Nuo Lan gave Qing Shui an even weirder look, so much that she began examining his body from the top all the way down. Could he have problems in that department? Otherwise, how else could she explain his bashfulness despite being so outstanding?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a blink of an eye, Qing Shui managed to understand how Nuo Lan felt by looking into her eyes. He immediately got upset. How could a man be underestimated like this? While thinking about it, he felt a sort of reaction at the bottom part of his body. Slowly, it erected, “I am a normal man……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan shot a gaze at Qing Shui. When she saw the tent sticking out at the lower part of his body, her face reddened, and she opened her mouth slightly. Shortly after, she turned around and vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui lowered his head to look at his ‘lil bro’. By now, he had also calmed down. He didn’t know why he got so agitated before. Also, when Nuo Lan had been staring down right at his erected manhood, her surprised look alone was enough to snatch his heart away. Until now, the scene still hadn’t left his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui calmed himself down. Now, he was filled with motivations once again. In the past, he had made up his mind to help Tantai Lingyan solve the things in her heart. At one point in the past, the Five Tigers Immortal Sect slaughtered everyone from her clan. Naturally, she must avenge her family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What went beyond Qing Shui’s expectations was that the things revolving Tantai Lingyan would actually relate to the Demons Gate. Even if Tantai Lingyan’s problem never existed, the Divine Palace would continue to battle against the Demons Gate. Naturally, Taiyi Immortal Palace and the Five Tigers Immortal Palace also wouldn’t just sit still and watched as the battle unfolded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was great, it had encouraged Qing Shui even more to obliterate the Five Tigers Immortal Palace and Demons Gate. Considering that the Five Tigers Immoral Sect could get along well with Demons Gate, they would naturally not be any upright organizations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demons Gate called themselves the Saintly Gate. Due to the Demon Lords Blood within them, they did things based on their own desires. It was in their nature to find it hard to resist any form of seductions. For example, if an ordinary man saw a beautiful woman, he wouldn’t dare to do any shit because there were too many things which he must worry about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the people of Demons Gate wouldn’t hesitate to violate the poor woman. To them, the most important thing was their own self-satisfaction. It was precisely because of this that the Demons Gate became arch-enemies with the Divine Palace. In the righteous world, the actions demonstrated by Demons Gate was considered to be immoral, uncivilized, and intolerable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were too many human beings across this world. In comparison to this huge number, the amount of people in Demons Gate was infinitesimal. Thus, even if a lot of the people from Demons Gate were to do bad stuff, it wouldn’t halt the society from developing, let alone some of them would even be stopped by other people. Even without the people of Demons Gate, things like a massacre, being raped or kidnapped were also happening every day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, Nuo Lan came down from upstairs. She looked very normal. Qing Shui was the one who looked awkward when he saw her. He said embarrassingly, “Sister Nuo Lan, I was not trying to be rude, I just wanted to prove it to you that I am normal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Just prove it to whoever you want. What does it have to do with me.” Nuo Lan was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I would love to prove it to you. It’s like if I don’t, I will keep feeling something strange in my heart. Now that I have let you know that I am in perfect shape, there is nothing more which I shall worry about.” Qing Shui shamelessly blurted, as though he were the all-knowing wiseman.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright, I’ll stop talking about this. Speaking of which, who made an appointment to see me today?” Qing Shui changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You know this person. She is also very unusual. She is the mistress of Rain Flower Pavilion.” Nuo Lan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. The Rainflower Pavilion wasn’t exactly a sect that was considerably powerful in Northern Emperor Domain. However, it could still be considered one of the first-class sects, as they had a lot of influence around the area. The sect was also formed solely by women cultivator. It might not be an Immortal Sect or an Immortal Palace, but it could count as an existence which could rival them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people in Rainflower Pavilion were all beautiful women. They didn’t put any restrictions on each of their members. The women were allowed to get married, and even after they had given birth, they could still be a member of the pavilion. The people in Rainflower Pavilion worked together as one. Among these women, a lot of them had gotten married into aristocratic clans or disciples from certain sects. Slowly, they started forming their connections and expand their networks, so much that they might even have hidden power which no one knew about. As of now, it was already almost at the same level as Divine Palace and Taiyi Immortal Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main thing about the Rainwater Pavilion was that it had a lot of influence on the area around it. If anyone stupid were to lay their hands on the Rainwater Pavilion, they would likely suffer a pathetic death. This knowledge had been passed on for a very long time. According to rumors, it was even said that the mistress of Rainwater Pavilion had a lot of trump cards up her sleeves. Qing Shui had heard many things about the group, but yet he had never interacted with them. That was why this time, he didn’t know what the mistress could be asking for by coming here. He had already stated specifically that he would only attend to terminal illnesses.</span></p>
