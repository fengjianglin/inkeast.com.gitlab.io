 <p><strong>Chapter 507 Injuring Huang Qing, Martial Saint of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord appears.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 507 - Injuring Huang Qing, Martial Saint of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord appears</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could it be that if the women from the Portraits of Beauty were not people who would help him, then they would be a big obstacle to him…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui was not feeling very comfortable, Qing Shui was suddenly very worried about Wenren Wu-shuang, she was of one woman from the Portraits of Beauty. He was afraid of the changes in personality, there was a connection between him and her sister’s death, if she filled herself with hate, she might walk an extreme path, possibly becoming like Sword Demon Huang Qing, who was in front of him…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, who had improved tremendously, found out that Huang Qing actually had a terrifying level of strength, Qing Shu felt that there must be something on her that amplified her growth rate. Furthermore, with that extraordinary longsword in her hands, she should be even more terrifying.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Why did she not kill him the last time? Qing Shui was confused for a moment. Could he defeat her today? Could it be that only one of them can walk out alive today?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that these Divine Bodies of the Portraits of Beauty all had great abilities, just that there were not awakened yet, Qing Shui now felt that the Misty Hall Palace Mistress would not be inferior to Huang Qing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the abilities of Yiye Jiange had been sealed, this feeling of Qing Shui’s grew stronger as he gained more strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for Wenren Wu-shuang, Qing Shui had a strong feeling that she would undergo a great change as a result of her sister’s death, even to the point of directly leaping to the next realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the thought of this, Qing Shui really wanted to quickly return, It that was the case, then Qing Shui would rather she stayed at the Xiantian realm forever…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kneaded his temples and he continued to watch the three people who were obstructing him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui advanced another 30 meters, looking at Huang Qing. She was standing in the middle, it appeared that she was the one leading them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hello, we meet again!” Huang Qing changed her expression from a frown to a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, this meeting caused Qing Shui to frown, looking at Huang Qing: “It’s not good to see you, I would rather we don’t meet.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui replied impolitely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You really hate seeing me?” Huang Qing said, still smiling at Qing Shui, looking at the man who was becoming more and more mysterious. The last time they met was two years ago. The amount of changes that he had went through was truly unbelievable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had matured, his face had a look of strength and decisiveness, as well as confidence and calm, an appearance of one who had control of everything in his hands. Soon, he would be able to soar past the heavens.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Would I like a person who wants to kill me?” Qing Shui said quietly, looking at this very beautiful woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An originally hostile scene had been changed into a strange one under the words of Huang Qing. The two old men just stood behind with their eyes closed, as though they could not see or hear anything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You think that I will kill you.” Huang Qing’s words did not sound like they were a question but more like a statement.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are Sword Tower’s guardian, doesn’t the fact that you are standing here today signify that?” Qing Shui sat on the Overlord Storm, after a long period of anxiousness, he had finally calmed down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword Demon Huang Qing sighed: “do you know that you underestimated too many people!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded his head: “If you, as the Sward Tower’s guardian, already have this level of strength, then the strongest of Sword Tower, even if he is not a Martial Saint, he would have already cultivated to a terrifying level. I wonder if my deduction is right?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw the strength of Huang Qing and thought about the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, feeling as if he was just at the tip of the iceberg, even if the Greencloud Continent had no Martial Saints, but they would have people who had cultivated for a long time, after all these years, their strength should not only be at the strength of six countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor had hidden his power, now Qing Shui saw that the guardian of Sword Tower was also this strong, the other two old men had more than the strength of six countries, Qing Shui now knew that he can just came into an initial contact with the upper echelons in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It is good that you can think this way, things are very different now, I feel that I can no longer see through you, make your move!” Huang Qing took half a step forward and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This day still came, even though Qing Shui thought that this would happen, but he did not expect it to arrive so soon. He thought he would only meet her when he set out to destroy Sword Tower.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was actually this early!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was their second time meeting, as well as their second time fighting.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not dare to be careless, he took the Violet Gold Divine Shield and held the Big Dipper Sword. Qing Shui did not know when the two old men make a move, but he was not too worried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even after sticking on those talismans on himself and holding the Binding Talisman and Armor Break Talisman in his hands, he frowned at Huang Qing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing watched Qing Shui without making a single move, the meter long sword in her hands was hanging low, her hair and plain clothers were blown around by the wind, causing her to look as indiscernible as an immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He cannot go easy on his enemies, regardless of who it was!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Sui activated his biggest gain from the Flowerfruit Mountain! The Qi in his body circled to an extreme, with the breaking through of the Heavenly Dan and the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui’s body had the strength of 21.5 million Jin and his defense abilities had the strength of 31.5 million Jin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Charge!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui commanded the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to charge towards Huang Qing, the Big Dipper Sword in his hands pierced out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s complexion changed instantly, especially after Qing Shui used the Emperor's Qi. She knitted her pretty eyebrows and at the same time her body emitted a soft glow, akin to moonlight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Receiving Qing Shui’s blow, her body moved agilely and there was a bright sword flash.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ding!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A clear sword cry resounded!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel that strong spiral strength circulating!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This spiral strength cause Qing Shui to feel like he lost 20 percent of his strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, that was it, Qing Shui’s body had the strength of 21.5 million Jin of strength, with the Nature Energy, it added 20 percent to all his abilities, including strength, defense speed, and others.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Frenzied Bull's Strength and Golden-Ringed Battle Armor added 70 percent to his strength and some other insignificant effects.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">30 percent of strength from the Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">50 percent strength increase from the Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">50 percent strength increase from the Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">70 percent increase from the Violet Gold Divine Shield, and when attacking with the shield, there was an extra increase of 20 percent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Surging Blood increased Frenzied Bull's Strength by 10 percent, increasing his strength by 10 percent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">30 percent increase of strength from the Godly Force Talisman, 30 percent increase of defence from the Divine Shield Talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With all these, Qing Shui’s strength has reached a terrifying strength of 9 and a half countries, and this was without the Men Elephant Unison, even after the 20 percent decrease effects from Huang Qing, he still had about the strength of 9 countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unless Huang Qing had other strengthening items on her, with her strength of seven countries, she would not be able to withstand it. Furthermore, her overall abilities had also been weakened by 20 percent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Not just strength, but defense, speed…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not budge, instead Huang Qing staggered backward, her retreat seems pitiable but had a half swirl to it, each step left a footprint on the ground, half a foot deep.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She retreated back five steps and there was some blood leaking from the corner from her mouth!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt bitter in his heart!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why did she do that? Using the strength of five countries to go against my strength of nine countries, isn’t this looking for death?” If Qing Shui did not hold back, and if she didn’t use that strange footwork, her life would be in danger, even as it is, she was still injured.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not press on, Huang Qing just smiled lightly at Qing Shui, the blood at the corner of her mouth and her smile on her face made like looked more seductive, making her temperament seemdifferent from her charms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why did you hold back?” Huang Qing looked at Qing Shui, speaking gently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you playing around with your life? Just count this as payment for you holding back the last time.” Qing Shui avoided her gaze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Will you kill me today?” Huang Qing still continues to smile at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not understand why, this was only the second time they met, every meeting was in a battle, why was this woman acted so familiar with him?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would not believe, even if he was beaten to death, that she fell in love with him at first sight. If she was such a woman, she would have long been taken by another man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thus Qing Shui did not even consider that angle, he just did not know why she was doing this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will, stop playing around with your life.” Qing Shui raised the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You don’t wish for me to die!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing looked at Qing Shui, the twinkle in her eyes growing stronger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This sentence stunned Qing Shui. Did he want her to die? Qing Shui felt at a loss, it was not easy to viciously destroy something beautiful, this was the only advantage that this beautiful girl had.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui leaped suddenly, once again pierced towards Huang Qing, in a more imposing manner than earlier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sword edge pierced into Huang Qing’s chest, penetrating in by 3 inches…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though Huang Qing had an extremely ample chest, if the sword penetrated any deeper, she would die. Fresh blood stained her plain clothes</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why don’t you pierce a little deeper!” Huang Qing looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly withdrew his sword: “What are you trying to do?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I just want to tell you, the Tan Clan already went to the Central Continent to invite the people from Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, you should leave as soon as you can.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then you are……” Qing Shui asked in surprise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Here to delay you, until the people from Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord arrived.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord? Central Continent?” Qing Shui felt his scalp go numb, did he really have to step into the other continents so early?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Guardian Lin, whom you killed, came from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that Guardian Lin was the senior brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, that means that the Misty Hall Palace Mistress was someone from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Quickly go! There is no time left.” Huang Qin looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you doing this……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This way no one will blame me for letting you go.” Huang Qing checked out her bleeding wound.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly felt his whole world changed, he still looked towards Huang Qing in confusion, as though he was trying to figure out something.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you not afraid that I would have killed you?” Qing Shui frowned and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It does not matter, regardless of the results, I would be happy.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s answer caused Qing Shui to be confused!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You… you…..like … me?” Qing Shui found himself asking in disbelief.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Puchi!” Huang Qing actually giggled!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The current you, is not able to make me like you, maybe in future, I would, but right now it is impossible between us.” Huang Qing laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was even more confused!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The honored sir is right in front!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, there was an abrupt sound!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hurry, they are here!” Huang Qing anxiously said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s too late!” Qing Shui smiled bitterly, as he watched a huge eagle fly towards him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fly?&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui watched in shock as that person flew over.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Honored sir?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only people in the Martial Saint realm will be addressed as such in the Central Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s keen eyes stared at the arriving ten people, in front was a tall powerful man, this man looked to be about 50, he was even bigger in stature than that man from the Demon Beast Sect, thick eyebrows encircled his eyes, his facial hair looked like a lion’s mane. He was wearing violet robes and at his waist was a jasper belt that had a width of a palm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed behind the crowd, there were three people from Sword Tower, Tan Yang’s grandfather and an old man dressed in Sword Tower’s uniform. Although Qing Shui did not know his identity, he could feel his strength and could guess his status.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Earlier, Qing Shui heard Huang Qing say that Sword Tower went to invite the help of the people from the Central Continent’s Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. Now that they have come they even brought a Martial Saint and even the Old Ancestor had to personally accompany them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only, it was too soon!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui did not know that Sword Tower already sent the message more than a month ago and that they even used a strange beast from the Central Continent. This beast specialize in sending messages, it was a ‘Shadow Feather,’ it’s speed was strangely fast, its wingspan was just a meter, but it had great speed and endurance, it was mostly used for sending messages between continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every continent would have a ‘Shadow Feather Station,’ in the Central Continent, there is a business that specialized in this, helping people to send messages to earn money, thus even though they were fast, they still took some time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, there were eight people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, aside from the Martial Saint, the rest looked to be able-bodied men in their 30s or 40s, their presence was very much inferior to the man in front.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since that man appeared, Qing Shui could feel that the matured yet handsome man was very resplendent, as though there countless halos around.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Honored sir, this is the one who killed Guardian Lin.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing! Why are you here? This guy injured you?” that man was pleasantly surprised at seeing Huang Qing, but he frowned at Qing Shui when he noticed her injuries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like as though he was tied up when that man glared at him, but the Emperor's Qi and Nature Energy negated some of that pressure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing? Wasn’t she called Huang Qing?” Qing Shui was stunned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Tian!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This fellow killed Chen`er, and even injured you!” the man said quietly, not in anger but causing the surroundings to feel a great pressure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Tian, it is not his fault, senior brother died while trying to kill him.” Huang Qing hurriedly explained.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man from the Tan Clan wanted to open his mouth when was he was stopped by another smiling old man, the old man from the Tan Clan wiped the cold sweat off his head and grateful nodded his head at the earlier old man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s words shifted the hate from Sword Tower to Qing Shui, it did not matter that she was trying to help Qing Shui to explain. How could the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord allow their own to be killed by others? In front of strength, logic no longer applies.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t care about all these, I only know that he must die!” The man stared at Qing Shui. His voice was soft and his tone was determined.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 507 - Injuring Huang Qing, Martial Saint of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord appears</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Could it be that if the women from the Portraits of Beauty were not people who would help him, then they would be a big obstacle to him…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui was not feeling very comfortable, Qing Shui was suddenly very worried about Wenren Wu-shuang, she was of one woman from the Portraits of Beauty. He was afraid of the changes in personality, there was a connection between him and her sister’s death, if she filled herself with hate, she might walk an extreme path, possibly becoming like Sword Demon Huang Qing, who was in front of him…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, who had improved tremendously, found out that Huang Qing actually had a terrifying level of strength, Qing Shu felt that there must be something on her that amplified her growth rate. Furthermore, with that extraordinary longsword in her hands, she should be even more terrifying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Why did she not kill him the last time? Qing Shui was confused for a moment. Could he defeat her today? Could it be that only one of them can walk out alive today?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that these Divine Bodies of the Portraits of Beauty all had great abilities, just that there were not awakened yet, Qing Shui now felt that the Misty Hall Palace Mistress would not be inferior to Huang Qing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the abilities of Yiye Jiange had been sealed, this feeling of Qing Shui’s grew stronger as he gained more strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for Wenren Wu-shuang, Qing Shui had a strong feeling that she would undergo a great change as a result of her sister’s death, even to the point of directly leaping to the next realm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the thought of this, Qing Shui really wanted to quickly return, It that was the case, then Qing Shui would rather she stayed at the Xiantian realm forever…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kneaded his temples and he continued to watch the three people who were obstructing him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui advanced another 30 meters, looking at Huang Qing. She was standing in the middle, it appeared that she was the one leading them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hello, we meet again!” Huang Qing changed her expression from a frown to a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, this meeting caused Qing Shui to frown, looking at Huang Qing: “It’s not good to see you, I would rather we don’t meet.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui replied impolitely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You really hate seeing me?” Huang Qing said, still smiling at Qing Shui, looking at the man who was becoming more and more mysterious. The last time they met was two years ago. The amount of changes that he had went through was truly unbelievable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had matured, his face had a look of strength and decisiveness, as well as confidence and calm, an appearance of one who had control of everything in his hands. Soon, he would be able to soar past the heavens.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Would I like a person who wants to kill me?” Qing Shui said quietly, looking at this very beautiful woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An originally hostile scene had been changed into a strange one under the words of Huang Qing. The two old men just stood behind with their eyes closed, as though they could not see or hear anything.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You think that I will kill you.” Huang Qing’s words did not sound like they were a question but more like a statement.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are Sword Tower’s guardian, doesn’t the fact that you are standing here today signify that?” Qing Shui sat on the Overlord Storm, after a long period of anxiousness, he had finally calmed down.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword Demon Huang Qing sighed: “do you know that you underestimated too many people!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded his head: “If you, as the Sward Tower’s guardian, already have this level of strength, then the strongest of Sword Tower, even if he is not a Martial Saint, he would have already cultivated to a terrifying level. I wonder if my deduction is right?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw the strength of Huang Qing and thought about the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, feeling as if he was just at the tip of the iceberg, even if the Greencloud Continent had no Martial Saints, but they would have people who had cultivated for a long time, after all these years, their strength should not only be at the strength of six countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor had hidden his power, now Qing Shui saw that the guardian of Sword Tower was also this strong, the other two old men had more than the strength of six countries, Qing Shui now knew that he can just came into an initial contact with the upper echelons in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It is good that you can think this way, things are very different now, I feel that I can no longer see through you, make your move!” Huang Qing took half a step forward and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This day still came, even though Qing Shui thought that this would happen, but he did not expect it to arrive so soon. He thought he would only meet her when he set out to destroy Sword Tower.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was actually this early!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was their second time meeting, as well as their second time fighting.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not dare to be careless, he took the Violet Gold Divine Shield and held the Big Dipper Sword. Qing Shui did not know when the two old men make a move, but he was not too worried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even after sticking on those talismans on himself and holding the Binding Talisman and Armor Break Talisman in his hands, he frowned at Huang Qing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing watched Qing Shui without making a single move, the meter long sword in her hands was hanging low, her hair and plain clothers were blown around by the wind, causing her to look as indiscernible as an immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He cannot go easy on his enemies, regardless of who it was!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Sui activated his biggest gain from the Flowerfruit Mountain! The Qi in his body circled to an extreme, with the breaking through of the Heavenly Dan and the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui’s body had the strength of 21.5 million Jin and his defense abilities had the strength of 31.5 million Jin.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Charge!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui commanded the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to charge towards Huang Qing, the Big Dipper Sword in his hands pierced out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s complexion changed instantly, especially after Qing Shui used the Emperor's Qi. She knitted her pretty eyebrows and at the same time her body emitted a soft glow, akin to moonlight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Receiving Qing Shui’s blow, her body moved agilely and there was a bright sword flash.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ding!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A clear sword cry resounded!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel that strong spiral strength circulating!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This spiral strength cause Qing Shui to feel like he lost 20 percent of his strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, that was it, Qing Shui’s body had the strength of 21.5 million Jin of strength, with the Nature Energy, it added 20 percent to all his abilities, including strength, defense speed, and others.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Frenzied Bull's Strength and Golden-Ringed Battle Armor added 70 percent to his strength and some other insignificant effects.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">30 percent of strength from the Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">50 percent strength increase from the Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">50 percent strength increase from the Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">70 percent increase from the Violet Gold Divine Shield, and when attacking with the shield, there was an extra increase of 20 percent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Surging Blood increased Frenzied Bull's Strength by 10 percent, increasing his strength by 10 percent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">30 percent increase of strength from the Godly Force Talisman, 30 percent increase of defence from the Divine Shield Talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With all these, Qing Shui’s strength has reached a terrifying strength of 9 and a half countries, and this was without the Men Elephant Unison, even after the 20 percent decrease effects from Huang Qing, he still had about the strength of 9 countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unless Huang Qing had other strengthening items on her, with her strength of seven countries, she would not be able to withstand it. Furthermore, her overall abilities had also been weakened by 20 percent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Not just strength, but defense, speed…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not budge, instead Huang Qing staggered backward, her retreat seems pitiable but had a half swirl to it, each step left a footprint on the ground, half a foot deep.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She retreated back five steps and there was some blood leaking from the corner from her mouth!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt bitter in his heart!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why did she do that? Using the strength of five countries to go against my strength of nine countries, isn’t this looking for death?” If Qing Shui did not hold back, and if she didn’t use that strange footwork, her life would be in danger, even as it is, she was still injured.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not press on, Huang Qing just smiled lightly at Qing Shui, the blood at the corner of her mouth and her smile on her face made like looked more seductive, making her temperament seemdifferent from her charms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why did you hold back?” Huang Qing looked at Qing Shui, speaking gently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you playing around with your life? Just count this as payment for you holding back the last time.” Qing Shui avoided her gaze.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Will you kill me today?” Huang Qing still continues to smile at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not understand why, this was only the second time they met, every meeting was in a battle, why was this woman acted so familiar with him?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would not believe, even if he was beaten to death, that she fell in love with him at first sight. If she was such a woman, she would have long been taken by another man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thus Qing Shui did not even consider that angle, he just did not know why she was doing this.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will, stop playing around with your life.” Qing Shui raised the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You don’t wish for me to die!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing looked at Qing Shui, the twinkle in her eyes growing stronger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This sentence stunned Qing Shui. Did he want her to die? Qing Shui felt at a loss, it was not easy to viciously destroy something beautiful, this was the only advantage that this beautiful girl had.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui leaped suddenly, once again pierced towards Huang Qing, in a more imposing manner than earlier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sword edge pierced into Huang Qing’s chest, penetrating in by 3 inches…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though Huang Qing had an extremely ample chest, if the sword penetrated any deeper, she would die. Fresh blood stained her plain clothes</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why don’t you pierce a little deeper!” Huang Qing looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly withdrew his sword: “What are you trying to do?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I just want to tell you, the Tan Clan already went to the Central Continent to invite the people from Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, you should leave as soon as you can.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then you are……” Qing Shui asked in surprise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Here to delay you, until the people from Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord arrived.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord? Central Continent?” Qing Shui felt his scalp go numb, did he really have to step into the other continents so early?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Guardian Lin, whom you killed, came from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that Guardian Lin was the senior brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, that means that the Misty Hall Palace Mistress was someone from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Quickly go! There is no time left.” Huang Qin looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you doing this……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This way no one will blame me for letting you go.” Huang Qing checked out her bleeding wound.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly felt his whole world changed, he still looked towards Huang Qing in confusion, as though he was trying to figure out something.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you not afraid that I would have killed you?” Qing Shui frowned and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It does not matter, regardless of the results, I would be happy.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s answer caused Qing Shui to be confused!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You… you…..like … me?” Qing Shui found himself asking in disbelief.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Puchi!” Huang Qing actually giggled!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The current you, is not able to make me like you, maybe in future, I would, but right now it is impossible between us.” Huang Qing laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was even more confused!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The honored sir is right in front!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, there was an abrupt sound!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hurry, they are here!” Huang Qing anxiously said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s too late!” Qing Shui smiled bitterly, as he watched a huge eagle fly towards him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fly?&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui watched in shock as that person flew over.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Honored sir?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only people in the Martial Saint realm will be addressed as such in the Central Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s keen eyes stared at the arriving ten people, in front was a tall powerful man, this man looked to be about 50, he was even bigger in stature than that man from the Demon Beast Sect, thick eyebrows encircled his eyes, his facial hair looked like a lion’s mane. He was wearing violet robes and at his waist was a jasper belt that had a width of a palm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed behind the crowd, there were three people from Sword Tower, Tan Yang’s grandfather and an old man dressed in Sword Tower’s uniform. Although Qing Shui did not know his identity, he could feel his strength and could guess his status.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Earlier, Qing Shui heard Huang Qing say that Sword Tower went to invite the help of the people from the Central Continent’s Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. Now that they have come they even brought a Martial Saint and even the Old Ancestor had to personally accompany them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only, it was too soon!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui did not know that Sword Tower already sent the message more than a month ago and that they even used a strange beast from the Central Continent. This beast specialize in sending messages, it was a ‘Shadow Feather,’ it’s speed was strangely fast, its wingspan was just a meter, but it had great speed and endurance, it was mostly used for sending messages between continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every continent would have a ‘Shadow Feather Station,’ in the Central Continent, there is a business that specialized in this, helping people to send messages to earn money, thus even though they were fast, they still took some time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, there were eight people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, aside from the Martial Saint, the rest looked to be able-bodied men in their 30s or 40s, their presence was very much inferior to the man in front.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since that man appeared, Qing Shui could feel that the matured yet handsome man was very resplendent, as though there countless halos around.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Honored sir, this is the one who killed Guardian Lin.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing! Why are you here? This guy injured you?” that man was pleasantly surprised at seeing Huang Qing, but he frowned at Qing Shui when he noticed her injuries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like as though he was tied up when that man glared at him, but the Emperor's Qi and Nature Energy negated some of that pressure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing? Wasn’t she called Huang Qing?” Qing Shui was stunned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Tian!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This fellow killed Chen`er, and even injured you!” the man said quietly, not in anger but causing the surroundings to feel a great pressure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Tian, it is not his fault, senior brother died while trying to kill him.” Huang Qing hurriedly explained.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man from the Tan Clan wanted to open his mouth when was he was stopped by another smiling old man, the old man from the Tan Clan wiped the cold sweat off his head and grateful nodded his head at the earlier old man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s words shifted the hate from Sword Tower to Qing Shui, it did not matter that she was trying to help Qing Shui to explain. How could the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord allow their own to be killed by others? In front of strength, logic no longer applies.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I don’t care about all these, I only know that he must die!” The man stared at Qing Shui. His voice was soft and his tone was determined.</p>
