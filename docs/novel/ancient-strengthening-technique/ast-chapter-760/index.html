 <p><strong>AST 760 - Duel with Donggong Taiqing three days later</strong></p>
 <p>“Moron, why don’t we have a duel of our own then!” At this moment, Qing Shui said as he stepped to the side of Ye Guyan, smiling towards Donggong Taiqing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s sentence caused everyone to be stunned. Ye Guyan looked at Qing Shui in confusion. Although she was not that familiar with Qing Shui yet, she felt that he was not a rash and impulsive person. However, just today itself, this was already the second time. Furthermore, each time was sufficient for Donggong Taiqing to want to kill him. Why is he doing this?</p>
 <p>This sentence of Qing Shui had also infuriated Donggong Taiqing. His complexion turned scarlet and his hair became loose and messy, the result of him turning extremely angry.</p>
 <p>Although the strength of a lower leveled cultivator would not be able to cause any change in the emotions of the higher leveled cultivator, it was still possible to infuriate the higher leveled cultivator to death. Taking the present for example, Donggong Taiqing could no longer maintain his calm. No one had ever scolded him before, it had always been him scolding others.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui……” Ye Guyan shouted at Qing Shui. At this moment, she was very perplexed.</p>
 <p>Earlier, she had already felt that this situation was problematic but it was still possible for her to smooth things over. However, things had now progressed to an irreconcilable level.</p>
 <p>“Alright, you reckless fool. I shall accept this challenge. When and where?” Donggong Taiqing was so infuriated that his expression turned into a sinister smile.</p>
 <p>“Three days later, late in the morning. We shall hold it there.” Qing Shui pointed to a huge arena not far away from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I accept. I shall let you live for two more days.” Donggong Taiqing clenched his teeth in anger.</p>
 <p>At this time of day, there were already many people in the surrounding area. The news of Donggong Taiqing dueling with someone was undoubtedly a big piece of news. This news was soon rapidly spread around.</p>
 <p>Duels were sacred. Once a duel had been arranged, no one could stop it or make changes to it unless someone surrenders or the two parties came to another agreement. Thus, Qing Shui’s duel with Donggong Taiqing was something set in stone. Even Ye Guyan could not do anything to stop it. Furthermore, there was no other way to settle this problem apart from having the duel.</p>
 <p>In any case, there was no longer any ways to change it either because news of this had already spread. Furthermore, Donggong Taiqing definitely did not have any intention to make any changes. It was already surprising for him to agree to holding it three days later. Going by his usual personality, he would have just killed Qing Shui on the spot.</p>
 <p>Gongxi Hao currently felt very guilty. Today’s matter happened as a result of him. The first time, it was so. On the second time, it was still so. At this moment, he felt that he was really useless…...</p>
 <p>Donggong Taiqing was currently looking playfully at Qing Shui and the others. His expression was disdainful as he turned around to head back to the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan, laughing frivolous as he left.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, why are you doing this?” Ye Guyan sighed gently.</p>
 <p>“I could not stand his arrogant manners. He went too far in bullying others.” Qing Shui said angrily. Although this kind of person would not cause Qing Shui to be too angry, he was very hateful. The most important thing was that this was someone he would kill sooner or later. This was an opportunity that was hard to come by.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not expect that he would bump into Donggong Taiqing on the second day after he arrived at the Ye Clan and when he had just came out to take a look.. It was truly coincidental. Although he had already been in the Southern Viewing Continent for quite a long time, he had only been in Southern Sea City for just one day.</p>
 <p>“Is that truly the reason?” Ye Guyan looked suspiciously at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Of course. I was too rash and caused trouble for you all.”</p>
 <p>What a joke. It was impossible for Qing Shui to speak of the true reason. The time was not right yet. Furthermore, there was no need to speak of it.</p>
 <p>“You did not cause any trouble from us. However, what are you going to do about the duel three days later?” Ye Guyan’s emotions were in turmoil. He had saved her sister and she owed him a debt of gratitude. Today’s matter supposedly had nothing to do with him but yet…...</p>
 <p>“Brother, I let you down.” Gongxi Hao struck his own head with his hands in remorse.</p>
 <p>“Brother Hao, we are brothers. What is the meaning of this? If I were you, when I meet such a situation, would you just stand by the side and watch?” Qing Shui grabbed Gongxi Hao’s wrist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not feel guilty about saying this at all. Although he had a grudge with the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan, even without it, he would have done the same. Donggang Taiqing kept humiliating him from the very start. This kind of person ought to be killed.</p>
 <p>Gongxi Hao was now quite different from his earlier high-spirited self. Qing Shui could understand this. This was normal after meeting a person like Donggong Taiqing and having to humble himself for the sake of survival, even to the point of not showing any signs of his anger.</p>
 <p>“Miss Ye, let’s keep going. We have only walked for a short while, if we don’t keep moving, it would be impossible to finish by today.” Qing Shui smiled at Ye Guyan.</p>
 <p>Although Ye Guyan was unable to see through Qing Shui’s strength, she felt that it was impossible for Qing Shui to triumph over Donggong Taiqing. Furthermore, there were still other people in the Eastern Palace Clan. Not to even mention defeating Donggong Taiqing, even if he managed to do so, there was no way he would be able to carry on living.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan understood the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan well. Qing Shui would not have a good end. Even if he tried to flee, he would not be able to make it far. She felt turmoil in her heart but she did not know what to do.</p>
 <p>“Stop thinking too much, it will be fine.” Qing Shui gently consoled Ye Guyan.</p>
 <p>Ye Yan stood at the side and frowned, looking apologetically at Qing Shui: “I have harmed Uncle.”</p>
 <p>She felt that if she did not meet Qing Shui, he would not have come to Southern Sea City and met Donggong Taiqing. Thus, this conflict that led to the duel would not have happened.</p>
 <p>“Yan`er, all of you are not to blame. This is my matter.” Qing Shui said ambiguously.</p>
 <p>The more he behaved like this, the more the others felt upset. Finally, Ye Guyan told Gongxi Hao, “You should go back first. let me handle this.”</p>
 <p>“Guyan……”</p>
 <p>“Go back.” Ye Guyan said gently.</p>
 <p>Gongxi Hao bit his lips before turning to look at Qing Shui apologetically, “I will come and find you later.” After saying that, he turned to leave, bringing his people with him.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, let’s go back and discuss what to do next.” Ye Yan was almost in tears.</p>
 <p>“That’s fine too!” Qing Shui could only smile and reply. He had seen Ye Yan’s expression and also noticed that Ye Guyan did not have the mood to continue touring around.</p>
 <p>“Hai, I don’t know what to say about you. Are you bold and powerful or are you just an ignorant idiot?” As they walked, Ye Guyan said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Which would you prefer?” Qing Shui smiled gently at Ye Guyan.</p>
 <p>“Of course I hope that you are bold and powerful.” Ye Guyan gave Qing Shui an irritated look. Actually, she was a little angry at Qing Shui. Today’s matter could have been resolved just by keeping quiet and enduring it. There were many people who just endured the Eastern Palace Clan. It would not be strange if they did so too.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, based on Donggong Taiqing’s attitude, he could tell that the Eastern Palace Clan did not have much good relations with people. While they might have some scoundrels as friends, Qing Shui was not afraid of them. The helpers of the Eastern Palace Clan would definitely not be as strong as the Eastern Palace Clan.</p>
 <p>Thus, the problem of eradicating the Eastern Palace Clan would be resolved. Qing Shui decided to start with today’s matter. He hoped that it would go smoothly.</p>
 <p>When he returned the the Ye Clan, they ran into Cang Wuya and the others. They saw the sullen expression of Ye Guyan as well as the bitter expression of Ye Yan.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui’s expressions did not seem to be changed. Cang Wuya puzzledly looked at Qing Shui, “What’s wrong? What happened?”</p>
 <p>“Three days later, I will be having a duel with Donggong Taiqing at Martial God Street.”</p>
 <p>Although his voice was not loud, a few of the Ye Clan passersby heard it, causing them to stop in their tracks, feeling shocked and at a complete loss.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji were also instantly stunned. Although they knew that Qing Shui wanted to fight against the Eastern Palace Clan, they did not expect him to take action so fast…...</p>
 <p>Bai Gui was still very calm. He cultivated the way of assassination, which required him to have a strong heart. He would not be shocked easily and had strong endurance and acceptance abilities.</p>
 <p>As the few of them spoke, they headed to the great hall!</p>
 <p>“Yan`er, please go and get Grandpa Crazy.” Ye Guyan stopped and told Ye Yan.</p>
 <p>Ye Yan stared blankly for a moment before leaving.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw Ye Guyan’s distressed looks and felt a warmth in his heart. Regardless, she was worrying because of his problems.</p>
 <p>“Miss Ye, I have already said, you don't have to worry about this.” Qing Shui said seriously to Ye Guyan.</p>
 <p>“I really wish to not worry for you. However, currently I feel that it would be an extravagant hope to wish that I don’t have to worry about you” Ye Guyan looked at Qing Shui and shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Then what does Miss Ye intend to do?” Qing Shui asked out of curiosity.</p>
 <p>“I said before that I would not let anything happen to you. I intend for you to break your promise.” Ye Guyan said with a lonely expression after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Break my promise? How? Although this is the first time i ment Donggong Taiqing, I know that he would not let me off.” Qing Shui looked at Ye Guyan and said.</p>
 <p>“Actually, he has a motive in doing this. Once he achieved his motive, he would definitely let us off.” Ye Guyan frowned slightly.</p>
 <p>“Motive? Something to do with you?” Qing Shui looked at Ye Guyan in confusion as he asked.</p>
 <p>“Donggong Taiqing has always wanted me to marry him. If I agree to it, he would forget about the matter between you and him. However, it is best that you quickly leave. Don’t stay here any longer.” Ye Guyan hesitated for a moment before saying, as though she had been struggling with this decision.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was shocked. Could it be that she intend to wrong herself for him? She did say that she would not let anything happen to him but he never expected that she would go this far.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui felt very guilty. However, everything was fine. Regardless of the situation, he would not let this happen. He smiled gently at Ye Guyan: “I would rather choose to die than to let you marry that kind of man so that I can live.”</p>
 <p>“I am not doing this for you, so you don't have to feel guilty. This is for my beliefs. You rescued my sister, I owe you for that. Now that you are in a tight spot, I would naturally have to help you, regardless of the price.” Ye Guyan shook her head and said.</p>
 <p>“What if I said that my purpose in coming to Southern Sea City is to eradicate the Eastern Palace Clan. Would you believe me?” Qing Shui said after they took a seat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now knew that there was no more point in concealing this. Things have now come to a point where he should reveal it. There was no need for Ye Guyan to carry such a huge and heavy burden.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan stared blankly for awhile before shaking her head at Qing Shui, “If you had said that at the very start, I might have believed you. Even when you suggested that duel, I was suspecting so. However, I do not believe you now.” Ye Guyan continued to shake her head as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
