 <p><strong>AST 1266 - Desolate Sect, The Man By the Surname Lü Who Was Killed</strong></p>
 <p>The two of them continued to chat until the sky turned dark. It was then did Qing Shui asked Di Chen: "Where shall we settle down today?"</p>
 <p>"Where were you previously?" Di Chen laid in Qing Shui arms and said.</p>
 <p>"I was initially at the Heaven Secrets Academy but I have come to look for you. I didn't have a permanent residence now either. Why don't we just find an inn in the Imperial City for the night." Qing Shui said that he was going to the Diwu Clan, and thus he planned to first head to the Diwu Clan to take a look.</p>
 <p>"Alright, I'll go with what you say."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Chen took the Blue Luan and flew to the vicinity of the Hu Clan. They then found themselves a quite nice inn to stay.</p>
 <p>The rooms here were in a complete set, with living room, bedrooms and stuff. Most of them would have two bedrooms. The inn did not care if the guests were to stay in either only one or two rooms. The staff members from the inn were stunned by Di Chen's beauty and many of their gaze unknowingly froze when they saw her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui exuded a slight trembling aura to wake them up. These people then withdrew their gazes in a shock. It wouldn't be worth it if they ended up being killed instantly by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Oh, what a great aura. To think that you dare to act so brazenly here."</p>
 <p>What surprised Qing Shui was that someone actually stood out. He turned to look in the direction of the voice. In the hall, there were a few men who wore brightly colored clothes and exuded a mysterious aura.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned. He had thought that it was someone from the Royal Clan in the Divine Might Dynasty. But right now, he now thought otherwise. He had came into contact with Furong before and felt that the dignified aura these people exuded were unlike that of the members of the royalty.</p>
 <p>"You guys are from the Desolate Sect?" Before Qing Shui could say anything, Di Chen frowned and said to them.</p>
 <p>"The beauty has a discerning eye., to think that you know who we are. Since you know about us, come join us brothers for a drink." One of the men looked at Di Chen with a gleam of greed in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Di Chen frowned but didn't say anything. Qing Shui spoke up, "To hell with your drinking!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shot out vulgarities from his previous life. Although there wasn't a similar term in this world, it didn't affect the other party's understanding. However, before the other party could react, Qing Shui slapped out across space.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that these people were strong, but there were only strong and not up to the strength of 1,000 suns. One who was at a strength of 1,000 suns were already considered to be very strong and thus would tend to use Spiritual Confinement when they attack. Moreover, for someone of Qing Shui's caliber, it was easy for him to beat up someone of their level.</p>
 <p>The crisp slap caused everyone to be stunned, even Di Chen. However, she quickly regained her composure and stood next to Qing Shui without saying a word.</p>
 <p>"How dare you raise your hands against us! If I don't kill your entire family, my surname won't be Lü!" The face of the man who had been slapped had already swelled up to be like that of a pig. It was also flushed red from the hit and was a terrible sight.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's gaze turned cold and with a flash, he turned a fist shadow into a physical punch, launching it out toward the person who was still threatening him loudly.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>The man's head exploded, causing the surroundings to turned dead silent. Even the people who were with the man who was just killed looked at him in disbelief before they turned to look at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't killing unnecessarily. He didn't like to be threatened. Moreover, so what if he were to kill someone like this? If a cultivator were to be scared and shrinked back over every little thing, it would be very hard for the person to improve.</p>
 <p>Di Chen also looked at Qing Shui with a complicated gaze.</p>
 <p>"I'm not interested in killing more people today. Scram. Remember, one will die easily if he doesn't have a brain." Qing Shui said without a care.</p>
 <p>The other few clenched their teeth and rapidly disappeared together with their dead companion.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui headed up with Di Chen. They had already asked for a room earlier.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you're in trouble." The moment they reached the room, Di Chen said and looked at Qing Shui as she smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>"You're referring to the few men from earlier? Is the Desolate Sect at the Desolate Mountain Regions?" Qing Shui looked at Di Chen and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Do you know about the Desolate Sect?" Di Chen looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"I don't. Could it be more powerful that the Divine Might Dynasty or the Lotus Sect?" Qing Shui gave it some thought before asking.</p>
 <p>"On the surface, the two Grade Four Dynasties and the Heaven Secrets Academy are the strongest. However, this is just the superficial appearance. For example, the Lotus Sect and the Southern Sea's Putuo Mountain are both not weaker than Grade Four. It's just that they've kept themselves concealed. There are many influences in this world which aren't willing to reveal themselves. Showing off one's trump card aren't just accompanied with advantages. If the person were to be targeted, it could be a lethal blow." Di Chen smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Putuo Mountain is so powerful as well?" Qing Shui was very surprised. He hadn't expected that Tantai Xuan's sect was so powerful.</p>
 <p>"This isn't just it. There are actually quite a few more powerful influences. On the surface, they might not appear to be very strong, but in reality, no one knows how powerful they are. However, everyone knows that they are strong. This is an open secret."</p>
 <p>"Then what's the Desolate Sect like?" Qing Shui’s curiosity increased.</p>
 <p>“What we have control over is but half of the Western Oxhe Continent. The other half starts from the Desolate Mountain Regions and is even more dangerous. It's rumored that there are powerful sects and aristocratic clans there and that the area is very prosperous. The only thing is that it's too dangerous. The Desolate Sect is a sect in the Desolate Mountain Regions which is close to us and is a powerful sect."</p>
 <p>"How powerful are they?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know, but I know that they are no weaker than the Lotus Sect and the Divine Might Dynasty. It's even rumored that they are slightly stronger than the Lotus Sect and the Divine Might Dynasty." Di Chen shared everything that she knew.</p>
 <p>"You're the Lotus Sect's Holy Maiden. These ignorant fools are just unlucky if they get killed. Could the Lotus Sect be scared of the Desolate Sect?" Qing Shui smiled, not paying it too much heed.</p>
 <p>"I'm not afraid. But I'm feeling a bit uneasy because you've killed the guy whose surname is Lü. The surname Lü is the most influential one in the Desolate Sect. I'm afraid that after those guys return, more people from the Desolate Sect would come to look for trouble." Di Chen looked at Qing Shui a little uneasily.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry. If they come, I'll fight. If I can't beat them, then I'll run. Come, I'll give you some things to raise your abilities. When the time comes, we'll beat them up and send them back to the Desolate Sect, or we shall beat them up all the way to the Desolate Sect." Qing Shui first took out the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring that he had prepared for her all these time. He pricked one of her fingers with a gold needle and then let the ring recognize its owner.</p>
 <p>The Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring was still considered as a small divine artifact which could be used as a life-saving tool for their level.</p>
 <p>Next were the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl and other stuff. He even saved a Swift Agile Pill which he had refined successfully. However before that, Qing Shui applied acupuncture on her. When everything ended, it was going to be daybreak soon.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked at her current abilities with a slight bit of disbelief. Right now, her abilities were about 3,000 suns and was considered to be extremely powerful. It would also increase a lot in the future.</p>
 <p>"Chen`er, actually, if we were to go through Duo Cultivation, you'll definitely be able to attain a breakthrough and gained a lot more power." Qing Shui attempted to tempt her.</p>
 <p>"I'm feeling a little overloaded as it is. In the short term, it'll be very hard to improve any further. You rascal, only thinking of these things all the time." Di Chen knocked on Qing Shui’s head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled awkwardly and then pulled Di Chen's hand. "Let's go pay a visit to the Hu Clan first and then head to Miss Diwu's place. If it wasn't for her, I'll probably be unable to find you."</p>
 <p>Di Chen knew Diwu Zhisha and Hu Yiqian as well. After all, Hu Yiqian and Diwu Zhisha were on quite good terms. They stayed at the Hu Clan until noon before they headed towards the Diwu Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had treated Diwu Zhisha and was now considered as the Diwu Clan's benefactor. This time around, when they headed to the Diwu Clan, some of the elders in the clan came out to express their thanks personally.</p>
 <p>With Qing Shui's current abilities, in addition to the fact that he had helped the Diwu Clan, he felt very at ease when he met some of their people. After all, when one had power, one would always be greatly respected no matter where he was.</p>
 <p>It was all the more so for Di Chen's case. She was the Lotus Sect's Holy Maiden and this status alone was definitely very powerful. The Lotus Sect was equally powerful when compared to the Divine Might Dynasty. Moreover, if there were no accidents, the Lotus Sect's Holy Maiden would be the one to take over the position of the sect lord in the future.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui and Di Chen had the rights to be treated as such. However, with Diwu Zhisha around, Qing Shui and Di Chen both acted very politely and addressed themselves as juniors.</p>
 <p>The Diwu Clan didn't dare to be treated with such great courtesy. However, it would reflect well for both parties.</p>
 <p>After the greetings, the people who took part in the banquet were all the direct descendants of the faction Diwu Zhisha was in. After the banquet was on for some time, about one hour later, the others departed in turns and left Qing Shui, Di Chen, and Diwu Zhisha.</p>
 <p>"What are you guys planning to do?" Diwu Zhisha looked at Qing Shui and Di Chen with a strange look. She knew that the Lotus Sect had a stringent restriction on the Holy Maiden.</p>
 <p>"After the new year, I'll bring Chen`er to visit the Lotus Sect's sect lord. If there's no room for discussions, I'll take Chen`er with me and leave." Qing Shui said with great ease.</p>
 <p>"You really don't hold any regard for the Lotus Sect. They won't let you take the Lotus Sect's Holy Maiden with you." Diwu Zhisha said straight to the point.</p>
 <p>"I'll take her with me and beat up whoever dares to stop me." Qing Shui said causally.</p>
 <p>"Sigh, Elder Sister Chen, what about you? What are you planning to do?" Diwu Zhisha looked toward Di Chen.</p>
 <p>"He has been searching for me for eight years. I don't know how it has been for him all this while, and therefore this time around, I'll stand together with him." Di Chen smiled casually and said.</p>
 <p>Diwu Zhisha now felt that the world was a little crazy and beyond her understanding. She let out a sigh helplessly. "What should I do? Should I stand against the Lotus Sect with the two of you?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Chen were slightly taken aback. Di Chen quickly said, "Don't do something foolish. Even if Qing Shui doesn't come, I'll leave the Lotus Sect one day. You just stay as it is, it'll be even better if you can replace me."</p>
 <p>"My life was saved by Qing Shui. Do you think that I have a choice?" Diwu Zhisha said helplessly.</p>
 <p>"You have the Diwu Clan behind you. Your sentiments are sufficient. There's no need for you to worry for us. I have confidence." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"No!"</p>
 <p>"If you were to insist, do you believe that I can make you return to your previous condition?" Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>"I'd rather you let me return to how I was previously. It'd be easier for me to make my decision!"</p>
 <p>"Foolish girl, stop creating more trouble here. There's no need to worry, I'm capable of handling this. Otherwise, if you were to get into trouble, how would Chen`er and I leave when the time comes?" Qing Shui said seriously this time around.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Diwu Zhisha agreed. Qing Shui hadn't expected that after he found Di Chen, the Lotus Sect would be a great trouble. Right now, he didn't know how to handle the situation. It was clearly not suitable for him to just kill. He could only just wait till he had met the Lotus Sect's sect lord.</p>
 <p>Another problem was the Desolate Sect. In the time to follow, Qing Shui wouldn't have any time to relax. Well, it was good since he wasn't planning to leave the Western Oxhe Continent anytime soon either. He still had to manage the matters here and in the five continents. He hope that within the next three years, he would be able to attain another breakthrough.</p>
