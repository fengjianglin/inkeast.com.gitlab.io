 <p><strong>Chapter 92 Wenren Wu-Shuang in Trouble.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0092 – Wenren Wu-Shuang in Trouble</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that depending solely on his own strength to concoct the Xiantian Golden Pellet was a fool’s dream. It was even tougher than depending on his own strength to break through. Some of the materials required were from demonic beasts at the Xiantian level. How could he manage to obtain those necessary materials before he even reached the Xiantian realm?</p>
  <p>Furthermore, even if he was at Xiantian, how could it be so easy to hunt a Xiantian-level demonic beast? Previously in Hundred Miles City, there were three humans at the peak of Houtian as well as a Xiantian-level master who went hunting for a Xiantian-level Iron-Armored Demonic Bear. In the end, only the Xiantian-level master survived with half his life left. Not only did he barely survive, but his cultivation base was totally wasted. The three others at the peak of Houtian Realm had died.</p>
  <p>This ex-Xiantian master, was none other than the grandpa of Yu He. It was precisely because his cultivation had been crippled that Yu He became the bride of another family with a Xiantian-level master. What a pity that the groom had such an unfortunate life, and he actually died three days before the wedding, having no chance to enjoy intercourse with Yu He.</p>
  <p>He knew of the existence of the ex-Xiantian master from the mouth of Yu He. Initially, there was some other businesses outside Hundred Miles City that allied themselves with the Yu Clan. But after the fall of the Yu Clan’s Xiantian-level master, other powers soon began to devour these small businesses for their own. In the face of benefits, strength was the only security!</p>
  <p>This incident struck a chord in Qing Shui’s heart. In this cultivation-oriented world, strength was everything. If the Qing Clan had a Xiantian-level master, not to mention the Qing Village, even if they want a share of power inside the Hundred Miles City, it was extremely simple to do so. They could just do like the Wenren sisters had done, before Wu-Shuang had broken into the Xiantian realm, they enjoyed the protection of a Xiantian-level master, setting a place as their base and easily earning money with no fear of external threats.</p>
  <p>The next day, Qing Shui prepared to go to the Night Fragrance Court. After all it had been some time since he had last visited. Their initial agreement was for Qing Shui to visit the Night Fragrance Court once every two days, but because of various occurrences, Qing Shui couldn’t find the time to go there. Over time, Qing Shui started to feel a sense of warmth from going to the place. Everytime he saw Wenren Wu-Shuang, he would smile from the bottom of his heart.</p>
  <p>In this world of the nine continents, Qing Shui had almost close to no friends. After every interaction with Wenren Wu-Shuang, he felt closer and closer to her. In Hundred Miles City, there were only two places which he frequented. One, was the Night Fragrance Court, and the second was the Yu He Inn.</p>
  <p>As for Shi Qingzhuang, he had no contact with her ever since they returned back to the city. However, she was constantly close to his heart. How he wished to see her again.</p>
  <p>When he arrived at the court, he only saw Wenren Wu-Gou. She was still as charming and flirtatious as ever. However, ever since Qing Shui had mastered the Heavenly Vision Technique, he realized that aside from medical conditions, he could also see other things as well. For example, the fluctuations of the heart. Just like right now, Qing Shui could tell that Wenren Wu-Gou was extremely frustrated and filled with worry, even though she looked completely fine on the surface.</p>
  <p>“Where’s Wu-Shuang?” Qing Shui unabashedly referred to Wenren Wu-Shuang by her first name.</p>
  <p>“She has something to do, and won’t be able to practice swordplay with you these next few days.”</p>
  <p>“Is something wrong? Did something happen to Wu-Shuang?” He knew that the two sisters shared a close bond, so how could the source of frustration and worry in Wu-Gou’s heart be unrelated to Wu-Shuang?</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-Gou silently regarded Qing Shui, and upon seeing the clear eyes of Qing Shui which were filled with traces of panic, Wenren Wu-Gou sighed, “Wu-Shuang was poisoned by a demonic beast, and is currently on her way to the Heavenly River City to look for an alchemist to concoct an antidote for her.”</p>
  <p>“Poisoned? By a demonic beast?” Qing Shui furrowed his brows. Considering the strength of Wenren Wu-Shuang, she shouldn’t be affected by any of the poisons of common beasts.</p>
  <p>“It’s poison from the Golden-Ringed Snake King. It’s fortunate that Wu-Shuang escaped quickly, if not, I wouldn’t dare imagine the consequences.” Wenren Wu-Gou replied.</p>
  <p>Golden-Ringed Snake King. Qing Shui knew that this was a Xiantian-level demonic snake. It was extremely massive in size, about 50m long with a width of 1m wide. It had a circular-looking head, and it’s black skin was covered with criss crossing diamond patterns. The head and the tail of the snake was further marked by a golden ring, thereby giving the snake it’s name.</p>
  <p>It possessed an extremely strong poison. The poison was able to numb the target’s senses, and ultimately cause heart failure. Qing Shui didn’t know why, but he was currently seized with an ominous foreboding feeling.</p>
  <p>“Wu-Shuang went to Heavenly River City alone?”</p>
  <p>“Right, don’t worry about it. She possesses medicine to control the poison within her for a month. As long as she can find an alchemist to concoct a Five-Dragon Pellet for her within a month, she would surely be fine.” Wenren Wu-Shuang reassured him. It was as though she had found a support to lean on upon witnessing how distraught Qing Shui was.</p>
  <p>Everyone had their moments of weakness. Qing Shui knew that other than each other, Wenren Wu-Shuang and Wenren Wu-Gou had no other family nor friends. If not, how would they be willing to allow the poisoned Wenren Wu-Shuang to travel alone.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could not said to be extremely proficient with his concoction of medical pills, but he still had some knowledge regarding the Five Dragon Pellet. It was just that he had no way to concoct that now. The only thing he could concoct at the moment, was the Golden Sore Ointment Medicine.</p>
  <p>“Do you have anyway to contact Wu-Shuang?” Qing Shui furrowed his brows, he felt extremely helpless, just like a filthy rich guy dying of starvation. He had no way of utilizing the wealth of information within his sea of consciousness because it was not unlocked!</p>
  <p>“She said that whether she was successful or not in dispelling the poison, she would return in one month.” Wenren Wu-Gou sighed, it was as if the tension had formed a cloud of worry in the air.</p>
  <p>“Give me the address of her destination, I might have a method. I’m worried that Wu-Shuang might not be able to hold on for a month!” Qing Shui remembered reading that if it was poison from an ordinary Golden-Ring Snake, there was no doubt that Xiantian-level masters would be able to suppress it for a month. However, as for the poison by the Golden-Ringed Snake King, even Xiantian-level Masters wouldn’t be able to hold out long against that. They might only be able to control the spread of poison for about half a month to a period of 20 days.”</p>
  <p>As the saying goes, in dire medical situations, all doctors (even fake ones) were welcome. Wenren Wu-Gou revealed the destination of Wu-Shuang with no hesitation. As long as someone dangled the slightest bit of hope in front of her, she would grab the chance and trust that person, no matter the consequences or the price she would have to pay.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, upon seeing the frantic Wenren Wu-Gou giving him the destination of Wu-Shuang with no hesitation, he sighed in his heart, “If I was someone with bad intentions, Wenren Wu-Shuang would surely face trouble!”</p>
  <p>Actually, Qing Shui was wrong. Wenren Wu-Gou had already seen all types of men from all walks of life. How could her 6th sense and judgement be so inferior? She knew that even though Qing Shui was filled with lust, when there was something important that needed to be done, he was someone that she could trust with her life.</p>
