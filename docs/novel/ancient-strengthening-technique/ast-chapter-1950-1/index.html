 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After sending off the Thirteenth Prince and the two old men, it was already halfway through the afternoon. Qing Shui, being unoccupied, went into the realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing the Demon Refining Furnace, he was reminded of the two Azuregold Snakes. Those two little ones were useful things. When Qing Shui saw the both of them, he revealed a smile on his face. However, now was still not the time. He must find them a new owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange’s current strength was very fearsome. It had already reached a sufficient level. Qing Shui also helped boost both of Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing’s strength. Added on that, there was the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda and also their own demonic beasts. They wouldn’t lose to Yiye Jiange in terms of strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Hanye’s strength hadn’t had a significant increase this time, throughout these three years, her strength was already almost on par with Yiye Jiange, who had just broken through. Even the Poison Dragon King’s strength was almost on the level of Seventh Divine Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though in comparison to the other two, Luo Qingcheng and Muyun Qingge were a bit inferior. They were still, however, warriors at Sixth Divine Grade. Furthermore, they each were from the rare Drakaina and Mermaid Tribes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng were starting to catch up in terms of their strength. Qing Shui aided them in achieving the early stages of Seventh Divine Grade, which was already considered to be a praiseworthy feat. Though they were still about a level away from Yiye Jiange and the other girls, the pace at which their strength had improved during these few years became many times faster compared to before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time he came out of the realm, the sun had already set. Qing Shui cleared his head as he left, knowing that he was going to be really occupied for these few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it came to having dinner, everyone had their own meal. After all, there were too many people currently living in the hall. Each of them had their own room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, everyone had already been informed that Qing Hanye was pregnant. This caused Luo Qingcheng to hold even more bitterness toward Qing Shui. Qing Shui and Luo Qingcheng had yet to take their final steps together, but anyone could figure out that there would come a day when she would become his woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge and Qing Shui seemed neither close nor distant. They also hadn’t had any close interactions. As time passed, the two seemed to have even stopped flirting with each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t really care about such matter. Though it was true that Muyun Qingge was an unmatched beauty, Qing Shui had yet to fall for her to the point of no return. Hence, he would rather let it go and let destinies decide everything for them. He wouldn’t force it, nor would he give up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing which Qing Shui was most helpless about was Tantai Lingyan. It could be said that Qing Shui would definitely not give up on this woman. Since back then, on their first meeting with each other, everything had already been decided. Even now, Qing Shui could already tell that she liked him. The only problem with her was that she had yet to be able to go through her own problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong-dong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knocked on Tantai Lingyan’s room’s entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The door opened slowly. What came out of it was an astounding face. From Qing Shui’s perspective, the face lacked a bit of coldness. However, the chilly and exceptional aura was still found lingering in it. It was a kind of aura that was imprinted deep into her bones. It would be very tough to take it away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would always feel a bit pressured when he was in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing, standing out there? Come in.” Seeing that Qing Shui was daydreaming in front of the door, Tantai Lingyan invited him in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and walked in. Tantai Lingyan then closed the door. It was still a bit early and wasn’t the time to have dinner yet. The room, however, looked a bit dim and the Light Stones were already beginning to shine. Light Stones were very unique objects. The darker the sky got, the brighter it would shine. In the morning, it would look no different from an ordinary stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are too beautiful. My soul has left my body just now.” Qing Shui chuckled as he walked into her room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t the first time Qing Shui had entered Tantai Lingyan’s room. Her room looked simple and clean. There was also a mild fragrance floating around it. It was untainted even by a speck of dust. Looking at it as a whole, the entire room looked pure white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan shot him a glare and remained silent. She then sat down on a chair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked to her and sat down beside her. Tantai Lingyan didn’t make any comments as Qing Shui was doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He enjoyed the faint aroma that was lingering around her. This was a kind of fragrance which nothing could compare to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was already used to Qing Shui’s action. He then turned his head to the side to look at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like usual, Qing Shui’s heartbeat would quicken every time he looked into the cold and beautiful eyes of hers. He then tried to leap onto her like a beast only to be stopped by her. She flickered his head with her finger, leaving him to rub his forehead speechlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and grabbed her hand, “I am going to travel to somewhere far away in a few days time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Have a safe journey!” Actually, Tantai Lingyan already knew that a day like this would come. After all, Qing Shui had been staying here for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you not have anything which you would like to tell me?” Qing Shui asked, wanting to hear some parting words from Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you want me to say?” Tantai Lingyan asked with a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Something like… You love me?” Qing Shui boldly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I love you.” Tantai Lingyan said without even a moment of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui opened up his eyes wide, “Can you say it with some emotions? Or else, it will hurt me a lot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How shall I do that?” Tantai Lingyan’s mood seemed to have been lightened up a little. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Say it more affectionately…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know how to do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a bit speechless. Nevertheless, he very quickly put on a smile which Tantai Lingyan was familiar with, “Erm… When will you finally decide to settle down as my woman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have always been.” Tantai Lingyan said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then… Are we considered……?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have told me before to not force myself. You even said that you will wait until I ask you myself…” Talking up to this point, Tantai Lingyan was unable to continue on her sentence and blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, Qing Shui had once told her that he wouldn’t force her and would wait for her to say it herself instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ask for sex yourself… Well, in a way, this is also a great thing. Little Yan Yan, there is one thing that I am very curious about. Considering that you are already such a mature person, how do you solve the problems of your needs?” Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan very seriously. His eyes were filled with lust, as if wanting to swallow her up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn you… I won’t do it on my own. I don’t have any needs when it comes to that…” Tantai Lingyan gave Qing Shui an embarrassed look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s impossible. You understand that feeling more than anyone else. When you finally do it, it will be even more soul-taking. Don’t you want to give it a try? Imagine the scene… And then the numb sensation which can penetrate through your bones…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop!” Tantai Lingyan covered up Qing Shui’s mouth to stop him from continue talking. This naughty brat was trying to seduce her once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her in the past would never give things like this any thought. It was until when Qing Shui’s Gold Needles and hands, which had stimulated some of her acupoints and led her to her peak when she first began having thoughts about this. It was no wonder men and women never got sick of having sex. So much so that at times, some people would never want to stop themselves from being in that feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time she thought about this, she would feel very embarrassed, and it was all thanks to this naughty brat. However, every time when she experienced that urge, she would try to suppress it with her own will. Sometimes, she wouldn’t be able to suppress it completely, leaving her to continuously dwell within the scenes of her first encounter with Qing Shui. Though many years had passed, it was still the only time she had done it. She could never get herself to forget about those memories. Added on that later on, having Qing Shui stimulated certain parts of her acupoints with his hand, She was once again made familiar of those sensations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Little Yan Yan, you have fallen in love.” Qing Shui observed Tantai Lingyan whose aura was a bit unstable and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s words caused Tantai Lingyan’s eyes to become blurry. It made her usual cold-looking face to start looking a bit charming. She was also giving out a kind of fatal attraction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui moved forward and successfully landed his lips on her sexy and wet lips. Tantai Lingyan didn’t struggle. She even got very familiar with this method of kissing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, Qing Shui helped Tantai Lingyan removed all of her upper items of clothing. However, he was stopped when he tried to take off her lower garments. She blushed and whispered, “Don’t do it… Just do like how you did last time……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She spoke with a very soft voice, but Qing Shui still managed to hear it. Like last time, it was precisely the Soul Charming Bone Corrosion Fist which he had used to aid her in reaching her peak.</span></p>
