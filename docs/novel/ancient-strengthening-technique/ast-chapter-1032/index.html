 <p><strong>AST 1032 - Complete Nine Waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palm, Cultivation</strong></p>
 <p>A deafening roar rang out, causing Qing Shui to be astonished once again. This Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation technique was truly amazing and it wouldn’t even lose out to a Divine Artifact. He couldn’t help but ask, “Sir, what kind of thing is this Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to lash out with his whip as he spoke. The appearance of the phantom image grew increasingly weaker.</p>
 <p>“Wait, wait, can I throw in the towel?” the old man said bitterly and anxiously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t put down the whip, but smiled and said, “We can stop the fight, but you’ll need to agree to a few conditions.”</p>
 <p>The old man let out a sigh, “I know that you’re a man of your words. This old man trusts you. I can give you my word, but I hope that you can lend a hand when the Buddha Sect is in danger. Of course, no one can force you. It’ll be subjected to your convenience. This is voluntary.”</p>
 <p>The old man was trying to get an additional insurance, though it should be sufficient with Little Fatty around. Therefore, when Qing Shui brought up the conditions, he could increase the playing cards that he had.</p>
 <p>Although the old man said this, there was room for discussion. He knew that he wasn’t in a position to negotiate with Qing Shui. After having lived for so long, how could he not understand this?</p>
 <p>“Alright!” hearing the old man’s words Qing Shui didn’t say anything, but just smiled and agreed.</p>
 <p>“This is the thing that you want. Huoyun Peng is free.” The old man tossed Qing Shui an Interspatial Silk Sachet and his five-colored cane as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui accepted theses things calmly, not finding this to be a surprise. Everything had ended and Huoyun Peng was free. Liu-Li should now be able to put down the matter that was burdening her.</p>
 <p>This was a mental burden. After all, so many years had passed and she would still have to live on regardless of whether she could find her birth parents. Although Huoyun Liu-Li had no feelings toward her birth parents, she had met her mother, her birth mother. Bloodkin were still blood kin. It was said that when two blood kin appeared next to each other, there would be an amazing feeling. This had nothing to do with whether they were parent and child or siblings. It was the connection of their bloodline.</p>
 <p>Liu-Li’s mental burden could now be released. Qing Shui knew how such burdens felt. He didn’t stand on ceremony and looked through the items in the Interspatial Silk Sachet. When he saw a black book which exuded a glow, he smiled. It was because the words Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation were written on it.</p>
 <p>This was the thing that Qing Shui was interested in the most. Other than this, there was also the Great Golden Buddha Palm and Buddha Aura Great Illumination Formation. There was also quite a large variety of precious metals, medicinal herbs and stuff like that. He tossed the five-colored cane and the Interspatial Silk Sachet into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Don't think of Qing Shui as harsh. This was a world where the strong survived. He could be considered to have done a favor to the old man by not killing him. If not for Little Fatty, he wouldn't have done so. Qing Shui wouldn't even care if they were from the Huoyun Clan. Towards people who were thinking of killing his women, how could Qing Shui possibly let them off?</p>
 <p>With Little Fatty, Qing Shui had long planned to take over control of Buddha Sect, but he knew that it would be very difficult to accomplish. Therefore, Qing Shui knew that Little Fatty played a very important role.</p>
 <p>Although it was very difficult for him to be able to control Buddha Sect, it wasn't the same with Little Fatty. In the future, as long as Little Fatty could get strong enough, he would be able to gain control over the Buddha Sect's Supreme Elder Group. This was Buddha Sect's most powerful existence and Diamond Reverend was one of the members of this group.</p>
 <p>People in the Elder Association would also hope to get into the Supreme Elder Group in the future. Only after entering this group would they consider if they wished to enter the other four continents. However, those who had entered the Supreme Elder Group tended to be of a very old age with not a lot of lifespan left. Therefore, many of them wouldn't think of moving onto the other four continents.</p>
 <p>"Later on, I'll go meet Huoyun Peng with someone," Qing Shui smiled and said to the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man nodded. His skinny body seemed to have aged a lot suddenly. However, he seemed to finally be able to let go a lot of things as well. He looked toward Little Fatty, "Little Fatty, you can decide for yourself if you wish to follow Qing Shui or to stay in Buddha Sect. Upon my death, you'll be named the Supreme Grand Elder directly. Work hard in your cultivation. I'll give your Master all the things that you'll need."</p>
 <p>He knew that Little Fatty was an honest and sincere person. No matter what, Buddha Sect hadn't treated him badly and he knew that Little Fatty wouldn't abandon the sect.</p>
 <p>The nine branches in Buddha Sect, like the Diamond Sect and the Buddha Sword Sect, were basically aristocrat clans. Additionally, Joyous Meditation Sect was even a sect who specialized in Duo Cultivation. This really astonished Qing Shui, especially the way the monks in Joyous Meditation Sect dressed up. The people from this branches didn't appear too different from ordinary people. The only notable difference was their clothes that were like monk robes.</p>
 <p>The people from Buddha Sect returned and Qing Shui was elated when he saw Little Fatty next to him. He hadn't expected that this time around, Little Fatty would play such a crucial role against Buddha Sect. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to settle things relatively peacefully.</p>
 <p>It was because Little Fatty had made his stand and gotten the old man to take a step back. However, in the end, Qing Shui still relied on his own strength. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to turn the situation around. Little Fatty speaking up only allowed the problem to be settled relatively peacefully.</p>
 <p>"Come, let's go home first!" Qing Shui said happily toward Little Fatty.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui, the Qing Clan has a home here too?" Little Fatty said with joyful surprise.</p>
 <p>"We've just bought it. In the future, this place will also be one of the Qing Clan's residence." Qing Shui led Little Fatty back towards the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>The place where they had fought was only a little distance away from the Qing Clan and they reached the residence very soon. Qing Shui removed the formation since everything had been settled. He saw the members of the Qing Clan at the door and Huoyun Liu-Li ran over with Qing Yu in her hands.</p>
 <p>"Alright, Liu-Li, we'll go meet Senior Huoyun in a while."</p>
 <p>"Mmm!" Huoyun Liu-Li nodded fiercely, tears trickling down non-stop from her face.</p>
 <p>"Little Fatty?"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Many people from the Qing Clan had seen this big fatty who had a burly build and was like a giant. After all, it was hard to ignore such a big existence. The longer they looked at him, the more familiar they found him to be.</p>
 <p>"Aunty, Sister Qing Bei..."</p>
 <p>Back when Little Fatty was at the Qing Clan, there were only a small amount of people in the Qing Clan. Right now however, there were some few unparalleled beauties and children. Therefore, Little Fatty went into a daze, not knowing what to say.</p>
 <p>Little Fatty felt very agitated when he saw the people from the Qing Clan. When he saw Qing Yi, he even knelt down and kowtowed respectfully. Back when he was in the Qing Clan, Qing Yi had treated him like her own son.</p>
 <p>"Little Fatty, get up. What are you doing?" Qing Yi quickly helped Little Fatty up.</p>
 <p>"Aunty and the Qing Clan had treated Little Fatty well. I had to make this kowtow."</p>
 <p>"Wow, you're really Little Fatty!" Qing Bei also shouted out happily. Qing You and the others were also very agitated. After all, it had been close to 20 years since they had last seen each other.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that Little Fatty had kowtowed to his mother. Back then, he had heard that Little Fatty had kowtowed to her before he had left. Now that he came back after all these years, he did it once again. Qing Shui could sense that Little Fatty's emotions were very pure.</p>
 <p>"Mother, didn't you always say that just one son is too little? Why don't you take Little Fatty as your son as well?" Qing Shui smiled and said in a relaxed manner.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi also smiled, "If Little Fatty is willing, I'm more than happy to have one more son."</p>
 <p>"I'm willing! ... Foster mother!"</p>
 <p>Little Fatty once again respectfully dropped down to his knees and made nine kowtows.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui introduced his family members to Little Fatty. Knowing that Qing Shui had gotten himself a few wives, Little Fatty happily addressed each of them as sister-in-law.</p>
 <p>The family happily headed for the Qing Clan. Everything had ended well, and they had also brought up the story of Huoyun Liu-Li's parents. It was only now that Little Fatty understood what the story was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had wanted to head to the Buddha Sword Sect with Huoyun Liu-Li, but after looking at the time, he decided to head over the next day.</p>
 <p>Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he couldn't wait to check out the stuff the old man had given him. The thing he was most interested in was the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. He picked up the book and read it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. This Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was an assemblage battle technique. When one succeeded in cultivating it, they would reach a phase where they would awaken a Beast Armor, and would have to choose a beast variety. For example, the old man's phantom image was like a lion. This phantom image wasn't fixed and the effects attached were different based on the choice of beast.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this, he smiled and started to circulate a tremendous amount of spirit energy into his Niwan Palace before trying to perform the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Appear!</p>
 <p>Mm, it failed!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped for a while. It was normal to fail, but Qing Shui felt that he should have succeeded.</p>
 <p>He wasn't afraid of failure. Again!</p>
 <p>This was followed by several hundred consecutive failed attempts. He finally stopped when he felt dizzy. It seemed that this wasn't something which could be achieved in just a short moment. What would the old man think if he were to know that Qing Shui had wanted to succeed with his first attempt? The old man had taken ten years before he could create a phantom image himself.</p>
 <p>After some rest, Qing Shui put off the cultivation of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and picked up the Great Golden Buddha Palm. It was really the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm. However, the copy which Qing Shui had gotten wasn't a complete one. His incomplete copy was the actual copy, while the old man's replicate was a complete one.</p>
 <p>The more Qing Shui read, the more astonished he was and the more excited he became. After reading it once through, he read through from the beginning another time. He then closed his eyes and went into deep contemplation.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he lifted his head and waved his hand in the air.</p>
 <p>A huge golden palm appeared, but it shattered very quickly. Qing Shui let out an excited shout. About 15 minutes later, he looked at the golden palm which had appeared before him.</p>
 <p>It wasn't as big as the one the old man had produced and was only about ten meters in size. However, it was colored a deeper gold and was stronger. The spiritual energy on it was very powerful. It had a righteous and indestructible aura...</p>
 <p>This was Nature Energy condensed from his spirit energy?</p>
 <p>State of Immovable as Mountains?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. Next, he continued to cultivate the Great Golden Buddha Palm endlessly. He only tried to create a single one since this was the foundation and Qing Shui knew the importance of setting up one's foundation.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and went to Di Qing's room.</p>
 <p>The moment he entered Di Qing's room, a burning figure immediately dashed into his arms.</p>
 <p>"I missed you!"</p>
 <p>Her charming and stiff voice was very seductive and Qing Shui's body heated up. He placed her down on that thick bedding, met her sexy lips, and swallowed the sweetness from Di Qing's beautiful mouth.</p>
 <p>His hands also began skillfully undressed her. Qing Shui hadn't expected for Di Qing to be so proactive now. Thinking of the frenzy from the night before, his blood started to boil. The lady who was beautiful as a fairy kept up the most embarrassing pose and let Qing Shui thrust into her. Her beautiful cry due from the wondrous feeling of pleasure shot down from her head all the way through her back and down to her feet.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Di Qing's clothes left her body and her perky snow white peaks didn't show any signs of deformation even though she was lying down. It was still as perky as before and he buried his face into them...</p>
