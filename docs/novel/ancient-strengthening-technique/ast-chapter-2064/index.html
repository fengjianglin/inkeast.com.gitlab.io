 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately communicated with the Dragon Slaying Beast. From talking to it, Qing Shui became greatly shocked. He asked the Dragon Slaying Beast if it was able to hurt spirit bodies, but because he was afraid that the Dragon Slaying Beast wouldn’t know what he meant, he asked if it could hurt the Flower Demon instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The answer which he got was the golden spiral horn on its head was capable of hurting every single being. Once its sharp horn pierced through the enemy’s body, a mysterious kind of energy would appear from it and engulf the entire Dragon Slaying Beast, by then, it would be as if its body were shrouded in a mysterious strength and that would enable it to hurt the Spirit Bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was utterly shocked after hearing that. He had only thought of the sharp horn on its head as merely the sharpest part of the Dragon Slaying Beast. It was capable of piercing through everything and was even more fearsome than its teeth. But he never expected for the Golden Spiral Horn to have such a power. This was indeed incredible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui had also understood why the Flower Demon feared the Dragon Slaying Beast so much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was surprised by the violence shown by the Dragon Slaying Beast. She never expected that it would be this strong. To think that a demonic beast as small as itself would be so formidable. Speed might be a source of power, but its sharpness combined with its speed just made it all the more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main power of the Dragon Slaying Beast laid in its speed. As long as its speed was faster than its opponent, the enemy would be in danger. Once the enemy failed to dodge from its attack, it would be in danger of losing its life; this included beasts that were large. A good example would be the Flower Demonic Beast from before. The Dragon Slaying Beast could choose not to penetrate through its body, but instead, devastating the internal part of its body and only coming out once it crushed its brain and organs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hundred Flowers Body Protection!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately, bright flowers could be seen floating within an area of ten meters around the Flower Demon. If one was to look carefully at the flowers, they would notice that the flower petals were rotating continuously. Its movement was so minimal that it was almost unnoticeable. Its moving speed was ten times slower than a snail. But by staying like that, these countless flowers generated their own rhythm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To think that you would have the Monster Beast…” The Flower Demon stared at Qing Shui and was still unable to recover from her shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Monster Beast? Qing Shui was confused. It seemed that the Dragon Slaying Beast was very infamous. Regardless of what kind of demonic beasts it was, it would be fine as long as it was powerful. At the moment, Qing Shui was able to tell that the Flower Demon feared the Dragon Slaying Beast, or alternatively, the Monster Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Monster Beast was a fearsome existence in the eyes of Spirit Body animals. The infamy was due to its almost impregnable defense and formidable speed. It also specialized in sneak attacks and the moment the attack successfully landed, the victim wouldn’t be able to escape death. Legend had it that external forces wouldn’t be able to kill the Monster Beast; thus, it was a terrifying thing to ever be targeted by a Monster Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Monster Beasts were extremely rare. Basically, not one might be spotted in every one thousand years. Thus, even though all of them might fear the Monster Beast, it was still only a myth which existed in legends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demon was stunned, “Is the strength of a Monster Beast supposed to be that weak?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demon who was initially in great fear once again showed off herself. She had even begun dancing gracefully with her beautiful body. While looking at it, even Qing Shui felt that his mouth was getting dry. It seemed that it might not be so easy to break through the storm of flowers around the Flower Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui once again unleashed his Dragon-capturing Hand and immediately, a golden dragon charged towards the Flower Demon. The Dragon-capturing Hand, which had never broken its streak as an attack with 100% accuracy, had actually vanished without any noise like sinking into the vast ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, don’t you think that the Flower Storm Strangling Formation was great? If you attempt to come in, you will be repelled by it, and even if you successfully make through it, it would still go on to strangle you.” The Flower Demon said in an arrogant tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can wait until you exhaust yourself. By then, that storm of flowers of yours will be gone. It’s still not too late to kill you by then.” Qing Shui looked at the storm of flowers all around him and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, I forgot to tell you one thing. Commanding these storms of flowers is like my second instinct. It’s just like my arms. I won’t be exhausted from using it. The sole reason I don’t keep it active constantly is due to the uncomfortable feeling after I have used this technique. After all, if I were to do that, everything around me would have been destroyed. But if we are engaged in a fight, I can keep it activated just fine.” The Flower Demon said it with a happy smile, showing indescribable arrogance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also never expected things would turn out like this. It seemed that this Flower Demon was indeed a special being. If it was a fairy given birth by heaven and earth themselves, it would mean that this fairy was the most favored child of nature. Qing Shui was really envious of it. He had tried attacking her a few times, but he wasn’t able to destroy the Flower Storm Strangling Formation with his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he didn’t break it, the Dragon Slaying Beast wouldn’t be able to go in and pierce it with its horn. If it continued on like this, Qing Shui wouldn’t be able to do anything other than getting beaten up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little darling, it’s about time I make my move. Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Flower Sword in her hand, the Flower Demon charged towards Qing Shui with her Flower Storm Strangling Formation in effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a mysterious assortment of flowers with unique power. Qing Shui had his eyes fixed on the flowers that were revolving ever so slowly. There was a kind of bizarre energy contained in each of them. Qing Shui had been looking at it for a long time. Though he might possess decent knowledge in formations, he was unable to see through any ways to destroy this particular formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong-hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With two slashes, the Flower Demon immediately blew Qing Shui and the Nine Continents Mountain away. However, she didn’t manage to hurt Qing Shui. At this moment, he activated the Heavenly Vision Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a moment, the speed of the Flower Demon dropped. With that happening, Qing Shui was now able to dodge from the attacks with ease. It was a pity that he was still unable to cause any damage to the opponent’s body. But with the Heavenly Vision Technique in effect, Qing Shui suddenly was able to notice some things which he wasn’t able to see before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these flowers were shaking at terrifying speeds. Because they were shaking so fast, they seemed almost static. Even though one might not mean much, there were tens of thousands of them. It was precisely this kind of vibration that was unique. Furthermore, there was invisible energy that was connecting them together. By now, Qing Shui was already able to figure out what kind of energy this was. To think that these flowers would have such a terrifying function to protect the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the power of resonance! It was also a power in the shape of a spiral! The Resonating Spiral Force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resonating Spiral Force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his previous incarnation, when a few horses’ stomps resonated with each other, their combined might was capable of breaking a bridge. But if they failed to resonate with each other, the bridge wouldn’t break even if a thousand or even ten thousands of horses were to stomp through it. This was the power of resonance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each of the flowers contained mysterious powers. This power might be insignificant to people like Qing Shui individually, but there were thousands of them here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were still rotating slowly. Thus, not only did the Dragon Slaying Beast get repelled upon contact with it, but its total strength would also be greatly reduced by this spiraling forces. This would cause the attacks caused by the storm of flowers to be even more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder it was so terrifying. If it wasn’t for the Dragon Slaying Beast’s formidable strength, even if he didn’t die from being shot by it, he would at least suffer heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demon also got very upset from the fight. How could this man possess such formidable defense? And his body motions… She was actually unable to hit him. If this kept going on, neither one of them would emerge victoriously. Thinking up to this point, she got very annoyed and angry. The moment her head became filled with anger, Qing Shui realized that the storm of flowers had actually started to become a bit unstable.</span></p>

But while he was getting pushed back, he tried to feel the power that was able to jolt his body. Qing Shui’s eyes turned bright. His Spiritual Sense was already agile to begin with. With further assistance provided by the Heavenly Dao, he actually managed to detect the frequency of the storm of flowers.</span></p>

Every time he did so, a flower would break. The Flower Demon got really scared seeing that. As she became consumed by fear, the storm of flowers in the sky would start to get a bit disoriented, causing a part of them to become unstable.</span></p>

By now, she was already sunk in great fear. But right at this moment, Qing Shui’s Dragon-capturing Hands penetrated through the storm of flowers in the sky and landed on the Flower Demon’s face.</span></p>
