 <p><strong>Chapter 309 Qing Shui, Go Calm Your Fiancee Down.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 309 - Qing Shui, Go Calm Your Fiancee Down</strong></p>
  <p><span style>No one could tell what Song Lang was thinking. He lunged towards Qing Shui with a slash from the whip like a flick from a dragon's tail. This technique was as superior as the one from before, but it was more sinister and tricky.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui did not feel threatened at all this time. This wonderful feeling may have something to do with the enhancement of his current state of mind. He naturally stepped backwards, and in an instant, rushed forward with the speed of light in a natural motion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With the correct timing, he evaded the opponent's long whip as he stepped backwards. During the moment when the opponent used his whip to attack, he used the Cloudmist Steps to dodge out of harm's way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unexpectedly, this technique was faster than before, as if he just walked through a shortcut!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Song Lang stood there blankly. He knew in that moment that there was a huge gap between both of them! As Song Lang stared blankly at the incoming dull blow from the sword, he knew that this is a final death blow.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Brother, please have mercy!" A resonant voice rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As Qing Shui remembered the murderous intent from Song Lang's eyes, he wanted to cripple him even if he couldn't kill him. Qing Shui did not waste any effort and proceed to plunge his blade towards Song Lang. For ordinary people, it would seem like it was too late to restrain his blade from going forward.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the precise moment when Qing Shui's blade was almost touching Song Lang's flesh, a shadowy sword came just in time to block Qing Shui's blade. The clash of the blade clanked like a sound from a bell.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could only feel a surge of energy emanating from the Big Dipper sword. He couldn't not withstand the energy, so he retreated three steps to stabilize himself. Qing Shui lifted up his head to face the man who saved Song Lang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The dark burly man had a bunch of beard, thick eyebrow and big eyes, especially a pair of sparkling eyes that resembled two black gemstones, thick lips, and a droopy nose. But this man gave Qing Shui an impression of being a generous and dignified man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"My boy Lang, are you okay?" A burly man faced a pale-faced Song Lang as he spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Song Lang shook his head depressingly. Although he did not die, he was the man who was always arrogant and now felt despair from his loss. At least the pressure that he has had will not vanish, and he could never lift up his head wherever he goes. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Because he lost the battle at the Starmoon Hall!</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Brother, the fight will stop for now. You looked admirable. On behalf of the Song Family, I will compensate you a little while later." &nbsp;The dark burly man smiled as he said that, flashing his teeth as white as light.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui speculated that the man has a high ranker in the Song Family based on how he called Song Lang as 'my boy Lang'. Otherwise, this burly man would not even dare to make compensations on behalf of the Song Family.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As it was not wise to arouse any trouble with the man, Qing Shui decided to spare Song Lang. Furthermore, he had to take up the offer to spare his opponent as this dark large man's power was no laughing matter. Qing Shui was also beginning to sense a few strong figures surrounding the area.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"3rd Brother Hei, why are you bullying my people of Starmoon Hall." A familiar voice rang across the hall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled, he called out to the Fei Wuji who suddenly appear beside him - the man he respected the most: "Martial Uncle!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Brother Wuji, it’s amisunderstanding, it was just all a misunderstanding. Kids will inevitably have arguments. This time it was my boy Lang's fault. I have already ask to compensate on behalf of Song Family. I will definitely make amends for this brother over here." The man known as 3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> Brother Hei said in a straightforward manner. He had a modest and gentle smile and expression. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"Haha, good, if I don't fuss over this and remember Song Family's amendments, then I will be humiliating the entire Song Family!" Fei Wuji laughed bluntly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> Uncle, father, master, they..." Song Lang face looked pale.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Let's go back and talk.", said 3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> Brother Hei while maintaining his modest smile.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, the Starmoon Hall's cheers rang out in the public square, especially cheers from the male audiences. &nbsp;They started to surround Qing Shui, but backed off the moment Qing Shui frowned. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, go to where the old man is. They girls are there too and everyone has gathered. Liu-li was just nagging that you haven't see her for more than a month." Fei Wuji smiled pleasantly. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui nodded: "Okay, I will go look for old man as well."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fei Wuji always feel impressed whenever he sees Qing Shui. This youngster has improved too fast. Some time ago, he was still lamenting on the aura of Immovable mountain on Qing Shui's body, because Fei Wuji's aura is not as dignified as Qing Shui's.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fei Wuji's life was not perfect. He lacked some things, for example, affections from children, father, mother, the passion of love...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had barely escape death, and had seen a lot of things. His exceptional state of mind and perception, and appreciation allowed Qing Shui to understand his intense "Immovable Mountain" aura by chance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just before two months has passed, Fei Wuji noticed the aura on Qing Shui's body had changed again. The change is like a more condensed but simple addition to the foundation of Immovable Mountain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui realized that he has been spending two months of his time practicing his skills. He had not been seeing two of the ladies. He did not want to think of anything else, so he focused his time on his practice to paralyze himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he reached Cang Wuya's place, the two ladies walked out happily when they heard both Qing Shui's and Fei Wuji's footsteps. Qing Shui could feel their care, thoughts, and other unidentified feelings from their starry pretty eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui awkwardly touched his nose when he saw the hidden bitterness in their eyes. Huoyun Liu-li ran towards him and hugged his neck.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"He he he!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>As she saw how stiff Qing Shui was standing over there, Huoyun Liu-li laughed distinctively, as if charmingly and maliciously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fei Wuji chuckled a bit and went inside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui lightly placed his arms around Huoyun Liu-li's slim waist, then picked her up from the ground and twirled a few rounds before placing her down. Her subtle sweet fragrance enveloped and dwelled inside his nose. Qing Shui could feel the soft and exquisite sensation from the embrace as he was swayed momentarily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A womanizer such as Qing Shui had long not tasted the flavor of "meat", andbefore he could say anything, he quickly let go of Huoyun Liu-li. At that moment, Qing Shui noticed a slight amusement in between her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-li laughed for a couple more moments and pushed Qing Shui towards Canghai Mingyue, "Just calm your fiancee down before she gets snatched by other people."</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Liu-li, what nonsense are you talking about..."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-li giggled shrewdly as she walked straight into the house!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui understood that Huoyun Liu-li was talking about how Song Lang was trying to woo Canghai Mingyue. He also didn't know how long she has been bothered by that poor kid in this short period of time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Haha, Yue-Yue, let me hear you call out your husband, after all, you are my fiance now." Qing Shui softly embraced Canghai Mingyue's silky waist.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui got excited by this wonderful feeling, as if he was floating and could not hold onto the ground. This is not the first time they had any interaction between their bodies. Perhaps he had stolen her kiss once, but he would always feel touched in a indescribable way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She promised Qing Shui she would let him hug her!</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, please don't listen to Liu-li's nonsense..."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue did not struggle away from Qing Shui's embrace, because he would not take advantage of her even though he was embracing her waist. But he was a bit playful with his words.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Which disciple from the Starday Hall did you have feelings for?" Qing Shui playfully smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, Qing Shui was three parts courteous, three parts gentle, and three parts devilish, and one part </span><span style>persistent</span><span style>. Canghai Mingyue saw that Qing Shui was beside her, but she felt that she could not see through him clearly, as if he was even more unfamiliar then before. </span></p>
  <p><span style>However, she did not reject Qing Shui. She remembered the things Qing Shui had done for her, and looked at Qing Shui momentarily. Her dark eyes stared at Qing Shui without blinking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt unnatural with her deep boundless eyes staring at him, so he lightly tapped on her prominent shoulder.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As she felt the tap on her smooth and soft shoulder, Canghai Mingyue snapped back from her daze and exclaimed. Her face was flushed pink from embarrassment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was dazed from her beautiful eyes and the fluttering of her long neat eyelashes. Her beauty was enough to make Qing Shui quiver.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Let's go in, it's not good being out here like this!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>The ambiguous atmosphere lasted for a moment as Cang Hai MingYue spoke softly. She did not answer Qing Shui's mocking question because she felt that there was no need to discuss further on the senseless topic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled and nodded as he let go of Cang Hai MingYue's silky waist. He then walked beside her into the living room.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Cang Wuya saw Qing Shui once again, he gazed with an obvious astonishment. But Qing Shui had already given him too many surprises, so Cang Wuya was able to accept the situation despite being surprised.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As he looked at both Qing Shui and Cang Hai MingYue, Cang Wuya had a satisfyied smile because both of them were walking in side-by-side!</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I am sorry I did not come visit old man for a while." Qing Shui smiled as he spoke to Cang Wuya.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Haha, young people should focus more on training. You did good. This old man can feel that you have a heart. Although I am old now, I am still experienced with some things. If you have anything that bothers you, please talk to me. Maybe I could still be of help to you. I only have you guys left."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya's words were kind. Qing Shui was able to feel his sincerity through his words. There was no dishonesty in his voice. Most importantly, Qing Shui was able to feel how much Cang Wuya wanted to him and Cang Hai MingYue to walk through the path together, perhaps also with Huoyun Liu-li.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, the reason I want to see you was to actually talk about the business with the Song Family." Cang Wuya smiled softly as he sat near the coffee table around everyone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was startled, to be able to make the old man initiate the topic about a certain family must be a powerful family, at least powerful enough in the Heavenly Palace. Qing Shui was seriously ready to listen. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"You don't have to worry, I have already told you before that I would help, as long as you don't take innocent lives, I will help you. Whatever it is, I will protect your life. What's more, this is just a normal exchange between us." &nbsp;Cang Wuya said as he noticed how Qing Shui was acting a bit nervous.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had a peace of mind again after listening to Cang Wuya's words. He felt he had a support, like leaning against a big sturdy tree. If he didn't have the blessing and protection of the seniors, he would have been a coward his whole life. A genius would have failed prematurely as well.</span></p>

 <p><span style>"Brother Wuji, it’s amisunderstanding, it was just all a misunderstanding. Kids will inevitably have arguments. This time it was my boy Lang's fault. I have already ask to compensate on behalf of Song Family. I will definitely make amends for this brother over here." The man known as 3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> Brother Hei said in a straightforward manner. He had a modest and gentle smile and expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, good, if I don't fuss over this and remember Song Family's amendments, then I will be humiliating the entire Song Family!" Fei Wuji laughed bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> Uncle, father, master, they..." Song Lang face looked pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go back and talk.", said 3</span><span style>rd</span><span style> Brother Hei while maintaining his modest smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the Starmoon Hall's cheers rang out in the public square, especially cheers from the male audiences. &nbsp;They started to surround Qing Shui, but backed off the moment Qing Shui frowned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, go to where the old man is. They girls are there too and everyone has gathered. Liu-li was just nagging that you haven't see her for more than a month." Fei Wuji smiled pleasantly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui nodded: "Okay, I will go look for old man as well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Wuji always feel impressed whenever he sees Qing Shui. This youngster has improved too fast. Some time ago, he was still lamenting on the aura of Immovable mountain on Qing Shui's body, because Fei Wuji's aura is not as dignified as Qing Shui's.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Wuji's life was not perfect. He lacked some things, for example, affections from children, father, mother, the passion of love...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had barely escape death, and had seen a lot of things. His exceptional state of mind and perception, and appreciation allowed Qing Shui to understand his intense "Immovable Mountain" aura by chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just before two months has passed, Fei Wuji noticed the aura on Qing Shui's body had changed again. The change is like a more condensed but simple addition to the foundation of Immovable Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui realized that he has been spending two months of his time practicing his skills. He had not been seeing two of the ladies. He did not want to think of anything else, so he focused his time on his practice to paralyze himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he reached Cang Wuya's place, the two ladies walked out happily when they heard both Qing Shui's and Fei Wuji's footsteps. Qing Shui could feel their care, thoughts, and other unidentified feelings from their starry pretty eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui awkwardly touched his nose when he saw the hidden bitterness in their eyes. Huoyun Liu-li ran towards him and hugged his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He he he!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she saw how stiff Qing Shui was standing over there, Huoyun Liu-li laughed distinctively, as if charmingly and maliciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Wuji chuckled a bit and went inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui lightly placed his arms around Huoyun Liu-li's slim waist, then picked her up from the ground and twirled a few rounds before placing her down. Her subtle sweet fragrance enveloped and dwelled inside his nose. Qing Shui could feel the soft and exquisite sensation from the embrace as he was swayed momentarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A womanizer such as Qing Shui had long not tasted the flavor of "meat", andbefore he could say anything, he quickly let go of Huoyun Liu-li. At that moment, Qing Shui noticed a slight amusement in between her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-li laughed for a couple more moments and pushed Qing Shui towards Canghai Mingyue, "Just calm your fiancee down before she gets snatched by other people."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Liu-li, what nonsense are you talking about..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-li giggled shrewdly as she walked straight into the house!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui understood that Huoyun Liu-li was talking about how Song Lang was trying to woo Canghai Mingyue. He also didn't know how long she has been bothered by that poor kid in this short period of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, Yue-Yue, let me hear you call out your husband, after all, you are my fiance now." Qing Shui softly embraced Canghai Mingyue's silky waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui got excited by this wonderful feeling, as if he was floating and could not hold onto the ground. This is not the first time they had any interaction between their bodies. Perhaps he had stolen her kiss once, but he would always feel touched in a indescribable way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She promised Qing Shui she would let him hug her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, please don't listen to Liu-li's nonsense..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue did not struggle away from Qing Shui's embrace, because he would not take advantage of her even though he was embracing her waist. But he was a bit playful with his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Which disciple from the Starday Hall did you have feelings for?" Qing Shui playfully smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Qing Shui was three parts courteous, three parts gentle, and three parts devilish, and one part </span><span style>persistent</span><span style>. Canghai Mingyue saw that Qing Shui was beside her, but she felt that she could not see through him clearly, as if he was even more unfamiliar then before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she did not reject Qing Shui. She remembered the things Qing Shui had done for her, and looked at Qing Shui momentarily. Her dark eyes stared at Qing Shui without blinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui felt unnatural with her deep boundless eyes staring at him, so he lightly tapped on her prominent shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she felt the tap on her smooth and soft shoulder, Canghai Mingyue snapped back from her daze and exclaimed. Her face was flushed pink from embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was dazed from her beautiful eyes and the fluttering of her long neat eyelashes. Her beauty was enough to make Qing Shui quiver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go in, it's not good being out here like this!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ambiguous atmosphere lasted for a moment as Cang Hai MingYue spoke softly. She did not answer Qing Shui's mocking question because she felt that there was no need to discuss further on the senseless topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled and nodded as he let go of Cang Hai MingYue's silky waist. He then walked beside her into the living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Cang Wuya saw Qing Shui once again, he gazed with an obvious astonishment. But Qing Shui had already given him too many surprises, so Cang Wuya was able to accept the situation despite being surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he looked at both Qing Shui and Cang Hai MingYue, Cang Wuya had a satisfyied smile because both of them were walking in side-by-side!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am sorry I did not come visit old man for a while." Qing Shui smiled as he spoke to Cang Wuya.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, young people should focus more on training. You did good. This old man can feel that you have a heart. Although I am old now, I am still experienced with some things. If you have anything that bothers you, please talk to me. Maybe I could still be of help to you. I only have you guys left."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Wuya's words were kind. Qing Shui was able to feel his sincerity through his words. There was no dishonesty in his voice. Most importantly, Qing Shui was able to feel how much Cang Wuya wanted to him and Cang Hai MingYue to walk through the path together, perhaps also with Huoyun Liu-li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, the reason I want to see you was to actually talk about the business with the Song Family." Cang Wuya smiled softly as he sat near the coffee table around everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was startled, to be able to make the old man initiate the topic about a certain family must be a powerful family, at least powerful enough in the Heavenly Palace. Qing Shui was seriously ready to listen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"You don't have to worry, I have already told you before that I would help, as long as you don't take innocent lives, I will help you. Whatever it is, I will protect your life. What's more, this is just a normal exchange between us." &nbsp;Cang Wuya said as he noticed how Qing Shui was acting a bit nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had a peace of mind again after listening to Cang Wuya's words. He felt he had a support, like leaning against a big sturdy tree. If he didn't have the blessing and protection of the seniors, he would have been a coward his whole life. A genius would have failed prematurely as well.</span></p>
