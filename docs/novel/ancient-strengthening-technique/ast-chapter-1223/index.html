 <p><strong>AST 1223 - No alternative, confinement strength, toughness, the tyrannical Saint Child Band</strong></p>
 <p>“I am the witness!” Tian Jiange shouted from below.</p>
 <p>“You are his brother. Friends and family members are not allowed to be witnesses. If this were allowed, I would have been able to prove that I had never mentioned anything about accepting the bet!” Fu Yanting’s face didn’t look red, nor was his heart thumping fast. Qing Shui really admired his accomplishment in terms of being shameless.</p>
 <p>The others didn’t have the guts to prove it. Fu Yanting would definitely dig up the graves of the ancestors of whoever dared to make him lose his arms. People who survived would feel as if they were dead.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange on the other hand, wasn’t really scared of him. However, he really couldn’t do anything about him.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, forget about it!” At this moment, the eldest princess who was watching from a distance spoke out. He observed the surroundings and realized that only he was able to hear her. He looked at the princess confused.</p>
 <p>The eldest princess nodded her head at him. Qing Shui knew that he wouldn’t be able to break off his arms today. But it didn’t mean that Qing Shui would let go of him. The reason being that he realized that people like Fu Yanting would definitely not admit defeat so easily.</p>
 <p>Roaming Dragon Steps!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>“You big bully.” Qing Shui spoke up. While speaking, he rapidly took out a golden needle and pierced it quickly into Fu Yanting’s ears and head while holding Fu Yanting’s arm with his other hand.</p>
 <p>From other people’s view, Qing Shui may seem like he was trying to break off Fu Yanting’s arm. However, only Qing Shui himself knew what he was doing. He didn’t know if others were able to tell but his movements were very obscure. So obscure that no one was able to find out anything about it. The reason being that the Gold Needle which was thin like a cow’s skin didn’t leave behind any evidence. Even Fu Yanting himself felt nothing.</p>
 <p>“You dare? You are underestimating Heaven Secrets Academy!” Fu Yanting screamed loudly.</p>
 <p>“Forget it, he has already admitted defeat. Lets sort out the grudge you two hold against each other some other day,” the old man who was being the judge stepped forward and spoke at this moment.</p>
 <p>Fu Yanting smiled at Qing Shui before going down to the arena. He showed a face which looked as if he was the person who won the battle. But actually, only Fu Yanting knew that his heart was bleeding. The Golden Yang Wolf was dead. He has already made up his mind that he would definitely kill this man.</p>
 <p>However, he wasn’t aware that Qing Shui already laid hands on him. The thing he was injected with was the Nine Yang Life Seeking Needle. So long as Qing Shui found necessary, he could make Fu Yanting die suddenly without making any moves. But he didn’t find now to be an appropriate time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t in the mood to continue standing guard in the arena. He was also about to head down to the arena. Normally, no one would be willing to challenge him since his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant exploded onto the scene. Despite him leaving the stage, he had unknowingly helped significantly raise the honor of Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>Today, it could be considered that he had officially planted a seed of hatred within Fu Yanting or maybe, even Saint Child Band. Furthermore, it was planted deep. At least he had already embarrassed Saint Child Band. The stronger an organization was, the more concern they would show towards their reputation. Hence, a day would come when Qing Shui and Saint Child Band tried to strangle each other to death. The majority of people thought that Qing Shui would vanish very soon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went down to the arena. Tian Jiange patted him happily, “Brother, you are indeed really powerful. You violated Saint Child Band because of me but worry not, at least I can guarantee that they won’t seek trouble from you.”</p>
 <p>“Can you guarantee that?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“For the time being, the powerful people from Saint Child Band are unlikely to come looking for you. I believe that you would have been handle those small fries fairly easily.” Tian Jiange was really happy. Of course he would be, seeing Fu Yanting getting eaten empty was something which he looked forward to the most. Furthermore, the Golden Yang Wolf which Fu Yanting had been proud of and relied on the most had now died. This was a significant loss to him.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange didn’t ask anything like why he didn’t break off Fu Yanting’s arms. Previously, even though he had said that he could be a witness, that only meant that he didn’t fear Fu Yanting. He wasn’t actually supporting Qing Shui breaking off his arms. This was because if Qing Shui really did that, it would have been very difficult for Qing Shui to stay alive.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange was aware that there would definitely people be stopping Qing Shui if he really wanted to break off his arms. For example, the leader of Breezing Wind Veranda, Saint Child or the woman whom his elder brother was after. She knew how strong Saint Child was. She would definitely not let Qing Shui break off Fu Yanting’s arms.</p>
 <p>“Well then, I apologize in advance for the trouble caused to brother then,” Qing Shui said formally. It was also quite a good thing to have a few friends helping him at a time like this. At the moment, he was still quite weak. But what he was happy about was that he still had the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. At least no Grade Four Masters or people below that could threaten him.</p>
 <p>Added on that he had the Emperor’s Qi. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was definitely an invincible existence among the entire Grade Four State Masters force.</p>
 <p>“We’re brothers. There’s no need for you to be so formal with me. Let alone this whole problem this time started because of me,” Tian Jiange explained with a smile. He didn’t know that prior to this, there had already been disputes between Qing Shui and Fu Yanting.</p>
 <p>A lot of people were curious as to why Qing Shui didn’t continue to remain on stage even after he won. Nevertheless, no one commented on it. The victors had the right to choose whether they wanted to stay.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only went up once for the competition this time. However, a lot of people already remembered Qing Shui in their minds. Not only because of his formidable dragon elephant, it was also because Qing Shui himself had proven himself to be really powerful. A few of the elders from the academy also took a fancy to Qing Shui’s future. Unfortunately, it was interrupted by Saint Child Band.</p>
 <p>Don’t underestimate Saint Child Band. It was a gang which even some elders from Heaven Secrets Academy wouldn’t dare to provoke.</p>
 <p>No one looked for Qing Shui, which was something which he wanted. Now, he had already thrown away his intentions to make the elder his teacher, let alone that he would most likely have been able to toss these elders far behind once he refined the strength within his body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left before the competition ended. He would definitely kill people like Fu Yanting. In fact, it should be very soon. The day when he became capable would be the day Fu Yanting died.</p>
 <p>Both the little girl and Qing Shui left while Yan Jinyu and Seventh Princess stayed behind.</p>
 <p>By the time they went back to their residence, Qing Shui let out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He wanted to take a look at the current situation. Amidst the battle, he could feel that the sixty fourth star had been put into its rightful place. Furthermore, he had also seen the Eight Trigram Cosmic Images from the Golden Buddha Palm imprint which he released.</p>
 <p>He immersed himself within his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the sea of nebula has gotten a lot bigger again within his sea of consciousness. The other nebula had officially separated itself away from the sixty four stars. The gold star was right in the center of the sixty four stars. It gave off abundant golden light, it was very bright, yet it wasn’t harsh.</p>
 <p>Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui activated it instantly and felt the change in his strength only to find himself confused once again. His strength didn’t change. It only increased a little bit. The Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation helped raise spirit energy attacks by one fold but the Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation continued to maintain it at only one fold. This only meant that compared to the previous formation, there weren’t really many improvements.</p>
 <p>In doubt, Qing Shui used it a number of times only to get the same result. Upon trying it countless times, Qing Shui had no choice but to face reality. The strength of both the Eight-eight and Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation were the same. But what was the use of the eight trigram picture?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped thinking only about strength in his experiment this time. Slowly, he came to notice the problem with the Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation. Even though it didn’t directly increase the strength of spirit energy attacks, it helped make the spirit energy within the sea of consciousness more abundant. Also, in terms of its toughness as well as its confinement strength, they had both become more powerful by more than one fold.</p>
 <p>For example, if Qing Shui was to use the Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation at the time he used the Confinement Strength of Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, he could make the confinement strength of the golden palm imprint which looked like a golden lotus to go up by one fold.</p>
 <p>And also, the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines had become a lot tougher. With good toughness, it would be even more capable of trapping its opponent. Hence, toughness was one of the most crucial aspects of the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines.</p>
 <p>The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal didn’t ascend in grade. Qing Shui wasn’t really that upset but deep down, he still found it a bit depressing. It had been a long time since he last upgraded the realm. Could it be that he really needed a woman in order to upgrade it? Who could he look for?</p>
 <p>The final Mysterious Fruit had also been refined into Spiritual Liquid and consumed. Now, Qing Shui felt a bit helpless in terms of upgrading the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>He let out a long sigh and carried on with his cultivation. Qing Shui also refined his magic treasures. If they were able to break through, the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant would once again take another huge leap. The time for the Nirvanic Fruit to ripen was near. The Fire Bird had already been guarding that spot for many days. Normally, it would only behave this way at the time when the fruits were about to ripen.</p>
 <p>He was also really excited, excited for the day when the Fire Bird had another transformation. At present, the Six-headed Demonic Spider’s strength was also quite formidable. It was very intelligent. That metallic, soft and immature voice of its was also slowly maturing. Now, it seemed to be sounding more and more like the voice of a young lady. Qing Shui found it really weird, the reason being that now, the Six-headed Demonic Spider was almost as intelligent as the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>An Immortal Demon, Qing Shui felt that in the future, this Six-headed Demonic Spider might end up a being equivalent to that of an Immortal Demon. The reason why such weird thoughts arose in Qing Shui was because of the intelligence possessed by this Six-headed Demonic Spider. But as he remembered the fact that Immortal Fairy had to be at False God Grade, he found his thought really absurd.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the friendly competition between Heaven Secret Academy and Divine Might Dynasty ended. What shocked Qing Shui was that Tian Jiange and Hu Yiya had become a couple.</p>
 <p>Even though back then, Qing Shui was able to tell that Hu Yiya liked Tian Jiange, he never thought that Tian Jiange would feel the same for her. Indeed, it was easier for women to go after men instead of the other way round. Just a soft poke would have easily broken the barrier between them and established the relationship.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t really feel anything for the friendly competition this time. Originally, he wanted to take a peek at the strength of the young generations from Divine Might Dynasty but he soon lost interest because of the appearance of Fu Yanting and the fight they had. That incident caused him to feel solely that he only wanted to break through as soon as possible and refine the strength within him. The most unworthy thing that could happen was someone ending up broken after standing guard over a mountain of gold.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Yet another month passed. Suddenly, a group of people came into Qing Shui’s manor. There were more than ten of them.</p>
 <p>This entire month went on really quietly. So quiet that even Qing Shui himself found it hard to believe. Today, at least fifty men burst into his house right away. Among them, there were seniors as well as youngsters. But with one glance, Qing Shui could already tell that the group was led by two men.</p>
 <p>These were two elderly men with balanced builds. One of them was wearing a blue colored gown whereas the other one wore a light grey gown. Qing Shui didn’t notice them just because they were standing in front of him. On the contrary, it was because of their auras which felt as deep as an ocean.</p>
 <p>“Young man, the reason why we came uninvited today is to get back something which belonged to us.” The old man in blue gown slightly knitted his brows. But very quickly, he released it.</p>
 <p>“What would you like to get back? What’s so important for you to go to the extent of even mustering such a large force.” Qing Shui hinted to the girl behind him to leave.</p>
 <p>“We are people from Saint Child Band. Saint Child has given us orders to come and get back something from you.” The old man in grey gown who was standing at the side calmly stared at Qing Shui. The old man’s eyes looked way too gloomy.</p>
 <p>“What thing?” Qing Shui asked in confusion.</p>
 <p>“An arm, an arm of yours.” Like before, the old man was still looking at Qing Shui really calmly.</p>
