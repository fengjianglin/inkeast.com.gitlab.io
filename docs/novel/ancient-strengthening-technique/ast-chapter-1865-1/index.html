 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun said in a displeased tone. Her charms, as well as her elegant voice, made her very attractive. But for the time being, she still kept her distance from Qing Shui. If they continued to hug each other at a time like this, she was sure that Qing Shui would act</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful on your journey and take care of yourself!” Sheng Jun said gently. She didn’t like being sloppy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, “You too. There are many things which you can be happy about. There are some things in life which you shouldn’t think too much about. You have yet to experience sex which we talked about previously. If you are to pass away like that, your life wouldn’t have been worth living. Don’t you want to know how it feels to be in seventh heaven? Don’t you want to have a child of your own? There are many things which can help to make one’s life better, this also includes a romantic love.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui vanished immediately. He wasn’t sure if he was acting like a hoodlum while bidding his farewell with this kind of method. But before this, he sensed a faint suicide intention from the woman. He only wanted to give her some hope to continue living.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she saw Qing Shui’s figure disappearing in front of her. His words that came into her ears made her felt both angry and shy. But she was feeling something else even stronger. He was right, there were indeed many things to accomplish in one’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had often hoped that one day, a man whom she liked would appear. Until now, she has always lived independently on her own. The reason why she refused to get married to anyone was that she had yet to find anyone who suited her. Deep down, everyone would crave to be loved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t get angry with what Qing Shui had said. Naturally, she would understand what Qing Shui’s true intention was. Though he might be lecherous, could he still be considered a man if he wasn’t?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was men’s nature to be lecherous. It was just like how a person enjoyed seeing cash, it was fine as long as he didn’t try to earn it through immoral acts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t hate this man’s personality. She knew that men who were capable would usually have more than one wife on his side. This was why she was at a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was normal for a man to have multiple wives in this world. But since there were countless incidents where the women fought among themselves to strive for favors from their husband, it came to show that deep down, they still desired to be the only person whom their husband would love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was only a dream, especially in the case of outstanding men and women. Outstanding men could have many wives, but if an excellent woman didn’t want to look for an ordinary man, she would have to prepare herself to share a husband with other women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not easy to meet someone whom you liked in such a vast world, especially in the case of women like Sheng Jun. Under normal circumstances, every man or woman would have a person whom they were fond of. Furthermore, it could be someone very close to them, like their childhood friends. One could always adjust the standard which they expected from their other half. There was an extent to which they could be picky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was different in the case of Sheng Jun who was the Sacred Fairy Inheritor. She appreciated the feelings with her heart. The majority of disciples from aristocratic clans, for example, Liancheng Biao from the Heaven Star Immortal Sect could already be considered to be very outstanding and was definitely a one in a thousand good man. There was nothing to complain about when it came to his temperament or his looks. Unfortunately, disciples from aristocratic clans were her least favorite. The good backgrounds which they had, have caused them to develop a lot of the personalities which she wasn’t fond of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was until when Qing Shui showed up. This man was even more outstanding than Lian Chengbiao. In fact, he was the most outstanding man that she has met so far. Even though she only knew very little about him, but by considering how powerful he was, there was no doubt he came from an aristocratic clan. Only he didn’t have the aura which disciples from aristocratic clans usually had. His aura was more natural in a way which words couldn’t describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking back to the time when he hugged her, Sheng Jun blushed. She didn’t know how things turned out to be like this, but she didn’t regret it. As she pondered over that, she has come to understand one thing. She seemed to have fallen for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t seem to be too shocked to realize it. It was that kind of indescribable feeling that had slowly started to grow in her heart. From time to time, Qing Shui's figure would appear in her mind and she would hear his voice in her ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this was how it felt to like a person…… Since when did it start?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t return to the Vampiric Demoness Hills after he left. Everything should be fine there. Since the heritage on Vampiric Demoness Hills could last for so long, naturally, they would have their own means to survive. They wouldn’t become any weaker just because of his sudden appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He managed to return fairly quickly considering that the Five Elements Divine Flag could make him appear right away in the Divine Cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was required to rush through his journeys when he was heading to the Sacred Mountain, it wasn’t necessary for him to do the same when he was heading back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take him long to head off to the Sunset Sea King Palace from the Divine Cave. Inconspicuously, half a year had passed since he headed off to the Sacred Mountain. Though six months weren’t really that long, it didn’t stop him from missing his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Sea King Palace was located in a sensitive place. This place could already be considered as the inner part of the Northern Sea. There were numerous forces which they would interact with. But for now, both Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing should also be here. Since her breakthrough last time, Tantai Lingyan had become significantly more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Sea King Palace was already within sight. After he saw that it still looked the same as before, Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel relieved. He proceeded to step into the entrance towards the main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he stepped in, he already saw Tantai Lingyan happened to be coming out from the opposite direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was dressed in a snow white dress and her dress flowed in the wind, making her looked elegant like a fairy. On her cold face, there was an extraordinary temperament which could even conquer the world. Qing Shui was stunned. She has changed, she was emitting an aura which resembled that of a fairy, making people felt that she was unapproachable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was likely that she has broken through again. Tantai Lingyan was also surprised when she saw Qing Shui. After all, Qing Shui's appearance was too sudden. But very soon, her mouth curved into a smile. Though her smile wasn’t enough to be called seducing, a person would definitely lose his soul from looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You came back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was unable to hide her joy in her elegant and cold voice. Qing Shui immediately approached her with a smile and put both his arms around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have missed you so so much.” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan trembled. It was a very small movement. Qing Shui’s words have made her felt a sense of warmth in her heart. Only Qing Shui would be able to do that. She has always been walking through this world alone. All this time, she has only carried the will of vengeance alone. She was already getting very tired from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, she has managed to make some friends here. Such as Qin Qing, Yiye Jiange, Luo Qingcheng, Muyun Qingge as well as Qing Hanye. They were also like sister figures to her. All of these have changed her a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui had a special place in her heart. She wasn’t able to forget about him, not in the past, nor in the future. If 10 years ago, he had failed to show up or if he was only an ordinary person, even if she was unable to forget him for now. The feeling would slowly fade away.</span></p>
