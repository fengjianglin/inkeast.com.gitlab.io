 <p><strong>Chapter 363 Half A Year Passed By In An Instant, Change, 2-Color Graded Armor, Peach of Immortality.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 363 Half A Year Passed By In An Instant, Change, 2-Color Graded Armor, Peach of Immortality</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed by amidst the calm and anxiety, and in the blink of an eye, half a year's time had passed. While half a year was not very long, to Qing Shui, the changes were very big.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Half a year's time was equivalent to Qing Shui having spent closed to about twenty years in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This was his advantage and the effects were even greater than the best Spirit Concentrating Pill across the world.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was circulating his Ancient Strengthening Technique. He had just broke through to the 115th cycle a few days ago. Tough training for over the half a year's time had progressed his Ancient Strengthening Technique forward for ten cycles, and just in terms of his strength alone, he had increased by over two hundred thousand jin and 10% increment of his overall abilities. This was not a small number, and not something which the Small Revitalizing Pellet, which could increase one's overall abilities, could compare with. If one's abilities had no potential for further development, medicinal pills would only be able to increase 10% of what the person had at that point in time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui's current progress was different. While it seemed as if his overall abilities had improved by 10%, if he were to take more medicinal pills in the future, he would be able to further cumulate another 10% of his overall abilities.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Medicinal pills had their own advantages and disadvantages. The increments one experienced from taking medicinal pills were like they were forcefully enforced on them, and was not comparable to what one achieved through tough training and tempering. Another side effect of medicinal pills was that they would increase one's resistance to medicinal pills. If a person took too many of the same type of medicinal pills, even if they were of different grades, the effects provided would be diminished. The worst possible scenario would be clashing with the effects provided by another medicinal pill of the same grade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For example, if one took too many Small Revitalizing Pellets which was at the 1st level of King Grade, and develop a strong resistance to medicinal properties, in the future, even if they were to take medicinal pills which were of 1st level of King Grade or lower, there might be no effects.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For the past half a year, Qing Shui had been worrying about one thing - whether the people from the clan of the Xinan Medicinal King would come. Till today, Qing Shui had not been able to have a peace of mind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But no matter what, Qing Shui did not regret what he had done. For the past half a year, Qing Shui had visited Skysword Sect once, specially to check on Wenren Wu-shuang. This time round, Qing Shui's heart sank much deeper. The feelings between Wenren Wu-shuang and himself had grown increasing faint. While they were not complete strangers, they could only be considered friends.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As coolness once again covered that face with unparalleled beauty, Qing Shui started to feel that no matter what it was, nothing could withstand the trials of time, nor the changes to one's heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Circumstances change as time passes!" Qing Shui could not help but think of this line, although he knew that it was still not suitable for the situation now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Not long after Qing Shui had first sent Wenren Wu-shuang back to Skysword Sect back then, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li had already arrived at Hundred Miles City. Their great strength and unparalleled beauty astonished countless people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But it was also then did Qing Shui notice that Huoyun Liu-Li had regained her initial beauty, and had even become more beautiful than ever. He knew that she must have taken the Beauty Pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With the two ladies of unrivaled beauty coming to Qing Clan on a demonic beast, commotion once again broke out in Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Xiantian demonic beast!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What a beautiful lady! What has happened to Hundred Miles City?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"They don't lose out to that lady from Skysword Sect at all!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What beautiful and haughty women!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Yi noticed that her son was really all grown up. When Canghai Mingyue called her aunty, she was stunned. While their relationships with Qing Shui were not clear, she knew that it would definitely not be normal...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If she had to choose between the two of them as a wife for her son, Qing Yi would really not know who to choose. She had once told Qing Shui that as long as he had the ability to, he could bring back all the good women across the world of the nine continents. When she said this back then, it was only intended as an encouragement from a mother to the son she doted, hoping that he would gain happiness...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two ladies stayed in Hundred Miles City for only three days before they went back to Earthly Paradise. Shi Qingzhuang had also dropped by once during this time. Other than Shi Qingzhuang, as well as Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou, Qing Yi knew that there was that lady from Yu Clan who had not looked for Qing Shui. The four ladies together gave others the feeling of "a bunch of wild flowers confusing one's vision".</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were no fighting things, nor were they cordial. They only greeted each other politely, but looked towards Qing Shui with complicated gazes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui felt that it was as if he was half submerged in a volcano, half submerged in an ice cave. He knew that all four of them were deep in thought about something.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but reprimand himself for being such a player, reprimand himself for not knowing his limits. To have one of these ladies by his side was already something he should be grateful for to his ancestors for their blessings. But why did he still hold expectations?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All this time, Qing Shui had been struggling on this issue!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Letting out a sigh, Qing Shui picked up the Heaven Shaking Hammer. Ever since he brought it through to the obscure realm with the Thousand Hammer Technique, he had wanted to check out his present forging abilities. This time around, Qing Shui was overjoyed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">To think that the 2-color forging technique had broken through to the 2-color grade!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had thought about it many times, but not been able to achieve a breakthrough all this time, but when the Thousand Hammer Technique broke through to the obscure realm, he only thought of how domineering this technique was, and had forgotten that it was a technique for forging.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He took out the armor, boots and helmets which had accompanied him through the dangers back in Southern City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He went through all of them one by one, using the 2-color graded Thousand Hammer Technique to forge them all over again. Qing Shui was extremely satisfied with the the attributes which came out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Top armor, provide 20% increase in defense, only limited to protected areas; 250 increase in strength, 200 increase in endurance, 100 increase in agility! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bottom armor, provide 20% increase in defense, only limited to protected areas; 250 increase in strength, 200 increase in endurance, 100 increase in agility! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Helmet, provide 20% increase in defense, only limited to protected areas; 100 increase in strength, 100 increase in endurance, 100 increase in agility, 10 increase in energy! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">10 increase in energy?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the first time Qing Shui saw such an attribute. He thought of the Energy Fruit. Could it be that it increases one's Spiritual Sense? Or was it one's senses? Or would it increase one's spirit energy?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Take a look at the battle boots first. The effect of this 'energy' will be known in a while!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about it then looked towards the battle boots!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Battle boots, provide 20% increase in speed; 300 increase in strength, 100 increase in endurance, 200 increase in agility! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What Qing Shui was happy with was that the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength increased by 20%. To think that the forging technique which had increased to 2-color grade would be able to even cause the Frenzied Bull's Strength to increase by 20% as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the initially golden-colored battle armor, helmet, and battle boots now having a tinge of red in it, with an additional domineering aura. He thought of how the grades of armors and weapons were all ranked in terms of the colors, and the highest graded divine weapon was said to be a 7-colored graded one.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not wait and put on the set of armor. Immediately, a strong surge of energy came from it, making him want to let out a moan. It felt amazing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated the Frenzied Bull's Strength, and instantly felt the powers from the armor gradually merging with his Frenzied Bull's Strength. Immediately, the violent Frenzied Bull's Strength was as if it had transformed into a raging river, and the enhancement stunned Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Frenzied Bull's Strength which could increase one's strength by 30% now could increase his strength by 50%, another 20% more compared to the previous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Damn it, this is damn strong. Now the Frenzied Bull's Strength can just boost my strength by 50%..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but pick up the Heaven Shaking Hammer, and with his Nature Energy, a majestic force rose, making Qing Shui feel as if he could split a mountain at this very moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Performing the Thousand Hammer Technique which was at the Obscure Realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although his strength increased by quite a lot, with a total of 4,500,000 jin of tremendous strength, his defence had also improved by over 10%, and the increase in his speed also seemed to have rose tremendously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practiced for a whole two hours before he came to a stop!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Bangle."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed the bangle on his wrist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"How could I have forgotten about this? The bangle which can increase my destructive prowess? Destructive prowess could be comparable to one's strength to a certain degree."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took it off and forged it again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, he could only use his hand in place of the hammer, and it was more troublesome when he had to forge the armor which was the largest piece. This was truly what it meant to go through a thousand times of hammering and tempering. Qing Shui devoted all his focus to this, not even thinking about how many times he had hammered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ding!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When two radiant light rays appeared did Qing Shui then stop happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Similar to the two rays of light from earlier, they were of the two colors, red and yellow. Qing Shui knew that this bangle was forged successfully!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He quickly applied his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Damaging prowess increase by 20%, increase strength by 100, agility by 50, endurance by 50. Only one bangle can have any effect, no matter how many of them are worn.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After putting on the bangle, Qing Shui once again felt that violent and brute force. At the same time, a gush of blood surged to his brain. Such powers made one hot-tempered very easily. Qing Shui felt that if there was too much of this power, it could easily cause one to lose sense of who they are, and one might even end up killing the innocent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, currently the bangle's damaging prowess was only 20% and not yet sufficient to cause Qing Shui to lose himself. A suitable amount of damaging prowess would be able to bring about quite a good effect. However, it was a pity that such destructive prowess did not belong to him and was just an enhancement brought by the bangle. Therefore, too much of it could have a backlash effect to his consciousness, such as feeling extremely tired after a battle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taking off all the equipments and putting them aside, Qing Shui decided that he would not rely on external items unless there was no other way out. He still wanted to depend on his own abilities. "Tempering of the body" was the true essence of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before he left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui once again took a look at the fruit on the nameless branch. Half a year's time in the real work would mean seventy-five years to a plant in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He could already tell that it was a peach, and it was currently the size of his fist, looking green, yet sparkling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Each time Qing Shui looked at this, he would feel extremely delighted, because he was certain that it was the Peach of Immortality. It takes a hundred years to sprout roots, a hundred years to grow, a hundred years to blossom, a hundred years to fruit, a hundred years to mature. From the beginning till the end, he would need five hundred years.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After another two months, the Peach of Immortality would mature. He would only need to wait for the plant to flower, fruit and mature to get the next Peach of Immortality, taking only three hundred years, which would be the equivalent of two years in the real world.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">For the past half a year, Qing Shui had been worrying about one thing - whether the people from the clan of the Xinan Medicinal King would come. Till today, Qing Shui had not been able to have a peace of mind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But no matter what, Qing Shui did not regret what he had done. For the past half a year, Qing Shui had visited Skysword Sect once, specially to check on Wenren Wu-shuang. This time round, Qing Shui's heart sank much deeper. The feelings between Wenren Wu-shuang and himself had grown increasing faint. While they were not complete strangers, they could only be considered friends.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As coolness once again covered that face with unparalleled beauty, Qing Shui started to feel that no matter what it was, nothing could withstand the trials of time, nor the changes to one's heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Circumstances change as time passes!" Qing Shui could not help but think of this line, although he knew that it was still not suitable for the situation now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Not long after Qing Shui had first sent Wenren Wu-shuang back to Skysword Sect back then, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li had already arrived at Hundred Miles City. Their great strength and unparalleled beauty astonished countless people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But it was also then did Qing Shui notice that Huoyun Liu-Li had regained her initial beauty, and had even become more beautiful than ever. He knew that she must have taken the Beauty Pellet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With the two ladies of unrivaled beauty coming to Qing Clan on a demonic beast, commotion once again broke out in Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Xiantian demonic beast!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What a beautiful lady! What has happened to Hundred Miles City?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"They don't lose out to that lady from Skysword Sect at all!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What beautiful and haughty women!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Yi noticed that her son was really all grown up. When Canghai Mingyue called her aunty, she was stunned. While their relationships with Qing Shui were not clear, she knew that it would definitely not be normal...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If she had to choose between the two of them as a wife for her son, Qing Yi would really not know who to choose. She had once told Qing Shui that as long as he had the ability to, he could bring back all the good women across the world of the nine continents. When she said this back then, it was only intended as an encouragement from a mother to the son she doted, hoping that he would gain happiness...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two ladies stayed in Hundred Miles City for only three days before they went back to Earthly Paradise. Shi Qingzhuang had also dropped by once during this time. Other than Shi Qingzhuang, as well as Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou, Qing Yi knew that there was that lady from Yu Clan who had not looked for Qing Shui. The four ladies together gave others the feeling of "a bunch of wild flowers confusing one's vision".</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were no fighting things, nor were they cordial. They only greeted each other politely, but looked towards Qing Shui with complicated gazes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui felt that it was as if he was half submerged in a volcano, half submerged in an ice cave. He knew that all four of them were deep in thought about something.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but reprimand himself for being such a player, reprimand himself for not knowing his limits. To have one of these ladies by his side was already something he should be grateful for to his ancestors for their blessings. But why did he still hold expectations?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All this time, Qing Shui had been struggling on this issue!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Letting out a sigh, Qing Shui picked up the Heaven Shaking Hammer. Ever since he brought it through to the obscure realm with the Thousand Hammer Technique, he had wanted to check out his present forging abilities. This time around, Qing Shui was overjoyed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">To think that the 2-color forging technique had broken through to the 2-color grade!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had thought about it many times, but not been able to achieve a breakthrough all this time, but when the Thousand Hammer Technique broke through to the obscure realm, he only thought of how domineering this technique was, and had forgotten that it was a technique for forging.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He took out the armor, boots and helmets which had accompanied him through the dangers back in Southern City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He went through all of them one by one, using the 2-color graded Thousand Hammer Technique to forge them all over again. Qing Shui was extremely satisfied with the the attributes which came out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Top armor, provide 20% increase in defense, only limited to protected areas; 250 increase in strength, 200 increase in endurance, 100 increase in agility! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bottom armor, provide 20% increase in defense, only limited to protected areas; 250 increase in strength, 200 increase in endurance, 100 increase in agility! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Helmet, provide 20% increase in defense, only limited to protected areas; 100 increase in strength, 100 increase in endurance, 100 increase in agility, 10 increase in energy! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">10 increase in energy?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the first time Qing Shui saw such an attribute. He thought of the Energy Fruit. Could it be that it increases one's Spiritual Sense? Or was it one's senses? Or would it increase one's spirit energy?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Take a look at the battle boots first. The effect of this 'energy' will be known in a while!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about it then looked towards the battle boots!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Battle boots, provide 20% increase in speed; 300 increase in strength, 100 increase in endurance, 200 increase in agility! Enhanced the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength by 20%, and would only take effect when equipped with at least three armors or weapons with similar attributes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What Qing Shui was happy with was that the effects of the Frenzied Bull's Strength increased by 20%. To think that the forging technique which had increased to 2-color grade would be able to even cause the Frenzied Bull's Strength to increase by 20% as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the initially golden-colored battle armor, helmet, and battle boots now having a tinge of red in it, with an additional domineering aura. He thought of how the grades of armors and weapons were all ranked in terms of the colors, and the highest graded divine weapon was said to be a 7-colored graded one.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not wait and put on the set of armor. Immediately, a strong surge of energy came from it, making him want to let out a moan. It felt amazing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated the Frenzied Bull's Strength, and instantly felt the powers from the armor gradually merging with his Frenzied Bull's Strength. Immediately, the violent Frenzied Bull's Strength was as if it had transformed into a raging river, and the enhancement stunned Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Frenzied Bull's Strength which could increase one's strength by 30% now could increase his strength by 50%, another 20% more compared to the previous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Damn it, this is damn strong. Now the Frenzied Bull's Strength can just boost my strength by 50%..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but pick up the Heaven Shaking Hammer, and with his Nature Energy, a majestic force rose, making Qing Shui feel as if he could split a mountain at this very moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Performing the Thousand Hammer Technique which was at the Obscure Realm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although his strength increased by quite a lot, with a total of 4,500,000 jin of tremendous strength, his defence had also improved by over 10%, and the increase in his speed also seemed to have rose tremendously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practiced for a whole two hours before he came to a stop!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Bangle."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed the bangle on his wrist!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"How could I have forgotten about this? The bangle which can increase my destructive prowess? Destructive prowess could be comparable to one's strength to a certain degree."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took it off and forged it again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, he could only use his hand in place of the hammer, and it was more troublesome when he had to forge the armor which was the largest piece. This was truly what it meant to go through a thousand times of hammering and tempering. Qing Shui devoted all his focus to this, not even thinking about how many times he had hammered.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ding!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When two radiant light rays appeared did Qing Shui then stop happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Similar to the two rays of light from earlier, they were of the two colors, red and yellow. Qing Shui knew that this bangle was forged successfully!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He quickly applied his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Damaging prowess increase by 20%, increase strength by 100, agility by 50, endurance by 50. Only one bangle can have any effect, no matter how many of them are worn.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After putting on the bangle, Qing Shui once again felt that violent and brute force. At the same time, a gush of blood surged to his brain. Such powers made one hot-tempered very easily. Qing Shui felt that if there was too much of this power, it could easily cause one to lose sense of who they are, and one might even end up killing the innocent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, currently the bangle's damaging prowess was only 20% and not yet sufficient to cause Qing Shui to lose himself. A suitable amount of damaging prowess would be able to bring about quite a good effect. However, it was a pity that such destructive prowess did not belong to him and was just an enhancement brought by the bangle. Therefore, too much of it could have a backlash effect to his consciousness, such as feeling extremely tired after a battle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Taking off all the equipments and putting them aside, Qing Shui decided that he would not rely on external items unless there was no other way out. He still wanted to depend on his own abilities. "Tempering of the body" was the true essence of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Before he left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui once again took a look at the fruit on the nameless branch. Half a year's time in the real work would mean seventy-five years to a plant in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He could already tell that it was a peach, and it was currently the size of his fist, looking green, yet sparkling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Each time Qing Shui looked at this, he would feel extremely delighted, because he was certain that it was the Peach of Immortality. It takes a hundred years to sprout roots, a hundred years to grow, a hundred years to blossom, a hundred years to fruit, a hundred years to mature. From the beginning till the end, he would need five hundred years.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After another two months, the Peach of Immortality would mature. He would only need to wait for the plant to flower, fruit and mature to get the next Peach of Immortality, taking only three hundred years, which would be the equivalent of two years in the real world.</p>
