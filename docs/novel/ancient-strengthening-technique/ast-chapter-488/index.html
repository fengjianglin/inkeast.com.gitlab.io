 <p><strong>Chapter 488 .</strong></p>
 <div class="innerContent fr-view" id="chapterContent">
  <p><br></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 488 - Sword of Fifth Wave! Kill!</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Right at the moment when Qing Shui’s shield attack clashed against the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger, Lin Yuchen’s body suddenly moved horizontally by ten meters. He only barely dodged it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was yet another loud clash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The short wailing noise instantly disappeared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The blood of the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger spread out and covered the whole sky. Even a powerful demonic beast would be scattered and smashed by this attack.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Lin Yuchen has already dropped down to the back of the Fire Bird.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart thumped, he definitely couldn’t afford to be bound by him. He ordered the Fire bird to continue soaring up at a high speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Yuchen got shocked. After all, the flying beast under his feet wasn’t his own. The higher it flew, the more dangerous it would be, hence he must let go of it. He looked underneath and saw a lot of small black dots rushing towards him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He immediately felt a sense of relief. But he still needed to stop the Red Luan from flying upwards.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Fire Bird wailed. Even though it was still soaring up the sky, it was a lot slower than before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It turned out that Lin Yuchen exerted all of his strength to step on the back of the Fire Bird. He didn’t dare to use too much strength as he was only attempting to hurt it. This way, it would cause the Fire Bird to fly a bit slower while keeping Qing Shui alive. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui observed Lin Yuchen’s action, he felt enraged and hurt. He abruptly struck the Big Dipper Sword in his hand at Lin Yuchen. Qing Shui subconsciously used his currently most powerful continuous attacks.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fourth Wave!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s an attack of continuous waves!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that instant, the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint in the Thousand Buddha Grottoes flashed across Qing Shui’s mind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng-beng-beng-beng-peng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. The Sword of Fourth Wave that he subconsciously used had actually made another breakthrough at this very moment. It straight away turned into five heavy waves.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the last strike still proved to be quite a challenge, but the previous four waves had shown clear signs that they ascended by one huge grade.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most importantly, when it was used with Qing Shui’s current strength, it’s power was totally different from before. It was something that was on absolutely different terms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment when both Lin Yuchen’s and Qing Shui’s sword clashed, Lin Yuchen’s expression instantly changed. At that moment, he realized how powerful the young man in front of him had actually become. At first, he thought that his opponent’s previous attack was out of a hurry by borrowing the strength and speed of the Red Luan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, he knew that he has made a huge mistake. A really, really huge mistake. Unfortunately, it’s too late now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The formidable Sword of Fifth Wave directly attacked him. It was so strong that he got blown backwards. A big mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was still immersed in the thought that he just brokethrough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Sword of Fifth Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was a bit stunned by the accidental joy. Even though there was only one more wave compared to before, but the difference in strength was too great!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was also the power of the heavy waves. It's just that it tend to consume a lot of energy when cultivating it. At that time, Qing Shui almost died on the Sword of Second Wave! From here, one could already tell just how powerful the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Sword of Fifth Wave was the most crucial turning point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the man falling to the ground and he knew that it’s already impossible for him to survive. The people below were riding their Flying Beast and seeing if they could grab him so that at least his corpse would remain intact. If they have waited for a bit longer, there would be no longer anyone who dared to grab him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of his organs has been shattered by the shockwave. There’s no way for him to be alive even if he had wanted to!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the enormous flying beasts beneath let out air cutting noises. Qing Shui took a look at the Fire Bird that was injured. Even though the damage was quite light, it could no longer be used to forcefully clash against the enemies.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He let the Fire Bird flew outwards!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The advantage of being in mid-air was that there were a lot of escape routes. It could fly higher and higher. As long as it had speed, the opponents would be unable to surround and kill it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He threw a Five Dragon Pellet into the Fire Bird’s mouth. It was better than doing nothing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, the Fire Bird’s speed was obviously slower than before. The man’s intention was to keep him alive. With his strength that was significantly greater than the Fire Bird’s, if it wasn't because they were high up in the air, Qing Shui was convinced that he would have been able to destroy the Fire Bird with just one kick.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After flying five hundred miles, Qing Shui noticed that the Fire Bird was at its limit. It needed to be treated. Seeing as the surrounding areas were forest and mountains, Qing Shui made the Fire bird lower its speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Quick! The Red Luan is injured!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Catch up to that kid! Wait for Mr Gong Qi to come over!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We must stop him!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Fei Sanyuan! Where is your poison? Use it quickly!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As soon as Qing Shui descended to the ground, he immediately put the Fire Bird back into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. After that, he took out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on the Overlord Storm and immediately put on a Gale Talisman! He also ordered the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to charge into the thick forest with large trees.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When one’s there, flying beasts could basically be considered useless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But the forest was quite far away from him. And most importantly, the flying beasts in the air had also begun to surround them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiu-xiu…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s continuously shot up the stones into the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were some that got blinded after being shot by it whereas some unlucky ones died from being hit in the brain. Other than the three that died, the other four were saved by other flying beasts nearby.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the people and the Demonic beasts on the ground had also rushed over.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued to make his way into the mountains. The Diamond Gigantic Beast also pushed away a few of the surrounding Demonic beasts. But the large tiger that worried Qing Shui the most had yet to appear. This made Qing Shui feel really concerned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has witnessed the speed of the tiger before. Since the rest of the demonic beasts that moved on their limbs had arrived, logically, the large tiger should have been here too.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui released his Spiritual Sense!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that instant, Qing Shui felt a bit of movement behind a rock to his left. That large stone was three hundred meters away from Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three hundred meters, yet to Qing Shui, it all felt like it happened in a blink of an eye, the enormous Golden Spiritual Tiger charged into the Diamond Gigantic Elephant which was still running from the side at a speed faster than the wind. Qing Shui only just managed to block with the Violet Gold Divine Shield in time.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He didn't even get to use the Shield Attack!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a depressing loud noise.Qing Shui brought along the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and immediately flung flying outwards!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui was feeling incomparably shocked. Simultaneously, he was also worried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This speed of this silver white colored enormous Golden Spiritual Tiger could actually be fast to this extent. Most importantly, its defense was also extremely powerful and it possessed an offensive strength of approximately seven countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it hadn't been for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant blocking more than half of the attack, he would have gotten injured by just that one strike. Things would be even worse if the attack directly landed on his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And he was still only talking about it with the Seven Stars Armor on!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before Qing Shui came back to his senses, the enormous tiger has already charged towards him once again with a huge force.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Damn it, what's there to be proud of just because you are a bit fast and strong!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui countered with the Violet Gold Divide Shield instantly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He blocked it in time. Its speed was so fast that Qing Shui could only do it subconsciously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, the enormous Golden Spiritual Tiger got blown away directly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt particularly good.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Gong Qi who was sitting on top of the Golden Spiritual Hurricane Tiger Beast got so frightened that he turned pale. He knew better than anyone else just how strong the Old Ancestor’s Golden Spiritual Hurricane Tiger Beast was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seven countries worth of offensive strength, Seven countries worth of defensive strength, even its speed was out indescribable! Some of the three or four countries worth Demonic Beast in the pinnacle of Martial King stage would be killed in an instant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, the brat in front of him had actually managed to hurt it to the point it got blown away. Even he himself was affected by the shockwave to the point he spewed out blood. But he looked on to see as if nothing seemed to affect the young man in the distance, so much that it didn't even cause him to go back by one step…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Gong Qi felt relieved when he saw the Golden Spiritual Hurricane Tiger Beast uninjured. He fixed his sight at the large shield in Qing Shui’s hand which was shining with a violet and golden light.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it have something to do with that shield?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was surrounded. He was surrounded by no less than a hundred of men that were both on and off Demonic beasts. It seemed that these sects must have really looked up to him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The majority of the people were from Sword Tower and Demonic Beast Sect. They accounted for a total of sixty percent of them. For the remaining people, Qing Shui could already tell where they were from by looking at their costumes. There were actually people from a total of ten clans!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No one was seen wearing costumes from Qin Clan and Hai Clan. However, there were a few that came from Academy of Demon Refinery.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a fragrant smell which was initially faint and later grew stronger started to spread out around here.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Damn it! Fei Sanyuan! Give me the cure! You gave it to everyone else but me! Are you trying to kill me!?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You were poisoned by my ‘Immortal Drunkness’ and yet you are still so cocky?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A sloppy-looking middle-aged man laughed as he said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Third brother? Third grandpa? I know I'm wrong now!” The middle-aged man from before said with his face puckered up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Catch!” Fei Sanyuan threw a green colored medicinal pull to the middle-aged man from before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The only thing that Qing Shui felt was an unusual fragrance that rushed into his nose. He felt dizzy. But in an instant, the fresh odour started operating on its own and very quickly, it canceled out the discomfort that he felt earlier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui grinned, he has actually forgotten about this.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For safety purpose, Qing Shui quickly took out two Five Dragon Pellet. He swallowed one himself and made the Diamond Gigantic Elephant swallowed the other one.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment when Qing Shui swallowed the medicinal pill, the enormous tiger once again charged into Qing Shui like a flash of light! This time, the strong middle-aged man, the man that looked tall and mighty with muscles that resembled those of a T-Rex chopped down his sword at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under the Shield Attack, as long as it was not an absolute power, it would be capable of hitting you until you fly!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In that instant, Qing Shui released the Shield Attack with his left hand while grabbing a Binding Talisman in his right hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, even though it successfully blasted the enemy back, Qing Shui and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was also blasted backwards. Furthermore, it had also caused Qing Shui’s blood and Qi to surge violently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The combined attack of the man from before and the enormous tiger had already exceeded the strength of his second grade Shield Attack. It was just that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant happened to be there, so it only canceled each other out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under the second grade Shield Attack, Qing Shui’s power level barely made it to six countries worth of offensive strength. However, it was unable to destroy the defense of the large tiger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the uninjured tiger in the distance and immediately felt a bit helpless about it. Not only was it really fast, both its offensive and defensive strength were this formidable…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was unable to destroy its defense. The situation would just be less and less favorable to him if this went on any longer.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For example, at the moment when the enormous tiger initiated an attack, the people in the surroundings were also attacking Qing Shui. Arrows, poisons, misleading fogs and the internal attacks of the Demonic Beasts…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a look at the sky. Soon, really soon!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui was too exhausted to fight. He didn't have any offensive ability left. He could only defend and this was definitely not a solution!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After holding on for about a quarter of an hour, Qing Shui immediately disappeared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the Diamond Gigantic Elephant also disappeared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was already the second day. The entrance to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was available once again.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hence, Qing Shui grasped the opportunity and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal without any hesitation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Where is he?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it be Shrinking Ruler?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why didn't he use it previously? I suspect that it's a deceptive trick which is used by the assassins!” Said an old man wearing the Alchemist Sect attire.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This happened before, everybody, take turns to guard this place, there should be a time limit!” Gong Qi said suddenly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was laying on the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He thought over it and concluded that he only had two options. The first one was to wait for the Fire Bird to heal, then leave by riding on it. But he knew that the possibility was really small. He reckoned that there would definitely be flying beasts which could stop him outside after he went out.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 488 - Sword of Fifth Wave! Kill!</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Right at the moment when Qing Shui’s shield attack clashed against the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger, Lin Yuchen’s body suddenly moved horizontally by ten meters. He only barely dodged it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was yet another loud clash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The short wailing noise instantly disappeared.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The blood of the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger spread out and covered the whole sky. Even a powerful demonic beast would be scattered and smashed by this attack.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Lin Yuchen has already dropped down to the back of the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart thumped, he definitely couldn’t afford to be bound by him. He ordered the Fire bird to continue soaring up at a high speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lin Yuchen got shocked. After all, the flying beast under his feet wasn’t his own. The higher it flew, the more dangerous it would be, hence he must let go of it. He looked underneath and saw a lot of small black dots rushing towards him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He immediately felt a sense of relief. But he still needed to stop the Red Luan from flying upwards.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Fire Bird wailed. Even though it was still soaring up the sky, it was a lot slower than before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It turned out that Lin Yuchen exerted all of his strength to step on the back of the Fire Bird. He didn’t dare to use too much strength as he was only attempting to hurt it. This way, it would cause the Fire Bird to fly a bit slower while keeping Qing Shui alive. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui observed Lin Yuchen’s action, he felt enraged and hurt. He abruptly struck the Big Dipper Sword in his hand at Lin Yuchen. Qing Shui subconsciously used his currently most powerful continuous attacks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fourth Wave!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s an attack of continuous waves!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that instant, the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint in the Thousand Buddha Grottoes flashed across Qing Shui’s mind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng-beng-beng-beng-peng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. The Sword of Fourth Wave that he subconsciously used had actually made another breakthrough at this very moment. It straight away turned into five heavy waves.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the last strike still proved to be quite a challenge, but the previous four waves had shown clear signs that they ascended by one huge grade.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most importantly, when it was used with Qing Shui’s current strength, it’s power was totally different from before. It was something that was on absolutely different terms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment when both Lin Yuchen’s and Qing Shui’s sword clashed, Lin Yuchen’s expression instantly changed. At that moment, he realized how powerful the young man in front of him had actually become. At first, he thought that his opponent’s previous attack was out of a hurry by borrowing the strength and speed of the Red Luan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But now, he knew that he has made a huge mistake. A really, really huge mistake. Unfortunately, it’s too late now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The formidable Sword of Fifth Wave directly attacked him. It was so strong that he got blown backwards. A big mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was still immersed in the thought that he just brokethrough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Sword of Fifth Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was a bit stunned by the accidental joy. Even though there was only one more wave compared to before, but the difference in strength was too great!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was also the power of the heavy waves. It's just that it tend to consume a lot of energy when cultivating it. At that time, Qing Shui almost died on the Sword of Second Wave! From here, one could already tell just how powerful the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Sword of Fifth Wave was the most crucial turning point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the man falling to the ground and he knew that it’s already impossible for him to survive. The people below were riding their Flying Beast and seeing if they could grab him so that at least his corpse would remain intact. If they have waited for a bit longer, there would be no longer anyone who dared to grab him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of his organs has been shattered by the shockwave. There’s no way for him to be alive even if he had wanted to!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the enormous flying beasts beneath let out air cutting noises. Qing Shui took a look at the Fire Bird that was injured. Even though the damage was quite light, it could no longer be used to forcefully clash against the enemies.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He let the Fire Bird flew outwards!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The advantage of being in mid-air was that there were a lot of escape routes. It could fly higher and higher. As long as it had speed, the opponents would be unable to surround and kill it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He threw a Five Dragon Pellet into the Fire Bird’s mouth. It was better than doing nothing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, the Fire Bird’s speed was obviously slower than before. The man’s intention was to keep him alive. With his strength that was significantly greater than the Fire Bird’s, if it wasn't because they were high up in the air, Qing Shui was convinced that he would have been able to destroy the Fire Bird with just one kick.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After flying five hundred miles, Qing Shui noticed that the Fire Bird was at its limit. It needed to be treated. Seeing as the surrounding areas were forest and mountains, Qing Shui made the Fire bird lower its speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Quick! The Red Luan is injured!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Catch up to that kid! Wait for Mr Gong Qi to come over!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We must stop him!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Fei Sanyuan! Where is your poison? Use it quickly!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As soon as Qing Shui descended to the ground, he immediately put the Fire Bird back into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. After that, he took out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on the Overlord Storm and immediately put on a Gale Talisman! He also ordered the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to charge into the thick forest with large trees.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When one’s there, flying beasts could basically be considered useless.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But the forest was quite far away from him. And most importantly, the flying beasts in the air had also begun to surround them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Xiu-xiu…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s continuously shot up the stones into the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were some that got blinded after being shot by it whereas some unlucky ones died from being hit in the brain. Other than the three that died, the other four were saved by other flying beasts nearby.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the people and the Demonic beasts on the ground had also rushed over.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued to make his way into the mountains. The Diamond Gigantic Beast also pushed away a few of the surrounding Demonic beasts. But the large tiger that worried Qing Shui the most had yet to appear. This made Qing Shui feel really concerned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has witnessed the speed of the tiger before. Since the rest of the demonic beasts that moved on their limbs had arrived, logically, the large tiger should have been here too.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui released his Spiritual Sense!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that instant, Qing Shui felt a bit of movement behind a rock to his left. That large stone was three hundred meters away from Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Three hundred meters, yet to Qing Shui, it all felt like it happened in a blink of an eye, the enormous Golden Spiritual Tiger charged into the Diamond Gigantic Elephant which was still running from the side at a speed faster than the wind. Qing Shui only just managed to block with the Violet Gold Divine Shield in time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He didn't even get to use the Shield Attack!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a depressing loud noise.Qing Shui brought along the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and immediately flung flying outwards!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui was feeling incomparably shocked. Simultaneously, he was also worried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This speed of this silver white colored enormous Golden Spiritual Tiger could actually be fast to this extent. Most importantly, its defense was also extremely powerful and it possessed an offensive strength of approximately seven countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If it hadn't been for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant blocking more than half of the attack, he would have gotten injured by just that one strike. Things would be even worse if the attack directly landed on his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And he was still only talking about it with the Seven Stars Armor on!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Before Qing Shui came back to his senses, the enormous tiger has already charged towards him once again with a huge force.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Damn it, what's there to be proud of just because you are a bit fast and strong!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui countered with the Violet Gold Divide Shield instantly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He blocked it in time. Its speed was so fast that Qing Shui could only do it subconsciously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, the enormous Golden Spiritual Tiger got blown away directly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt particularly good.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Gong Qi who was sitting on top of the Golden Spiritual Hurricane Tiger Beast got so frightened that he turned pale. He knew better than anyone else just how strong the Old Ancestor’s Golden Spiritual Hurricane Tiger Beast was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seven countries worth of offensive strength, Seven countries worth of defensive strength, even its speed was out indescribable! Some of the three or four countries worth Demonic Beast in the pinnacle of Martial King stage would be killed in an instant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, the brat in front of him had actually managed to hurt it to the point it got blown away. Even he himself was affected by the shockwave to the point he spewed out blood. But he looked on to see as if nothing seemed to affect the young man in the distance, so much that it didn't even cause him to go back by one step…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Gong Qi felt relieved when he saw the Golden Spiritual Hurricane Tiger Beast uninjured. He fixed his sight at the large shield in Qing Shui’s hand which was shining with a violet and golden light.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could it have something to do with that shield?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was surrounded. He was surrounded by no less than a hundred of men that were both on and off Demonic beasts. It seemed that these sects must have really looked up to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The majority of the people were from Sword Tower and Demonic Beast Sect. They accounted for a total of sixty percent of them. For the remaining people, Qing Shui could already tell where they were from by looking at their costumes. There were actually people from a total of ten clans!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No one was seen wearing costumes from Qin Clan and Hai Clan. However, there were a few that came from Academy of Demon Refinery.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a fragrant smell which was initially faint and later grew stronger started to spread out around here.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Damn it! Fei Sanyuan! Give me the cure! You gave it to everyone else but me! Are you trying to kill me!?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You were poisoned by my ‘Immortal Drunkness’ and yet you are still so cocky?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A sloppy-looking middle-aged man laughed as he said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Third brother? Third grandpa? I know I'm wrong now!” The middle-aged man from before said with his face puckered up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Catch!” Fei Sanyuan threw a green colored medicinal pull to the middle-aged man from before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The only thing that Qing Shui felt was an unusual fragrance that rushed into his nose. He felt dizzy. But in an instant, the fresh odour started operating on its own and very quickly, it canceled out the discomfort that he felt earlier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui grinned, he has actually forgotten about this.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For safety purpose, Qing Shui quickly took out two Five Dragon Pellet. He swallowed one himself and made the Diamond Gigantic Elephant swallowed the other one.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment when Qing Shui swallowed the medicinal pill, the enormous tiger once again charged into Qing Shui like a flash of light! This time, the strong middle-aged man, the man that looked tall and mighty with muscles that resembled those of a T-Rex chopped down his sword at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under the Shield Attack, as long as it was not an absolute power, it would be capable of hitting you until you fly!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In that instant, Qing Shui released the Shield Attack with his left hand while grabbing a Binding Talisman in his right hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, even though it successfully blasted the enemy back, Qing Shui and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was also blasted backwards. Furthermore, it had also caused Qing Shui’s blood and Qi to surge violently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The combined attack of the man from before and the enormous tiger had already exceeded the strength of his second grade Shield Attack. It was just that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant happened to be there, so it only canceled each other out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under the second grade Shield Attack, Qing Shui’s power level barely made it to six countries worth of offensive strength. However, it was unable to destroy the defense of the large tiger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the uninjured tiger in the distance and immediately felt a bit helpless about it. Not only was it really fast, both its offensive and defensive strength were this formidable…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was unable to destroy its defense. The situation would just be less and less favorable to him if this went on any longer.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For example, at the moment when the enormous tiger initiated an attack, the people in the surroundings were also attacking Qing Shui. Arrows, poisons, misleading fogs and the internal attacks of the Demonic Beasts…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a look at the sky. Soon, really soon!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui was too exhausted to fight. He didn't have any offensive ability left. He could only defend and this was definitely not a solution!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After holding on for about a quarter of an hour, Qing Shui immediately disappeared.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the Diamond Gigantic Elephant also disappeared.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was already the second day. The entrance to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was available once again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hence, Qing Shui grasped the opportunity and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal without any hesitation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Where is he?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could it be Shrinking Ruler?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why didn't he use it previously? I suspect that it's a deceptive trick which is used by the assassins!” Said an old man wearing the Alchemist Sect attire.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This happened before, everybody, take turns to guard this place, there should be a time limit!” Gong Qi said suddenly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was laying on the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He thought over it and concluded that he only had two options. The first one was to wait for the Fire Bird to heal, then leave by riding on it. But he knew that the possibility was really small. He reckoned that there would definitely be flying beasts which could stop him outside after he went out.</p>
