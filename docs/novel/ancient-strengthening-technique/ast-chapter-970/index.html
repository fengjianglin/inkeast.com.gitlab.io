 <p><strong>AST 970 - Sons must be raised poorly, while Daughters must be raised richly</strong></p>
 <p>Everyone laughed and headed inside. Everyone was in a great mood because of Qing Shui's return. Cang Wuya and the others knew that Qing Shui must be tired since he had just returned. Thus, they didn't come over immediately. They decided to give Qing Shui some time to reunite with his family before coming over the next day. Or maybe Qing Shui would go over.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>Qin Yin called out for Qing Shui softly. Three years was sufficient for her to feel distant toward her father. It wasn't only for her but for the others as well. Especially in the case of Qing Ming and Qing Yan, who had almost zero recollection of Qing Shui. Qing Zun and Qin Yin had a least some impression of Qing Shui, but they still felt a little distant from him.</p>
 <p>"Lass, come!" Qing Shui grasped one of her hands and the young lass smiled happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's heart warmed up from her smile. This was his own daughter. Although he had treated Luan Luan and Yuchang as if they were his own children or even closer, this moment still felt especially touching. It should be due to their blood connection.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, another small hand reached out towards his other hand. Qing Shui saw that it was Qing Yan. The beautiful little girl smiled and called out to him, "Father!"</p>
 <p>"Good girl!" Qing Shui carried her.</p>
 <p>Qing Yan was very similar to Shi Qingzhuang but wasn't as cold as her. Her exquisite little face was like that of a porcelain doll's. Carrying a daughter in one hand while holding the hand of another made him feel a great sense of achievement.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, why do you only care about your daughters? You still have two sons." Di Qing smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"A true man must be able to hold up the world. In the future, you must protect your sisters and always give in to them. We're all true men." Qing Ming smiled and said to Qing Zun and Qing Ming.</p>
 <p>The others were speechless. Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui and said, "Careful that you don't spoil your daughters."</p>
 <p>"That's right, Qing Shui, you can't spoil your children like this." Canghai Mingyue added, not really smiling.</p>
 <p>"Daughters are meant to be spoilt, while sons are meant to be beaten." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qin Yin laughed softly, while Luan Luan spoke out with a crisp laughter, "Father is the best. What father says is absolute. Don't you think so, Yuchang?"</p>
 <p>"Elder sister said just what I wanted to say. It's totally right. I support what elder sister says." Having spent a long time with Luan Luan, Yuchang also grew a little sly.</p>
 <p>Qing Zun didn't felt anything but Qing Ming pouted. As for Qing Yu, she was still too young, she didn't show any reaction to Qing Shui's words. She was only interested in the fruits that she was holding.</p>
 <p>Looking at them, Qing Shui felt a great sense of satisfaction that he hadn't felt before. They said that sons must be raised poorly while daughters must be raised richly. For boys, one must give them a sense of danger from a young age. Only then would they constantly remember that they would need to strive upward and work hard.</p>
 <p>And as for girls, one must do their best to give them whatever they wished. Only then would they be hard to deceive when they grew up. Qing Shui recalled how some girls in his previous life were able to sell themselves for things that were only worth tens of dollars. At least a rich young lady wouldn't sell themselves for the sake of money or items. This was why daughters must be raised with a rich life.</p>
 <p>"Father!" Qin Yin lifted her head and called out again.</p>
 <p>It was only this time around that Qing Shui felt that this lass was being a bit strange. He took her hand and asked, "What does Yin`er want to say? Father will fulfill all of your wishes. I've been busy for the past few years and haven't been able to take good care of you."</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw his daughter's intelligent looking eyes, he was also stunned. Yin`er was very similar to Canghai Mingyue and was very collected despite her age. However, she was looking at him curiously. This was to be expected. After all, a father had suddenly appeared before her.</p>
 <p>"I also want father to carry me!" Qin Yin said a bit shyly.</p>
 <p>"That's easy. You're my daughter. Even if you wanted the moon in the sky, I'll find a way to pluck it down for you." Qing Shui bent down and carried her up.</p>
 <p>Looking at this scene, Canghai Mingyue continued to smile faintly. However, the blissful glow in her eyes became brighter than before.</p>
 <p>They arrived at the hall soon after. Almost everyone in Qing Clan was here. Thankfully, the hall was large enough. Qing Shui knew that he would need to share what he had been through and thus began to talk naturally.</p>
 <p>He even brought up the matters involving Mu Qing and Hai Dongqing. However, he didn't say anything about Lady Duanmu and the lady in the crystal coffin. For now, he didn't bring up the matter of Yu He either.</p>
 <p>"Our husband is very capable. Thankfully it's only two, a bit fewer than what we guessed." Huoyun Liu-Li chuckled.</p>
 <p>When he heard Huoyun Liu-Li's words, Qing Shui asked gloomily, "How many did you guys guess?"</p>
 <p>"We guessed that there would be four. At least four." Mingyue Gelou also smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed with them but was secretly astonished. If he counted Yu He and Lady Duanmu, wouldn't there be four? As for Di Qing, they should have already have counted her as one of them...</p>
 <p>The more the few ladies didn't blame Qing Shui, the more burdened he felt. In the end, he said to them helplessly. "Am I a real bastard? To think that I don't know how to feel content even when I have you guys with me."</p>
 <p>"Yes, you're really quite a bastard. In the past, I was quite worried that you wouldn't be able to get a wife when you grew up. I guess that I was wrong." Qing Yi smiled and said helplessly. Although she said this, she didn't really blame Qing Shui. A mother was the most understanding toward her own children and it could even be said that there would always be some spoiling involved. She would be even happier if her son was able to marry all the good women in the world.</p>
 <p>"When we've decided to be with you, we've never thought that we would be able to keep you to ourselves. There's no need for you to feel guilty either. If you have time, just spend more with our kids. Yin`er often thinks about you."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the quiet daughter in his arms. He felt especially happy and satisfied to be looking at this beautiful young girl. On his other arm, Qing Yan was eating something and would also look at Qing Shui with her big blinking eyes.</p>
 <p>"Father, fruit..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Qing Yu, who was grabbing his leg. She stared at Qing Shui with her clear crystal-like eyes. Kids were very simple-minded. They would become close with anyone who had food.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui naturally fulfilled this request and gave her a small bag. It was a pity that she didn't have the strength to hold it. She then squeezed into Qing Shui's arms, found a comfortable spot, and started eating...</p>
 <p>Qin Yin got off and carried Qing Yu, passing her to Qing Shui. The little lass smiled happily as she ate the fruits. Qing Shui dotingly patted her head.</p>
 <p>"I can tell what you guys want from your gaze. Catch it. Go split it up amongst yourselves." Qing Shui smiled and tossed Qing Bei an interspatial silk sachet.</p>
 <p>Qing Yu and the others happily received the sachet and then extolled Qing Shui, who didn't know whether he should laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>After three plus years had passed, the improvements of the people in Qing Clan were quite big. Canghai Mingyue and the others hadn't slacked at cultivating either. Both Yiye Jiange and Canghai Mingyue were Peak Martial Saints, about the same as Di Qing previously. Right now, the two of them only lacked a weapon.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou, on the other hand, surprised Qing Shui. She now had the strength of two stars. However, she was trained in the Tiger Form and didn't require any weapons. This was something which made Qing Shui feel helpless before he suddenly recalled a weapon that she could use.</p>
 <p>Gloves or claws!</p>
 <p>He didn't know what level Mingyue Gelou's Tiger Form was at but he had a feeling that it might match his. This was only a feeling. Qing Shui had attained a greater level of achievement with his abilities, while Mingyue Gelou had done so through her comprehension. Her level of comprehension was related to the fact that she was born with all her meridian channels cleared.</p>
 <p>Shi Qingzhuang was now a Grade Ten Martial King as well. Huoyun Liu-Li was a Peak Martial King with the strength of ten countries. Qing Bei was also a Grade Ten Martial King, Qing Hui was a Grade One Martial King, Qing Hu was a Grade Three Martial King, Qing You was a Grade Eight Martial King, Qing Zi was a Grade Six Martial King, Qingqing was a Grade Eight Martial King... Unknowingly, the Qing Clan's abilities had begun to stand out.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan was the limelight amongst the fourth generation, stunning even Qing Shui. Luan Luan was now a Grade Eight Martial Saint. This was also the reason that Qing Shui felt that it would be safe when he left. Luan Luan could stand her ground here.</p>
 <p>At her level, it would usually be harder to raise her cultivation level. However, Luan Luan's advancement continued to be smooth sailing. The Heart of Seven Orifices was truly very powerful. Within three to five years at most, she would become a Martial Emperor. The only flaw in this was her short lifespan. When she reached the early stages of Martial Emperor, she would have spent at least three quarters of her lifespan. This was a sort of balance. However, since she had a father like Qing Shui, there wasn't a need to worry about her lifespan.</p>
 <p>"Very soon, this daughter of mine will be able to share my troubles with me." Qing Shui felt consoled.</p>
 <p>He wondered how Wenren Wu-shuang and Di Chen were doing. He hadn't seen them for very long, and just as he was thinking about this, Qing Yi spoke up.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I have something to discuss with you."</p>
 <p>"Mother, feel free to just say it. It sounds like something major." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>He saw that Qingqing seemed to be a little unnatural and thought of something.</p>
 <p>"The Guo Clan came to ask for Qingqing's hand in marriage. It's that Guo Polu." Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could never forget the pain that Qingqing had gone through in the past. If not for Guo Polu, she would have had it much worse. He had always remembered this name and this time around, he had also planned on helping Guo Clan.</p>
 <p>"Sister, no matter if Qing Clan is strong or weak, everyone has the freedom to decide their own marriages. There's no need for you to feel burdened or think about our Qing Clan's development. We don't need to form relationships through marriages. With regards to Guo Clan's request, you just need to consider whether you're willing or not. If you're not, I'll make it up to them through other means." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qingqing.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I..."</p>
 <p>"If you don't like him, then we'll just reject it. Your younger brother will help you look for someone better..." Qing Shui smiled and said slowly.</p>
 <p>"I'm willing!" Qingqing said anxiously, feeling embarrassed.</p>
 <p>"You're really willing?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"You rascal. How dare you tease your elder sister." Qingqing smiled back with a flushed face.</p>
 <p>"Mother, as long as Qingqing is willing, everything is fine." Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then this matter is decided." Qing Yi smiled as well.</p>
 <p>"Qingqing, go ask if Guo Polu has any plans on coming to the Continent's Capital for further development. It doesn't matter what his choice is. If he prefers to stay in Yan City, I'll let Guo Clan become the strongest Clan in Yan Jiang Country. It's good if he wants to come here as well, since we'll be closer and it'll be convenient." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>He was very satisfied with that young man. Although he was slightly older than Qing Shui, those who were stronger were revered. Even some old men would have to address Qing Shui as a senior.</p>
 <p>In fact, Qing Shui had never forgotten about Qingqing's marriage. The Qing Clan owed her and so did the Yan Clan. Therefore, Qing Shui had always wanted to make it up to this elder sister in multiple folds. For the past few years, she had also been very happy.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I'll go ask him," Qingqing said softly.</p>
