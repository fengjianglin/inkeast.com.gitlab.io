 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he read the letter, Qing Ming wore a nonchalant smile and said, "We'll fight then. We can't possibly be afraid of them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ming then handed the challenge letter to Qing Yin. Qing Yin didn't even look at it before she passed it to Changfeng. It wasn't that she wasn't concerned but there were things that wouldn't be changed once decided. Even though she wasn't a competitive person, she would still be taking part in this challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Changfeng was older than Qing Zun but he had an honest character. Although he was stronger than Qing Zi, he wasn't someone who could take on heavy responsibilities. He was actually a very clever person. Although he was the eldest son, he wouldn't fight for things in the Qing Clan. When one could get more things without trying to fight for it, then he'd be a fool if he still wants to fight with others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yin and Qing Zun were twins and were now both in their twenties, already considered as adults. Qing Yin looked a lot like Canghai Mingyue and also a little like Qing Shui. The aloofness she exuded was different from Yiye Jiange's ethereal feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yin was closer to her family, but to others, she gave off the feeling that one couldn't come into contact with her. There had been some people who wanted to ask the Qing Clan for her hand in marriage, such as the Nalan Clan. However, Qing Yin's marriage was left for herself to decide. Since Qing Yin didn't wish to accept, the Qing Clan declined the requests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing about rejecting the request, but as the Nalan Clan was a big clan, there would be more or less some news that spread around. This matter had brought the Nalan Clan some shame. Great clans didn't like to be shamed and this matter would lead others to think that the Nalan Clan were unworthy of the people of the Qing Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also due to this reason that some juniors from the Nalan Clan would say bad things about the Qing Clan, they even talked bad about Qing Yin. Spreading rumors like these was to tell others that the Qing Clan was unworthy of the Nalan Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ming was someone who was very protective over his siblings and therefore brought the matter up as if he wanted to shame the Nalan Clan. He even beat up a junior from the Nalan Clan. This made the Nalan Clan feel even more humiliated but they still didn't seem to be taking any big actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this was something between the juniors. If the seniors from the Nalan Clan were to step out, it would appear as if the juniors were too useless. Moreover, they felt that the juniors from their clan were definitely stronger than those from the Qing Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very concerned about the matters regarding the junior members. However, they had already grown up and there were some things which they needed to face themselves. When he was their age, he was already the pillar of the clan. However, his starting point was very low back then. The starting point for his children was a lot higher compared to his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui was very concerned about this matter, he decided to let them decide on how to handle this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Zun and the others chose to accept the challenge. Qing Shui then looked at Luan Luan. This daughter appeared to be very calm, she was young but undeniably very strong. This made her different from the Qing Clan's fourth generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This daughter of his was a lot older than Qing Zun and the others. The young ones held great admiration for this elder sister. Any of the tamed beasts she called out would be much stronger than themselves, additionally, her own ability was also very terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan's main job was to cultivate but she would also help out the other members of the clan to manage the trading business. In this area, she was very well-known but there weren't many who knew of her true abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The challenge was fixed to be in the morning on the day after. The challenge was set to be at four hours and the last one standing in the end would win. This rule seemed to be disadvantageous for the Qing Clan. After all, they had lesser people from the younger generation when comparing with the Nalan Clan. However, they still agreed to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this matter was decided, they went on to talk about other things. The thing that Qing Yi was most concerned about was how long Qing Shui would be staying on this return. For so many years, they had been apart more than they had been together. Although Qing Yi felt that it was very hard on Qing Shui, he still had so many ladies who liked him. She didn't even understand how her son had such great fortune to be liked by so many outstanding ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After knowing that Qing Shui would be staying for a month, Qing Yi didn't know if she should be happy or sad. However, knowing that he was back still made her more happy than sad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui promised them that he would come back often in the future. However, the others didn't take him seriously. After all, this wasn't the first time he said this but he still ended up returning after a very long period of time, and he wasn't able to stay for long each time either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire family had a feast together and chatted for a very long time before they all went back. After all, Qing Shui had his own family and they had their own things to talk about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Yan Lang, Qing Long, as well as Wenren Wu-shuang and Di Qing’s children were still young. Although Qing Long was young, he could already run around by himself. The little kid looked very dignified and strong but he didn’t inherit &nbsp;Qing Shui’s looks. He didn't look like Zhu Qing either. The only similarity he had with his parents was his pair of eyes that looked a little like Qing Shui's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The kid wasn't very good-looking, but he definitely didn't look bad. His appearance was very pleasant to the eyes. His body was a little muscular, making him appear like a young calf. Moreover, he had a bald head, liked to smile, and was very mischievous. He had also never really cried before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's other children had better appearances compared to Qing Long. However, all children looked good in the eyes of their parents. To Qing Shui and Zhu Qing, Qing Long was already very good-looking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Zhu Qing. Holding Qing Long's hand, she appeared very mature and charming. She had the disposition of a docile but dignified lady, her exquisite features made her appear very charming. Qing Shui smiled upon recalling what he had been through with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhu Qing saw Qing Shui smiling as he looked at her with warmth in his eyes, she felt very warm inside. At this moment, she realized that she was very satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and his women returned to the hall in his house. As Yehuang Guwu had to take care of Yan Lang, she headed back first. Zhu Qing, together with Qing Long, as well as Wenren Wu-shuang and Di Qing had all gone back first as their children were still young. There were many things for which children had to be taken care of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the great beauties around him and realized that there was really quite a number of them. He rubbed his nose awkwardly. Canghai Mingyue saw Qing Shui doing that and laughed, "Why, are you thinking that there's really quite a number?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Canghai Mingyue had always been playing the role that was similar to the first wife. She was poised and beautiful and was the first lady that Qing Shui had married. She was also the first to bear one of Qing Shui's children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Qingzhuang's was Qing Shui's first woman, but she was cold by nature. Although she was also very happy when she was with Qing Shui, she gave off the feeling that she was a person who would do things as she wished and treated this world with a little nonchalance most of the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was later that Qing Shui found out that this was her character. She took this very naturally and there was nothing odd about it. Therefore, Qing Shui felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Quite a number of what?" Qing Shui tried to feign ignorance. This was a question he mustn't answer. There was no right answer to this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You rascal. We aren't outsiders anymore. Come on, have you been a Casanova during this period of time?" Canghai Mingyue smiled and looked at Qing Shui with her eyes that were as beautiful as the stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head decisively. "No, I frown at the sight of women now. With each additional relationship I get involved in, I'll feel even more guilt toward you guys."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the ladies heard what Qing Shui said, they giggled. Huoyun Liu-Li smiled a little craftily. She was already a mother, but her character was still the same, "Well, capable people should do more work. If you only have a woman, that person would have a hard time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them were Qing Shui's wives and therefore they all appeared a little embarrassed about this topic. All of them knew that this was the truth, but Huoyun Liu-Li was the only one who could say it so openly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sigh, there are some things in life that are unavoidable. I don't regret this. Even if I'm given another chance, I'll still do the same. I won't split up my love amongst all of you, but I'll love each and every one of you with all my love. Even if the time is a little short, I'll give you guys all that I have." Qing Shui sighed and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We don't blame you. If we were to blame you, we wouldn't have jumped into this." Hai Dongqing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at his women and really felt the urge of having everyone sleep together on the same bed. With more women now, he didn't know what he should do. However, someone did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew if Shi Qingzhuang was really tired or if it was something else. She smiled and said to everyone, "I'll be heading back to rest. See you guys tomorrow!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm tired too!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched with mouth agape as they left one by one. Mingyue Gelou was the only one left behind as she wanted to talk to Qing Shui about Qing Ming. They made it seemed as if they were all tired but she wasn't. In fact, she knew that what the others had said were all excuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and took her hand, "It's too late for you to leave now even if you want to."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mingyue Gelou's face flushed up. She was a poised and traditional lady. Although she had been with Qing Shui for very long, she still got shy very easily. Now that it had been a while since they have gotten together, she suddenly felt a little anxious. She felt just as when they got together for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had wanted to talk about Qing Ming, but was carried up by Qing Shui as he kissed her. Mingyue Gelou's arms wrapped around Qing Shui's neck very quickly, probing her flexible tongue into Qing Shui's mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pulled her in very closely, his body rubbing against her skin. That bounciness and her excitement could be felt even through their clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Mingyue Gelou had been entirely stripped of her clothes. Under Qing Shui's Duo Cultivation, Mingyue Gelou seemed even younger than before, yet even more mature. Her fair skin was like jade, and her well-embodied breasts displayed their beauty proudly. The pink and tender tips on her breasts made it hard for one to imagine that this was a mother of two kids.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her well-proportioned and slender body didn’t have a bit of excess flab on it. Her toned body exuded a mesmerizing glow and under Qing Shui's gaze, her perfect body had a faint pink color. Her beautiful cheeks were also a little flushed, beautiful eyes were slightly misted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn't hold back anymore and embraced her, then entered a warm and wet area very quickly...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this night, Qing Shui was very busy. The night was very long, but Qing Shui didn't stop for even a moment. He only arrived at Shi Qingzhuang's room when the day lit up. She had already woken up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People said that a lady's beauty shouldn't be gauged by how she usually looked, nor how she appeared with her makeup on. Instead, it should be based on how she looked when she just woke up. If she was beautiful at that moment, then that was a real beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wearing her sleeping gown, a faint smile appeared on Shi Qingzhuang's quiet face. Although her hair was a little messy, it only added to the feminine charm she exuded. She could tell that Qing Shui hadn't rested the entire night and pointed next to her. "Are you tired? Why don't you sleep for a while?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Qingzhuang's smile made Qing Shui felt very calm. On this night, Master Qing had been very tired, thankfully, his body was strong enough. He didn't wish for any of them to feel unsatisfied. Therefore, he went all out and tried his best to arrive at Shi Qingzhuang's when she got up in the morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't considered late and those who went for morning practice had already woken up. Qing Shui smiled and got under Shi Qingzhuang's blanket, breathing that fragrant and elegant scent as he hugged her.</span></p>
