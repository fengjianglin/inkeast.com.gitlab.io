With haste, Qing Shui put the Golden Battle Halberd in front of him to block the Immortal Vanquishing Arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>

He was unable to withstand the arrow’s force even with the Golden Battle Halberd blocking. However, the Immortal Vanquishing Arrow was still shooting towards Qing Shui with the same force as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!~~</span></p>

While Qing Shui was injured before, his body could still take it, but now, the attack was lethal enough to activate the Golden Armor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a meteorite, Qing Shui’s body was blown backwards once again while the Immortal Vanquishing Arrow continued shooting toward him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As this happened, everyone started getting nervous since anyone could tell that it was a fatal shot. Fast like thunder, it didn’t allow its target even a chance to catch a breath. Yes, this was the strength of a Divine Weapon. Even Qing Shui, at his current state, was incapable of blocking against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui looked at the Immortal Vanquishing Arrow that’s closing in, his expression could be seen changing from time to time with a sense of helplessness. At the same time, he could also see the cold and ruthless smile on Yan Ziyun’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of him and blocked his sight. Qing Shui was surprised as he saw the beautiful figure. Soon after, the Immortal Vanquishing Arrow pierced through the body of the figure in front of him and disappeared right before it was about to pierce through his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

Meanwhile, Qing Shui watched as the beautiful figure in front of him shivered and stumbled down toward him. At this moment, he felt tremendous pain as if his heart had been cut by a knife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Sunset Palace Mistress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who stood in front of him was none other than the Sunset Palace Mistress. At that moment, she stood in front of him without the slightest hesitation. Even though the Immortal Vanquishing Arrow still struck him in the end, its power had been severely reduced after repeated attempts at blocking it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, Qing Shui was still heavily injured. Despite that, he was still able to move. He hugged the Sunset Palace Mistress while looking at her beautiful, yet pale face. As blood constantly flowed out of her chest, he quickly reached out his hands and placed them on top of her chest, but despite all his attempts, blood still pouring out continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Qing Shui, it’s useless!” The Sunset Palace Mistress shook her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While looking at the Sunset Palace Mistress, for a moment, Muyun Qingge felt as if her entire world had been covered in darkness as tears were constantly flowing down her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You will be fine. I won’t let anything happen to you!” Qing Shui’s eyes were red. He thought hard, then immediately reached out as a leaf of the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Qing Shui’s demonic beasts were still resisting against the enemies’ attacks along with Shui Yunfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no doubt about the power of Golden Buddha Aura Lotus’s leaf. However, as a hole was pierced through the Sunset Palace Mistress’s body, the leaf could only keep her body’s condition from weakening any further. Living up to its name, the Immortal Vanquishing Arrow was capable of slaying immortals with its terrifying power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, stop wasting all of these sacred medicines.” The Sunset Palace Mistress said weakly after eating the leaf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

I am going to make sure I kill every last one of them first.” Qing Shui left the Sunset Palace Mistress with Muyun Qingge. He then approached Yan Ziyun with the Golden Battle Halberd in hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui possessed enormous killing intent like never before. He was furious to the limit that he must kill to let out all of his anger. Otherwise, he felt that he would go crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Palace Laws!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</span></p>

A gap then formed in the opponents’ previously set up formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a pair of scissors, Qing Shui charged forward with the Golden Battle Halberd in hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant abruptly stomped on the ground. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s stomp had already instilled fear in the Ocean Demons as earlier, it was precisely this battle technique that instantly killed one of the most powerful men among them. This was precisely the outcome Qing Shui wanted. Despite his anger, he still wouldn’t try to go toe-to-toe against multiple opponents at once, even more so when the opponents’ formation was still in effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Palace Steps! Great Reversal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui instantly switched position with one of the Ocean Demons and immediately struck out his Golden Battle Halberd. His strike was as fast as lightning. It was one of the techniques from the Basic Sword Technique, but compared to before, its strength was at a whole different level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ocean Demon couldn’t figure out how Qing Shui appeared right in front of him and why his comrades be so far away all of a sudden, and it quickly fled. This was a serious mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

But now, there was no way he would get through this alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

After that, Qing Shui once again made his move.&nbsp;</span></p>

Despite his anger, he could see everything around him very clearly. Even the slightest movement in the surroundings couldn’t escape his eyes. It felt as though everything was in slow motion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes… This was the effect brought forth by the Yin-Yang Image…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his eyes closed, Qing Shui was able to precisely grasp the movements of his opponents. Just like having a third eye which could detect activity in slow motion, he was able to see the people around him clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like now, even though a sword shadow was approaching him from the side silently, Qing Shui still remained calm and didn’t move. As the Sword Qi had a very domineering aura, Qing Shui had long felt the chilliness emitted from it and dodged with an unbelievably agile movement. He then abruptly unleashed the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle between elites was quite similar to when two ordinary people fought against each other, but the strength and speed were far more exaggerated. When strength reached a certain stage, it would begin to generate Qi waves: Sword Qi, Origin Qi, Origin Energy Wave or even causing the Origin Qi itself to start to take a form of its own. When a person cultivated his Five Elements Technique up to a certain stage, the elements would begin shaping their own forms. When a fire-attributed power became powerful to a certain extent, it would condense into fire and as it power increased, the fire would also become more intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui was able to advance and retreat as he pleased in between his opponents, which still caused him to be quite agitated. Could this be an unusual change in the Yin-yang Image?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But whenever he thought of the Sunset Palace Mistress, he was unable to feel happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ocean Demon from before immediately was swept off by Qing Shui. Even though he had used his weapons to block against Qing Shui’s attacks, he still suffered quite a heavy injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Palace Step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only now that Qing Shui realized what it felt exactly like to be a duck in water. Standing in front of him, all of his opponents were totally helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a kind of Great Perfection Stage and it also represented an unusual change in his Yin-Yang Image. This had triggered a change in his Nine Palace Step, while the Nine Continents Mountain was still the same and only changed when its ability was used together with the Yin-Yang Image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s just like driving a car, but driving on a wide and flat road instead of a bumpy one. This would result in a significant change in the car’s efficiency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The car, in this case, was the Nine Palace Step and the change in the Yin-Yang Image on the other hand, was the bumpy road turning into a highway. This was how it had its current efficiency and speed. Without the car, whether there was a bumpy road or a highway, there would be no difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For now, Qing Shui was able to advance and retreat as he pleased and the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand was like a golden dragon. Time after time, it was able to disrupt the opponent's teamwork. Soon after, yet another Ocean Demon died by Qing Shui’s halberd.</span></p>
