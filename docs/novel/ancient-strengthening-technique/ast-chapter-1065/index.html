 <p><strong>AST 1065 - Live Because of You, Die Because of You, Violet Dragon Mountain</strong></p>
 <p>This wasn't the first time that Yiye Jiange told Qing Shui this. This showed how concerned she was and Qing Shui understood that as well. He even thought of how he could never allow anything to happen to himself. Yiye Jiange said that if something were to happen to him, she wouldn't be able to forgive herself even if she die. Actually, he was the one with the problem. He was the one who wouldn't be able to forgive himself if he died.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he wouldn't allow himself to fail, there must not be any mishaps. Right now, the Qing Clan had already become stronger and gained reputation but without him, misfortune would still befall on them.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui was very confident on his own abilities but it doesn’t that he was invincible in the five continents. It was just like how it was with that beast of the earth, the 地蛟龙 Earth Jiao. That powerful existence wasn't something that he could handle at the moment, and thus, he hoped that he would be able to gain more progress in this Ancient Ruins. The Lion King's Ridge was his last stop in the five continents. If anything were to happen, all of his hard work from before would all go to waste.</p>
 <p>"Jiange, trust me. If something were to happen to me, even I won't be able to forgive myself even if I were to die. Alright, just bear with it for a little longer. As for these people, I'll let them stay forever in the Ancient Ruins." Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange warmly, his eyes full of love and pity.</p>
 <p>"You must remember, only do what are within your abilities. I've already waited for so many years and wouldn't mind waiting for a little longer. You are not by yourself. Many people live because of you and would die because of you. Qing Shui, do you understand?" Yiye Jiange calmed down and said softly.</p>
 <p>"Live because of you, die because of you!"</p>
 <p>This line cut into Qing Shui's heart like a sharp blade. It wasn't painful but more of a feeling as if something was tearing inside. It was an indescribable feeling. One of blissfulness and agitation. It was a tearing feeling that was extremely strong, yet he found it impossible to describe.</p>
 <p>"You foolish woman. In the future, you're not allowed to say something like this. Even if something were to happen, you must live on. There're still many things you have to do. For example, by then, we should already have kids of our own. You'll need to bring up our children..."</p>
 <p>"Why are you still spouting such rubbish at this time? Alright, I know you have your own thinking. Our Qing Shui is also very strong but you still must think through carefully before you take any action." Yiye Jiange smiled. The hand that was touching his face now started to pinch it.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was already kept, while the others had found an empty spot and stood there. Qing Shui scanned the surroundings, looking for familiar people.</p>
 <p>"Mmm! Demon Gate!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the place the Demon Gate was at a distance away. He felt very warm inside. The person who led the team was the Demon Gate's old man, Mo Hongluo's father. Mo Zitong was around as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked again. He discovered that there were really other people he knew. Sky City's label was around but he didn't see Qin Zongheng and Weng Xue. He didn't know if they had come.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't see Yu He either. He didn't know if it was because she hadn't come or was just hidden amongst the crowd. After he finished scanning around, he drew back his gaze.</p>
 <p>As they had to stay here for up to 20 days, they decided to set up their tents outside before meeting other people like the Demon Gate. After all, they were relatives and this was the Northern Sacred Lu Continent.</p>
 <p>Although the ladies covered up their faces with face veils, the disposition and expressions they exuded, as well as their wonderful figures still attracted many pairs of eyes. These people were mostly young men who were known as geniuses as well as men who didn't seem very old.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's spiritual sense was very sharp and even if some people hid it well, they weren't able to sneak past him. It didn't matter if they were just admiring, since there were four to five ladies with graceful dispositions paired with great figures that appeared at the same time, it would definitely be hard not to attract any attention.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed his surroundings without saying anything. All the people here had set up their own tents and of course, many of them came in big groups. They would group up as people from the same continents or from the same country. This was a sense of belonging which they had.</p>
 <p>After setting up their tents, the few of them headed to the Demon Gate. Halfway there, the people from the Demon Gate had also noticed the Qing Clan. The Demon Gate's Old Ancestor didn't find it strange when he saw Qing Shui and the old man just came over happily. A few other old men and Mo Zitong joined him as well.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I knew that you would come." The old man said.</p>
 <p>His voice wasn't very loud but many people in the surroundings could hear him very clearly. It was as if these words had created an explosion since the name ‘Qing Shui’ had already spread very wide out amongst those in power.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui? He is Qing Shui?"</p>
 <p>"The young man who had eradicated the Beiming Clan and the Wan Clan?"</p>
 <p>"Even the Central Continent's Buddha Sect wasn't a match for him?"</p>
 <p>"This is what a genius is. This is what a demon is..."</p>
 <p>In but a short moment, commotion broke out. The people here all had great power and when a clan reached a certain level of power, they would have their scouts in various continents to collect information and news about those major influences. This would prevent them from being in the passive stand and thus the things that Qing Shui had done in a continent would be known once it was spread out.</p>
 <p>Even if Qing Shui wasn't in the center of attention back then, the powers which he had eradicated were. Therefore, he quickly became a person who everyone paid great attention to.</p>
 <p>"Sir, you guys have come as well. That's great." Qing Shui went up to shake the old man's hand and said happily.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui!" Mo Zitong also said happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and greeted Mo Zitong. This future successor of the Demon Gate had already put down a lot of his pride, at least before him. Or it could be said that he was already changing. What had changed him was Qing Shui and the people around him.</p>
 <p>Pride was a necessity but not when in an excessive amount. In the World of the Nine Continents, if one wanted to be respected, one must have power. Those without power could only remain as an insignificant ant without any pride at all. It was because no one would want to talk about pride with a weakling.</p>
 <p>The few of them found an empty space, laid down a thick rug made of beast’s hide and chatted while they sat together..</p>
 <p>"Sir, this time around, are majority of the people of that level in the five continents here?" Qing Shui looked around as he took out some wine and passed it to everyone.</p>
 <p>"These people are just the tip of the iceberg in the five continents. There are many who don't reveal themselves and stayed hidden in the dark. Although there are restrictions in the World of the Nine Continents, when there are more people, anything could be possible. There are too many people in this world. Do you understand?" The old man received Qing Shui's wine and took a sip.</p>
 <p>"Great wine, this is really great wine. This is the best wine I've ever drank." The old man couldn't help but praise.</p>
 <p>"I understand. It's good that you like it. I still have some of these." Qing Shui lifted up his cup slightly and took a sip as well. He understood what the old man had said. With an immeasurable population, many experts could appear as long as one was strong enough to be able to come into contact with them.</p>
 <p>"Sir, do you know a lot about this Ancient Ruins? Are there anything to take note of inside?"</p>
 <p>"I've only entered the Ancient Ruins once despite living such a long life. I didn't go too deep inside either. The Ancient Ruins is like a paradise but it's extremely dangerous. The ancient beasts and ferocious beasts come in huge numbers and the natural disasters are very powerful as well. Even strong cultivators might feel helpless and weak at times. The dangers inside would catch people unaware. It would be relatively safe if one were to not go too deeply inside. Otherwise, you would have to face the threat of large numbers of powerful demonic beasts, as well as the terrifying natural disasters."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the few ladies joined him while he asked the Demon Gate's Old Ancestor. He was worried and wanted them to have a better understanding so that they could be more prepared.</p>
 <p>"Who's Qing Shui?"</p>
 <p>Just then, an abrupt voice rang out. It was clear and penetrating. The voice sounded neither young nor old, as it sounded gender neutral as well. It was not a bad voice and it left a very deep impression.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't stand up but just looked into the distance. There were over ten people which were heading in his direction and the person leading them was the one who spoke. He seemed to be middle-aged at most and the violet long robe he was wearing was extremely fitting on him.</p>
 <p>He looked very handsome and the violet dragon jade pendant at his waist stood out a lot. On one look, one could tell that it was no ordinary jade pendant. His slightly leisurely gaze gave him an indescribable charm and attraction. By now, he had already walked up to be just a short distance away from Qing Shui, clearly knowing who he was.</p>
 <p>There were both old and young people behind him, all of them had a very leisure expression, as if they were extremely outstanding and were looking down on the rest of the world.</p>
 <p>"They are people from the Violet Dragon Mountain!" Someone gasped.</p>
 <p>"Violet Dragon Mountain? What's that?" Someone asked.</p>
 <p>"Brother, be careful. If they were to hear you, your background won't be enough for them to even pick their teeth." The old man from earlier said softly.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Gang, quickly tell us what kind of existence this Violet Dragon Mountain is," The man who seemed to be a lot younger quickly said.</p>
 <p>"The Violet Dragon Mountain is known as a reclusive aristocrat clan. They tend not to ask about the things in the outside world and only enjoy freedom, adventure, and treasure hunting. You'll only have the opportunity to see them in such an occasion. They are even stronger than some of the Guardian Clans." The old man said slowly and many people had gathered around him. It was clear that many of them didn't really know the Violet Dragon Mountain.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Gang, do you know why these people from the Violet Dragon Mountain are looking for Qing Shui?" Someone asked.</p>
 <p>"This, I wouldn't know. Qing Shui has been making a name for himself of late, having eradicated two Guardian Clans from the Northern Sacred Lu Continent. The Violet Dragon Mountain is also from the Northern Sacred Lu Continent. I guessed that someone from the Northern Sacred Lu Continent would deal with Qing Shui but I didn't expected it to be the Violet Dragon Mountain. Of course, it's still hard to say whether they'll do anything to Qing Shui." The old man shook his head and said, indicating that he knew nothing more.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"You're looking for me?" Qing Shui took a sip of wine before he slowly stood up and said to the extremely dignified man. His tone was very nonchalant.</p>
 <p>This was how Qing Shui always did things. He couldn't stand this kind of arrogance and superiority, and thus, when he encountered such people, the best solution is to be even more arrogant. This was something that these people couldn't stand the most.</p>
 <p>"You were the one who had wiped out the Beiming Clan and the Wan Clan?" The man frowned, his expression quite serious.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw how the man was acting. If it wasn't because he had overheard the discussions about the Violet Dragon Mountain, he wouldn't know who they were. Right now, he still wasn't clear why this man had came to look for him. Was he related to the Beiming Clan and the Wan Clan? Or did he just want to stand up for them.</p>
