 <p><strong>AST 860 - Sacred Land, Yu He Returns To Hundred Miles City</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything but when Sun Yan was holding that Heart of the Black Gem, he could sense that Sun Yan had purified and absorbed the spiritual energy. He had done so without batting an eye, causing that Heart of the Black Gem to become a rock without any value.</p>
 <p>There were too many people in the world of the nine continents and many strange people as well. There were even people with Golden Bloodline and Violet Bloodline (also known as Violet Golden Bloodline). Moreover, weren't the things which happened to Qing Shui mysterious enough? Therefore, he could now easily accept any strange occurrence.</p>
 <p>It might be a unique physique of Sun Yan’s that allowed him to reach a cultivation level which Qing Shui couldn't sense despite being so young. However, Qing Shui could sense that Sun Yan's level was on par with his but wasn't as strong as Dong Yan.</p>
 <p>However, if it was in a one-on-one battle, it would be hard to tell who the victor would be. After all, they each had their killing techniques. However, Qing Shui had the confidence to beat them since he had the Thunderous Beast and with the current prowess his primordial flames was at.</p>
 <p>In terms of spirit energy, Qing Shui didn't dare to say that he was comparable to a Martial Emperor but there were not many from amongst the Martial Emperors that would be able to be to suppress him. As long as he was not suppressed mentally, then he would have the ability to put up a fight. Such a suppression was a complete suppression. If they couldn't succeed in suppressing him, they would be the ones in danger.</p>
 <p>"Let's head to the city!" After giving it some thought, Dong Yan said to Qing Shui and Sun Yan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded. So did Sky Penetrating Mountains. Qing Shui's intention was to head to the city and then to find a way to get to the Sky Penetrating Mountains. Dong Yan was from Dong Clan but he was not that sure about Sun Yan.</p>
 <p>"Come, get on. We can chat on the way." Dong Yan called out his beast ride. It was a huge Golden Eyed Tiger Hawk Beast, a golden-eyed flying demonic beast with a tiger's head and a hawk's body.</p>
 <p>The three of them leaped up and landed on the back of the Golden Eyed Tiger Hawk Beast, quickly flying toward the city.</p>
 <p>"Second Brother, do you have a feud with Linghu Clan?" Dong Yan gave it some thought and asked.</p>
 <p>"Eldest Brother can tell?" Sun Yan asked doubtfully.</p>
 <p>What Sun Yan was asking was actually if Dong Yan could tell that he had absorbed the energy from the Heart of the Black Gem.</p>
 <p>"I can sense it slightly but I can't be sure. If you were to deny it, I would believe that as well," Dong Yan smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not expected Dong Yan to raise the question he had wanted to ask. He smiled and looked at Sun Yan. "Seems like 3rd Brother could tell as well. Those who can tell are all extremely talented people. It seems that it's the guiding from the Heavens that we can become brothers here today." Sun Yan smiled, as if he was very happy.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Today is really a happy day, a very happy day," Dong Yan smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Is Eldest Brother on very good terms with Dongfang Aristocrat Clan?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>"Interests, it's all about the interests. Dongfang Clan's businesses need our Dong Clan to help cover them. We don't have that much of a relationship, it's just all about mutual interests," Dong Yan smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"The people from Linghu Clan bully the weak and fear the strong. I've seen Linghu Clan's Young Master beating up the elderly and snatching women. The people from Dongfang Aristocrat Clan are no better, it's just that they've done a good job of keeping up their facade. In reality, they are no better than Linghu Clan. Therefore, I wanted to let the grudge between the two clans become even stronger. It'd be even better if they could end up fighting," Sun Yan smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Haha, I'm clear about what Dongfang Clan has been doing. It's just as what second Brother has said, thus I don't have a good impression of them. Although it appears as if they treat me very well, they actually hate me a lot but just can't do anything about it." Dong Yan looked at them and smiled.</p>
 <p>"That's right, 3rd Brother, why have you come all the way to the Eastern Victory Divine Continent alone from Greencloud Continent? You can tell us, no need to stand on ceremony with us." Dong Yan smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"I'm here to look for Sky Penetrating Grass which is 5,000 Years or older," Qing Shui smiled and answered.</p>
 <p>"Sky Penetrating Grass? That is is a rare treasure. Although Dong Clan has quite some rare treasures, the Sky Penetrating Grass isn't one of them," Dong Yan was stunned as he spoke to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"I know. This is really a rare find. I've heard that the chances of it appearing in the Sky Penetrating Mountains seems to be slightly higher," Qing Shui said after some though. He knew that this was something he could discuss with them.</p>
 <p>"Mmmm, the Sky Penetrating Mountains is one of the most dangerous places in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. The place is filled with heavenly and earthly treasures as well as rare mutated beasts. However, it's just too dangerous. 80% of the Sky Penetrating Grass out here is from the Sky Penetrating Mountains," Dong Yan looked at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>"Then that's good. I was worried that even the Sky Penetrating Mountains might not have it. Then I'd really be left with no way out." When Qing Shui heard Dong Yan's words, he was slightly relieved. It was fine even if it was dangerous, at least, there was still a chance.</p>
 <p>"If third Brother must really go in, get someone to go with you. At least you'll be able to take care of each other and the success rate would be higher," Dong Yan gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, seems like it's really dangerous inside but I'll definitely go in." Qing Shui had not expected that Dong Yan would say something similar to the old man from Golden Buddha Temple. It seemed like he would really need to find someone to accompany him for this trip.</p>
 <p>"Alright, when we've reached the city, Eldest Brother will recommend you to a clan. This clan is a bit special and enters the Sky Penetrating Mountains once in awhile. If you were to enter with them, I'll be at ease too," Dong Yan gave it some thought before looking at Qing Shui seriously and saying.</p>
 <p>"Then I'll have to thank Eldest Brother." Qing Shui had not expected that Dong Yan would be able to find such a clan for him. This was good as well, at least his company for the trip was settled and would probably be able to enter the Sky Penetrating Mountains soon. As long as he managed to get his hands on the Sky Penetrating Grass, he would be able to refine two medicinal pills which would increase his abilities by a lot, to the extent that he might even soar into the skies...</p>
 <p>"We're brothers, why the need to stand on ceremony?" Dong Yan smiled and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded, feeling very warm inside.</p>
 <p>It really felt more relaxing to have someone he was familiar with when in a foreign land.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>In a barren land, a lady in crescent white colored silk clothes was looking at the sky, a light frown appearing on her beautiful face.</p>
 <p>"Chen`er, you're thinking about him again," an old lady with white hair but the complexion of a youth walked up to her and spoke softly.</p>
 <p>"Master, I'm now already a Peak Martial Saint. When will I be able to leave?" Di Chen looked at the old lady and asked.</p>
 <p>"Chen`er, with your current abilities, you'll not be able to help him if you were to go back. Don't you wish to help him? You should know how he has been living all his life." The old lady looked at Di Chen and sighed.</p>
 <p>"Master, what cultivation level must I be at to be able to help him?" Di Chen asked the old lady.</p>
 <p>"I haven't told you before but I'm someone from "Lotus Realm"." The old lady looked at Di Chen and smiled, saying.</p>
 <p>“Lotus Realm?”</p>
 <p>"That's right. Not many people in the world of the nine continents know of this existence. It is one of the three sacred lands and as my disciple, you're naturally also someone from Lotus Realm. Now, there's a way out for you," the old lady looked at Di Chen and said slowly.</p>
 <p>Di Chen was now feeling slightly numbed. Looking at the old lady, she asked, "What is it?”</p>
 <p>"Go back with me to "Lotus Realm" to take the Test of the Sacred Platform. With your bone structure and having cultivated the secret manual of the Lotus Realm, you should be able to get through it. When that happens, your abilities will improve by a lot and you will be able to receive the legacy of the sacred land. It'll be very easy for you to help him then." The old lady looked at Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Di Chen had been here for a very long time and had been practicing the martial techniques the old lady had imparted to her. There was no shortage of medicinal pills and she thought that she would be able to leave after having gained some success in the martial technique but to think that a Lotus Realm sacred land had popped up.</p>
 <p>She knew that this old lady whom she called Master would not harm her but would just do her good. Her feelings for this old lady surpassed what she had for her own father. it was because this old lady had risked her life in order to protect Di Chen.</p>
 <p>"Does Master wishes for me to do this?" Di Chen looked at the old lady and asked softly.</p>
 <p>The old lady hesitated for a short moment before nodding.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then I'll listen to you," Di Chen smiled and said to the old lady.</p>
 <p>However, her heart sank. She didn't even know the reason why it did.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Several huge flying beasts soared over Hundred Miles City. The one in the lead was even a green colored Mystic Bird while the other four were white-colored Tiger Swallows. A lady was standing on the huge Mystic Bird while there were four ladies who were standing on each of the respective Tiger Swallow. They were all young beautiful ladies.</p>
 <p>The one lady on the Mystic Bird had a beautiful figure with great curves. There was no expression on her dignified and beautiful face but a hint of gentleness would appear when she looked toward the ground.</p>
 <p>They only landed after arriving near Yu clan. By this time, many people had already gathered near Yu Clan, wanting to see who they had offended. However, when they saw the lady in the lead, they were all stunned.</p>
 <p>Yu He!</p>
 <p>To think that this beautiful lady was actually Yu He who had left a few years ago. Compared to before, she had an aura that made it hard for others to get near...</p>
 <p>"Grandfather!"</p>
 <p>When Yu He saw Yu Donghao, she called out and ran over.</p>
 <p>"Lass, you're back!" A gratified smiled appeared on Yu Donghao's face. His granddaughter had grown up.</p>
 <p>The people from Yu Clan were both surprised and happy. Just from seeing the few powerful flying demonic beasts and the auras and disposition given out by the ten plus ladies, they could tell that the Yu He today was different from before.</p>
 <p>However, some of them felt a bit uneasy. Back then, there were quite a number of people who had not treated Yu He well. If not for the fact that Yu Donghao adored his granddaughter, she would probably have been forced to be left with nothing. But now, Yu Clan would probably be nothing to her.</p>
 <p>Things were now different from before. What was the use of thinking of the past? One's level determined one's sights.</p>
 <p>It was impossible for Yu He to forget about everything but the things in the past, especially those which were unhappy memories, were now not worth mentioning. She would not change nor did she hope to. Those who had caused trouble for her in the past were her kin by blood and on her grandfather's account, she would not deal with them. However, neither would she form good relations with them. It was not worth it.</p>
 <p>Those who had treated her well in the past when she was down, she would return the favor to them several times over.</p>
 <p>"Tongning, instruct the kitchen staff to prepare a more sumptuous meal," Yu Donghao laughed happily and said.</p>
 <p>"Yes, Old Master! A middle-aged man smiled and said before quickly leaving."</p>
 <p>"Young Miss, we'll head to an inn nearby," a few young and beautiful ladies said to Yu He.</p>
 <p>Yu He hesitated before nodding. There was no need to worry for their safety. Putting Hundred Miles City aside, there were not many people in Greencloud Continent who would dare to do anything to them.</p>
