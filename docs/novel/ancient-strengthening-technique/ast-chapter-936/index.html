 <p><strong>AST 936 - Using the Nine Continents Steps, An inhospitable environment has many wicked people </strong></p>
 <p>“Indeed, it has been 2000 years since an ancient relic had appeared. Every time an ancient relic appeared, some large sects would end up being eradicated. However, after many years, even hundreds of years, there would be some new big sects or large clans.”</p>
 <p>Yu he raised her head and looked into the distance. She spoke very fast, it was still considered keeping it short.</p>
 <p>Although Yu He did not say much, the most important bits were said. Furthermore, Qing Shui was quite familiar with the ancient relics. Every time an ancient relic appeared, countless experts would be killed, likewise, many new experts would arise.</p>
 <p>This was the trend of a fatal attraction. Despite knowing about the danger, they could not help but go forward. The bigger the risk, the greater the rewards. For this matter, only those qualified could enter, basically anyone that could arrive could enter.</p>
 <p>Of course, there were some exceptions. There were people who were satisfied with what they have. Many people also knew that it was a deathtrap, only one would live out of ten. Most people understood this. However, those who could make a rational decision were few.</p>
 <p>The seal of the ancient relic was very strong. Even at this weakest, it was not that everyone could enter. As to what level of strength was required, no one could say until it happened.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the ancient relic in the Northern Sacred Lu Continent still needed another three years before it opened. He never expected that Yu He would already have obtained news about it. Not counting this piece of news, the things that were known about it were few.</p>
 <p>Although many people knew that the great powers had some movement, even those who knew about the ancient relics and that the time was coming, the number of people who knew the location were few. By the time the exact location was found, only a few would be able to rush to it. Cultivators below Martial Saint would not qualify to enter. Thus, those who entered, were experts. That was why it was easy to cause a change in the powers.</p>
 <p>“Will Elder Sister Yu go?” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui felt that he would definitely go. In three years of time, he did not know if he would have the ability to bring Yiye Jiange to the Lion King's Ridge in Northern Sacred Lu Continent. If he had the ability to do so in these three years, he would do his best to help her resolve this matter.</p>
 <p>He felt that in three years, his strength would be sufficient. When that happened, he would resolve Yiye Jiange’s dream. He would then go to that ancient relic. After all, it was extremely dangerous there, even he could not guarantee his survival. However, he was still confident.</p>
 <p>“I do not know, in three years time… I wish to go but we will see when the time comes. I know you will definitely go. That’s why I am telling you in advance, so you can make your preparations.” Yu He sighed.</p>
 <p>“You also said it, there are still three years. Who knows what will happen. However, I will be sure to prepare for it.” Qing Shui looked forward to that ancient relics.</p>
 <p>Although it was dangerous there, there were a lot of benefits that he could obtain. There was still a group of Demonic Beast in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui felt that three years later, he should be able to protect himself.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>They managed to make great headway in one day. The speed of the Fire Bird had increased significantly. Unfortunately, Qing Shui was unable to use the Nine Continents Steps, causing him to feel depressed…...</p>
 <p>Seeing that the sky was turning dark, Qing Shui returned eagerly. If he wasted the Nine Continents Steps, he would have wasted a lot of time. This was something that Qing Shui could not accept. He rubbing his nose countless of times and wanted to tell Yu He. However, he was not able to do so.</p>
 <p>Right now, they happened to be in the wilderness. There were no villages or shops around. They were prepared to eat something and rest here for a night. Then they would continue on their journey the next day.</p>
 <p>It was simple and fast for Qing Shui to prepare some food.</p>
 <p>“I miss the days in Hundred Miles City. I want to eat the things that you prepared,” Yu He looked at Qing Shui expertly cooking something.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hands trembled, then he quietly continued cooking. The smile on his face did not change. A familiar fragrance wafted out. Yu He had a satisfied smile on her face.</p>
 <p>After drinking some fish soup and eating half a fish, Yu He stopped eating. She watched Qing Shui eat. She felt that the situation now was good, she was not able to explain it, nor did she know why. She had been hesitating. She was afraid of the consequences. If that would be the result, she’d rather remain as his good friend.</p>
 <p>Very soon, the two of them finished eating. Qing Shui looked at the surroundings. The sky just turned dark. He had opened his mouth a few times. Although he was determined to say something, it still felt very difficult.</p>
 <p>However, if he used the Nine Continents Steps, they would be much faster. He had to say it anyway, so he took a deep breath and looked at Yu he.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you have something to say. You have already opened your mouth a few times. When did you become so reserved? Just say it. If I can do it, then I will do it.” Yu He saw his expression and knew that he might have something to speak about, that was difficult to say.</p>
 <p>“I have a method to travel very fast, but I would require your cooperation……”</p>
 <p>“Travel fast? How do we cooperate?” Yu he looked at Qing Shui in astonishment.</p>
 <p>It was not pleasant to rush. Furthermore, Yu He did not wish for her time to be wasted on rushing.</p>
 <p>“Come, since we are going to travel that way, let us get into the sky first.” After Qing Shui said this, he pulled on Yu He’s hand and headed to the sky.</p>
 <p>Yu He’s body trembled slightly, but she did not resist Qing Shui’s pull. She found that she was nervous and also anticipating it. An anticipation of something she was not sure of.</p>
 <p>The two of them stood across from each other high in the sky. Yu he looked at Qing Shui, but he still held onto one of her hands.</p>
 <p>“Elder Sister Yu, please don’t take offense at this, it is for the sake of traveling faster.” Qing Shui took a step forward. One of the hands grabbed onto Yu He’s waist. Just when Yu He frowned...</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hand that was holding onto her hand grabbed her tightly. He had no choice, he was afraid of a mistake. The consequences would be terrible.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Steps only lasted for an instant.</p>
 <p>After the Nine Continents Steps was used, it became Yu He’s turn to hug Qing Shui tightly. She now knew why. She did not blame QIng Shui. She was even secretly happy.</p>
 <p>Standing high in the air, there was a city of Eastern Victory Divine Continent below. As to which city it was, Qing Shui did not know. The lights below were very bright, but as they were at a high altitude, there was only some starlight and moonlight in their surroundings. The lights from below were not ablet to shine that far.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that Yu He was holding onto him very tightly. This was normal. This was the reflex caused by using the Nine Continents Steps. He stretched out his hands, grabbed onto her again and used another Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, there was a city below as well. However, it was the outskirts of the city. The surroundings were completely dark. Yu He closed her eyes, as though she was enjoying the Nine Continents Steps. Qing Shui did not disturb her...</p>
 <p>“How many times can you use this?” Yu He raised her head, but her two jade like arms were still hugging Qing Shui’s neck. He could feel some pressure coming from her chest.</p>
 <p>“I can use it twice everyday.” Qing Shui looked somewhat weakly at Yu He, as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“That’s great, if I have any urgent matters in future, I can come look for you. So you can send me to where I need.” Yu He smiled at Qing Shui</p>
 <p>Qing Shui: “......”</p>
 <p>It was only the early evening. The two of them descended onto the large street. There was a night market. This was a bustling street with many people shouting out their goods and joyous laughter resounded.</p>
 <p>There were many people who noticed the appearance of Qing Shui and Yu He. Many men were sneaking peeks at Yu he. However, most of them just took a look because they knew that a woman like her was not something they could possess.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yu He did not know what city they were in, nor were they interested. They were just here to stay for a night.</p>
 <p>“Shall we go get a room first?” Qing Shui smiled at Yu He who was looking at the sky.</p>
 <p>“No, accompany me to shop first. We will get a room later. If there are no more rooms later, then you will have to accompany me shopping for the whole night.” Yu He seemed to enjoy the surrounding environment. She was looking everywhere.</p>
 <p>Actually it was not that she liked this place, it was because of the person beside her. This caused even the surrounding environment to become pleasant for her.</p>
 <p>Hearing her say this, Qing Shui did not have any other opinion. He accompanied Yu he as she shopped. This street was very wide and long, there were also many snacks, games and clothes here.</p>
 <p>The new year had not passed yet, the atmosphere of the new year was still quite heavy.</p>
 <p>The two of them walked amongst the crowd. However, despite the bustling crowd, there was no one in within two meters of them. Those that wanted to get near would automatically be pushed aside.</p>
 <p>Time slowly went by, at the front of this street, there was a crossroad, a huge crossroad. This was the intersection between two streets. Although the two streets were very wide, beast carriages were prohibited.</p>
 <p>At the left of the crossroad, there was a big plaza. There were many sounds of praises coming from there and fireworks being fired into the sky. The fireworks were just fired off one by one, unlike those of New Year’s Eve, where the entire sky would be filled with fireworks.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, let’s go take a look. It is very lively there,” Yu He said happily to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Most of the people here were ordinary people. There were dragon dances and lion dances, sword dances, martial arts performances...</p>
 <p>These were not strange to Qing Shui, it was very similar to his previous life. Looking at those sword dances and martial arts performances, he would have looked forward to those, thinking that they were very strong, that they had to practice for many years to reach that level of proficiency. However, now when he looked at it, he felt differently.</p>
 <p>Yu He was different. Although she was from a small city like Hundred Miles City, she was from a large clan in that small city. Thus she was not able to mingle with the common folk. It was different now, maybe she had wanted to experience it. She felt that everything was new, this was like the popular customs of Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p>However, there was a disturbance. Qing Shui looked suspiciously at his surroundings. They were actually surrounded by at least 40 men. The ones leading them were two bald men. Their bodies were sturdy and tough. They looked very similar to each other, if they were not twins, they were at least brothers. At this moment, they were looking at Yu He. They seemed like they wanted to eat her up.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yu He and found that she was smiling gently at him. She seemed to be saying someone is bullying me, what are you going to do about it?</p>
 <p>“It’s the Tu Clan brothers. Hey, it seems that these two are outsiders. Are they being targeted by them.”</p>
 <p>“That is not strange, they can only blame the fact that this woman is too pretty. Now that they have their eyes on her, they are done for. Even the City Lord have to give them some face.”</p>
 <p>“These two seemed to be the descendants of some rich nobles. Why are they here in this unsavory place?” An old man shook his head and sighed before leaving.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the surroundings. It was a bustling place, but it was not one of those strong cities. He felt that they were not likely to be much stronger than Hundred Miles City. Then he looked at the two study men across him.</p>
 <p>An inhospitable environment has many wicked people. This place could be considered to be an inhospitable environment!</p>
