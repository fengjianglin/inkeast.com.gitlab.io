Luckily, he recalled the person who was healed by him a few months ago. Still, he wondered why the guy was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You remembered,” Beihuang Fan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do. Could it be that his balls are not working again?” Qing Shui asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan’s face flushed red instantly. This bastard did it on purpose. She did not say anything but simply glared at Qing Shui. Then she walked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad. You are more ladylike now,” Qing Shui said with a smile. He made sure that Beihuang Fan heard him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan’s mouth corners lifted to form a curve. She was as charming as a fairy. Meanwhile, Qing Shui started to head out from the backyard of the Imperial Cuisine, which was recently made. As he arrived at the front yard, he noticed Young Master Tai waiting there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood there alone and was very happy to see Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of the Star God Pendant as he saw Young Master Tai. After all, this fellow had gifted a powerful divine weapon to him. So, Qing Shui smiled, “What brings you here? Is it not working?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is not working? Ah, no no. You are a miraculous physician. It is great!” Young Master Tai did not know his meaning initially. He figured out when he saw Qing Shui’s eyeing his lower body part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Younger brother, I’m here to drink with you. I know an expert like you doesn’t care about the common things. I got two divine wines. I purposely came to share these with you,” Young Master Tai said as he took out a bottle of wine happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bottle was not big. It was about 1.5kg. The bottle itself was not flashy as it was painted in a plain and worn-out color. Yet, it looked very classy and outstanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never lacked any good wine; it was something that Young Master Tai did not know. However, Qing Shui was surprised when Young Master Tai opened the wine bottle. The reason was that the quality of the wine was not bad. It was on par with his own Tiger Bone Liquor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s wine was specially made with a secret recipe and it was kept for many years. This wine seemed to be exclusively made with a special recipe too. It looked like an aged wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t smell bad huh? Let us try.” Young Master Tai poured a bowl for Qing Shui before pouring another bowl for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and toasted with Young Master Tai. It had a fresh and thick fragrance in his mouth, as if a kind of delicacy were melting inside his mouth, its wonderful taste spreading throughout the body. All the senses were awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad! Where is this from?” Qing Shui nodded and asked out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This was produced somewhere in my place; this kind of wine relies on its age. If it is not kept long enough, the taste will be greatly reduced. This bottle of wine was from a collection, hence it tastes so good. The wine made by this person takes a long, long time to become this good. By that time, we would probably be old by then.” Young Master Tai said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is the name of this wine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Waft of Fragrance!” Young Master Tai said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you bring me to the person who made this wine?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure, but this person has a weird temper. She knows how to make good wine and she doesn’t sell it to everybody. No matter how much money people offer, she won’t sell a drop of it to them,” Young Master Tai said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, this personality is great.” Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Tai always reckoned that he was abnormal but he soon came to the realization that there were many people who were far more abnormal than himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui headed there straight after the conversation. After two hours, he rushed to the Pure Domain together with Young Master Tai.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pure Domain was further north to the Northern Emperor Domain and the Blazing Fire Land. But, it was in the same layer as the Northern Emperor Domain. However, the further north a force is situated, the stronger and the larger its land covered. Now, Qing Shui was bold because of his great skills. Thus, he headed to the Pure Domain alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui’s and Young Master Tai’s speed, they managed to reach the Pure Domain in two days’ time. That was owing to the Nine Continents Steps, Otherwise, it would take at least one week. This trip made Young Master Tai envious. He was able to save a lot of time when traveling with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the extremely wide streets, ancient and tall buildings were built and spread throughout the land endlessly. The crowd and beast vehicles were busy crossing and passing. There were people who wore the warrior and knight attires walking to and fro on the streets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people were riding on demonic beasts. Some were riding on the birds. Some were holding swords while some were holding bows and arrows. Some walked alone whereas some were in groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were young people wearing luxurious clothing and hugging ladies as they walked past. There were also the noble old men who went past in luxurious beast vehicles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui got used to a world like this, but he still had a special feeling every time he saw it. This was a world ruled by strength. This was an interesting world, filled with beauties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You saw a beauty?” Young Master Tai asked as he noticed Qing Shui stopping and looking at his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I don’t like to see beauties,” Qing Shui replied and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I forgot to tell you something. The one who made the wine is a beauty herself. This wine is passed in the family, but this beauty is slightly older. She was married but her man died before she could have any children. Her parents are also gone, leaving her alone to take care of the wine shop.” Young Master Tai said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You like her?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You will like her too when you see her. Although she was married, frankly speaking, this woman is no weaker than your women. If it were not for her marital status and her title of being a disaster, she would definitely be considered as the prettiest woman in the Pure Domain,” Young Master Tai said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, let’s not talk about this. We are here to check the wine. We will talk about the rest next time,” Qing Shui stopped the talk with this remark. He had some wine now, but there were not many types of them. This Fragrance Wine was not bad. After all, it was comparable to the Tiger Bone Liquor. If he knew the recipe, with the ingredients in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, he should be able to bring it to the next level. It would not be weaker than the Plum Blossom Wine and the Precious Dew Wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you address this wine maker?” Qing Shui thought of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Widow Qing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised by this familiar-sounding name. He had a brief thought and smiled. Still, he asked, “Could it be just ‘Widow Qing’?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Her name is Nalan Qing,” Young Master Tai replied.</span></p>

It was not easy to find a quiet place in this city. It was only relatively more peaceful here. It was more peaceful in here than the most bustling places. It could also be said that the living status here was lower than the most bustling places.</span></p>

But, there was a little sentiment. Many people around here were selling wine and it was crowded in every shop, except for the Fragrance Shack. It was quiet there, as if there was nobody inside.</span></p>

Moreover, they only sell fifty bottles. The wine shops around here borrowed the fame of the Fragrance Shack. When people can’t get wine from here, they will surely buy from those shops. Thus, all the shops nearby take advantage of its fame,” Young Master Tai explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You seem to know this quite well. You come here often?”</span></p>

However, this was indicating that they were not selling wine at the moment. Moreover, people here knew about this strange wine shop. Nobody gave face to it. Plus, the beauty was a disaster. Many people wanted to get this woman but apparently they failed. Some of them even ended up in a terrible way.</span></p>
