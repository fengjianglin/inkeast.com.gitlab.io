 <p><strong>AST 1449 - Yan Zhongyue Returns Home, 40 Years Apart, Reunion</strong></p>
 <p>Afterwards, Qing Shui naturally prepared a sumptuous dinner. The girl was praising the food while she stuffed her face. She was the type that had a way with words to get on the good side of people. Qing Shui could tell that the young girl was spoiled by the entire family.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made many dishes and left them many items. Since he did not have much to do, he used his spare time to conduct acupuncture to nurture the other’s constitution a bit. This way, they could enforce their foundation which could bring long-term benefits to their strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui even helped the woman. Though on the surface her strength looked like it was similar to Qing Shui’s, she probably would receive the inheritance from the old man, just like Yan Zhongyue. The Battle God Clan was more than ordinary.</p>
 <p>This type of Battle God Inheritance, legend says that it was similar to the one Qing Shui had received. At the end, there could only be one person who would receive this inheritance. As expected, this woman was the one who would receive it due to her bloodline.</p>
 <p>Typically, inheritance occurs when the person’s lifespan was coming to an end or when the person received a critical injury, buy it could also happen out of normal circumstances. However, once the person passed on their inheritance, there could be a loss in the strength that was being passed on. If the old man passed the Battle God Inheritance to the woman right now, the Battle God Technique’s power would be halved and this was something that could not be recovered.</p>
 <p>A martial artist’s martial realm was far too important. If the realm was lost, then there would be no strength. If they met another martial artist that was in the similar high-ranking realm, the opposition could easily strike them down. Battle techniques required a higher level in order for its power to increase.</p>
 <p>Yan Zhongyue had gotten help from Qing Shui on reconstituting his foundation. Now, Yan Zhongyue’s strength was similar to the woman’s. He had also learned the same Dragon Sabre Battle God ability and battle techniques that the woman knew. The only difference was that he did not receive the old man’s inheritance.</p>
 <p>Some things were very difficult to cultivate to a high level without an inheritance.</p>
 <p>Now that the old man’s lifespan increased by quite a bit, he would naturally be not required to pass on his inheritance early. After all, they were young and they required the support of the old man. If it had been the situation from before, the old man would need to pass his inheritance within a couple years since he only had less than ten years of lifespan left.</p>
 <p>With the increase in the old man’s lifespan, everyone was ecstatic. The old man was the family’s pillar and was also the pillar of the Great Yan Dynasty. The presence of a formidable martial artist acted as a form of intimidation.</p>
 <p>With the old man around, Qing Shui felt more relaxed. Without the old man, he would feel a strong sense of danger. Even though he still could not afford to lower his guard right now, he was more relaxed than he had been before. He knew that the old man would keep his eye on the movements of the Soaring Dragon Organization’s Patriarch.</p>
 <p>Today, Qing Shui decided to stay in for the night and would return home tomorrow. The old man had the woman take out several things for Qing Shui, and he did not hesitate. He saw that most of them were medicinal herbs that have aged, some of them at least 10,000 years old.</p>
 <p>Once the old man knew that Qing Shui was an Alchemist and a Doctor, he naturally knew that the most valuable things to him were medicinal herbs. However, he doesn’t need just any medicinal herbs, those that were not aged at least 10,000 years would not interest Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui did not disturb Yan Zhongyue from his family gathering. Instead, he went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>As he sorted the large number of medicinal herbs given to him by the old man, Qing Shui could identify that many of them were herbs for refining the Yang Pill, Nine Revolution Golden Pellet, and Fortune Pellet. Moreover, their age was perfectly suited for refinement. The only thing was, Qing Shui had not yet collected all of the required herbs to create the pellets. It would still require some time before he could collect all of the required herbs.</p>
 <p>In terms of tempering treasures, some of the treasures owned by Qing Shui have already lost their effect. However, he was not in a rush since the process wasn’t one that could be rushed. Slow and steady wins the race and eventually, he would be successful. At that time, his beast’s strength would also double.</p>
 <p>Without much to do, Qing Shui cultivated the Divine Truth Hearing Technique!</p>
 <p>Cultivating this technique was not too difficult but getting it perfected was not an easy task. Once Qing Shui started his cultivation, he would not feel tired. When he was hungry, he would eat. When he was sleepy, he would sleep. Unknowingly, two months within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had passed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s eyes sparkled as he sighed. In his previous life, he knew that listening skills had good utility. The strongest martial artists could use their hearing to determine positions. Now, Qing Shui could say that those skills were weaker in comparison to the Divine Truth Hearing Technique.</p>
 <p>Although he had only recently started getting the hang of it, he could hear sounds from anywhere within 100 li. Combining this ability with spiritual sense, hearing anything was absolutely easy. However, this did not excite Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>What excited Qing Shui was how he could utilize this ability on the battlefield. He could definitely hear and determine which area the enemy would attack, how much speed they had, and how big the attack was. Using this knowledge, he could prepare a response in advance.</p>
 <p>In fact, he should have thought about this from the beginning. Since humans’ senses included listening, it was of utmost importance. It could be more accurate than sight, since the image before the eyes may not always be real, but the sounds they listened to was absolutely real. Even in the False God Realm of martial artists, there were no attacks that did not make a sound. A normal person’s ear may not be able to hear it, but those who cultivated the Divine Truth Hearing Technique would definitely be able to hear it.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Divine Shrine’s abilities would not be awful. However, he had originally never thought of how useful it could be in the past. He started to think about another ability, the Duo Cultivation Technique. As he started to rest, he took it out and had a look.</p>
 <p>As he remembered the time when the Demon Lord was frightened when she first saw this nameless ability, he couldn’t help but laugh. He thought he should quickly return and then find a way for her to create a branch in the Great Yan Dynasty. This way, they would be able to take the fight to the Justice Alliance that resided within the Soaring Dragon Continent.</p>
 <p>The Soaring Dragon Organization appeared to be the strongest force on the surface, but he did not know if there were any formidable enemies in the woman’s personal foes. Soon, they will eliminate the Patriarch of the Soaring Dragon Organization, then they could quickly disassemble the forces within the Soaring Dragon Organization. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui recollected his thoughts and focused on the cultivation method of the nameless ability’s. This was a level up on the previous nameless ability that he had gotten in the past, it almost seemed like it was the next half of the book.</p>
 <p>The ability that was described by this book could allow Duo Cultivating couples to not only increase in strength by a lot but also make their strength more succinct. It could also open up many unbeknownst and miraculous acupoints and increase their Essence Force. Essence was the basis of a person, those who were full of Essence Energy were strong in every way. Even the ordinary people from Qing Shui’s previous life knew about the importance of being full of Essence Energy. A martial artist had a high requirement for Essence Energy, it made them several times stronger than the ordinary person.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not read very fast, but this nameless ability book was very thin and there were not many stances. In addition to the foundation he had developed from the previous nameless ability, learning this one would be quick. The only thing that remained was to put it into practice.</p>
 <p>…….</p>
 <p>The second day, Qing Shui, Yan Zhongyue, the old man, the woman, and the three siblings began their journey back to the Phoenix Dance Continent.</p>
 <p>In fact, the distance was not actually that far but the wasteland between the continents made it far away. If there was no distance between the continents, the travel would have taken only one day’s time. However, they needed a bit more time due to the extra distance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Five Elements Divine Flag, so he used the Five Elements Divine Flag directly and appeared in the Yehuang County of the Phoenix Dance Continent.</p>
 <p>In regard to Qing Shui’s ability, Yan Zhongyue was shocked. These last two days he had been shocked too many times, thus, he did not question it. Arriving here, Qing Shui decided to give Sou Hun a visit.</p>
 <p>Imperial Cuisine Hall!</p>
 <p>This place didn’t change from before, the man guarding the door recognized Qing Shui immediately. He said courteously, “Miraculous Doctor is here, please enter!”</p>
 <p>“Is Sou Miraculous Doctor here?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yan Zhongyue directly went up to the top floor. Once Sou Hun spotted Qing Shui, he gave him an emotional bear hug. Currently, there were two more doctors in here, one old man and one middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>Yao Qubing was here as well, he greeted Qing Shui courteously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui introduced Yan Zhongyue to Sou Hun. Qing Shui and Sou Hun were like brothers, thus, Sou Hun courteously called Yan Zhongyue, “Uncle!”</p>
 <p>Yan Zhongyue’s strength was formidable. With strength, the strong were recognized with status, those who progressed faster would become the first. Having a young-looking face did not necessarily mean that the person was young.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Sou Hun’s relationship was like this. If it was not because of this relationship, he would not introduce Yan Zhongyue. Sou Hun naturally understood this.</p>
 <p>Li Ji and Sou Hun’s son were currently not at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, they were out and about.</p>
 <p>They did not stay here for long, instead, they headed towards the Continent’s Capital.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Step!</p>
 <p>With the Nine Continents Step, traveling was still very fast. Moreover, the level of Qing Shui’s Nine Continents Step had increased. Now, he could travel from Yehaung Country to the Continent’s Capital much faster than before. After using Nine Continents Step, they rode on the Fire Bird. By the afternoon of the second day, they arrived at the Continent’s Capital.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could tell that Yan Zhongyue was very emotional, the closer they got to the Continent’s Capital, the more emotional he became. Qing Shui naturally understood why. During their journey, the two of them had many discussions and it was mostly about the Qing Clan. Yan Zhongyue now knew that Qing Shui had his own children, that Qing Qing was also married and everyone was at the Continent’s Capital.</p>
 <p>Continent’s Capital’s Imperial Cuisine Hall!</p>
 <p>Entering the gate, this was the Qing Clan’s main headquarters. Everyone in the Qing Clan that had resided in the Central Continent had already been moved here, even Qing Luo was over here as well. As long as everyone was together, anywhere could be considered home.</p>
 <p>The children in the courtyard were playing, the ones watching the children were Qing Qing and Huoyun Liu-Li. The two of them were happily chatting about something. Once Yan Zhongyue saw Qing Qing, his body shook for a second. Though Qing Qing had grown up, she still looked the same when she was younger.</p>
 <p>Qing Qing seemed to have felt something and glanced over. Once she saw Qing Shui, she smiled with happiness and walked towards him. Once she spotted Yan Zhongyue, she froze with her mouth wide open. Immediately, her eyes became red and tears welled up in her eyes, to the point where they began to roll down her cheeks uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>Yan Zhongyue’s eyes teared up.</p>
 <p>He slowly walked over!</p>
 <p>“Daddy, is that you?” Once Qing Qing saw Yan Zhongyue, she immediately ran over to hug him. Yan Zhongyue’s face had no major changes, Qing Qing’s recognition of him would never be forgotten. Just one glance, she could tell that was indeed her father.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, Daddy is unworthy of you. I have failed to care for you.” Yan Zhongyue embraced his daughter as he cried. He could not withhold his tears anymore.</p>
 <p>They were separated for 30 years. In his previous life, 30 years were considered almost a lifetime, luckily, they were in the World of the Nine Continents. Moreover, Yan Zhongyue did not leave willingly before and was still holding on to everything.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when he first regained all his memories, he wanted to know more about Qing Qing and Qing Yi.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, your daughter thought that she would no longer see you ever again in this lifetime.” Qing Qing was crying lightly.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li walked towards Qing Shui’s side. In terms of his father’s matter, there were not many that knew about it previously. They were aware that Qing Shui’s father was not around, but they had never thought he would suddenly show up.</p>
 <p>After a while, Qing Qing slowly released Yan Zhongyue. She had her arms around his shoulders with her eyes red from crying, but she was very happy. When she was little, she only had her father. It was her father that raised her for ten years. Once Yan Zhongyue disappeared, Qing Qing’s world collapsed. That was also the time Qing Shui saw Qing Qing, and why she became so depressed.</p>
 <p>At this time, everyone from the Qing Clan had arrived. Those who were at home all came out. Qing Shui saw his mother and grandfather and went over to greet them.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Yan Zhongyue saw Qing Yi. Separated for so many years and they finally reunited. It was a surprising, disconsolate, and an unbelievable feeling. A feeling that could not be described, but was filled with excitement.</p>
