 <p><strong>Chapter 337 Looking Coldly Upon the World, Misty Hall's Palace Mistress.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 337 Looking Coldly Upon the World, Misty Hall's Palace Mistress</strong></p>
  <p><span>While it was the first time Qing Shui saw this lady in person, he felt as if he had met her tens of millions of times, as it was as if she had walked straight out from that beauty portrait.</span></p>
  <p><span>When the Misty Hall's Palace Mistress saw Qing Shui, she was also stunned. Although this result was within her expectations, she was still extremely astonished.</span></p>
  <p><span>The man wore a thin light-colored nightwear, and exuded an aura which even she did not hate. Moreover, she could tell with one look that he was that man who had been rude to her in the dream with the sea of flowers.</span></p>
  <p><span>In that instant, the Misty Hall's Palace Mistress had the urge to kill Qing Shui, but as she looked into his clear eyes, she did not know why she did not do anything.</span></p>
  <p><span>Although she was being looked at with a infatuated gaze by Qing Shui, a gaze she had always hated, she also saw a tinge of complication in that pair of eyes. A mysterious color in those clear eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span>"If you don't mind, please come in and take a seat!" Qing Shui regained his senses and realized that it was the first time his heart had pounded so quickly. After all, such an event was especially amazing, and it was something that he would never have thought would happen.</span></p>
  <p><span>Without any guard, Qing Shui opened the path to the door, and smiled as he looked at the lady, and waited for her to come in!</span></p>
  <p><span>The lady hesitated for a while, then walked into the room gracefully. Qing Shui closed the door casually and walked behind her with a gap of 1.5 steps while he looked at her graceful steps.</span></p>
  <p><span>Only such a walking posture would be fitting of her figure!</span></p>
  <p><span>"Take a seat anywhere! I'll get you a cup of tea!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui had so many thanks towards this lady in his heart. After all, she was the same as Yiye Jiangye, and was a crucial turning point for his life’s path or rather, a point which "resurrected" him.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui poured a cup of tea and placed it before the lady. Qing Shui knew that it was very likely that she would not touch this cup of tea, but it was still an act of courtesy he should show.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Thank you!" After placing down the cup of tea, Qing Shui said softly to the lady.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui's words stunned Misty Hall's Palace Mistress for a short moment. She looked at Qing Shui's clear gaze, and felt puzzled, unable to understand why he gave her the abrupt thanks.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Why?"</span></p>
  <p><span>This was the third time Qing Shui had heard her talk tonight, but he was still infatuated by that magnetic and graceful voice. Just to hear her talk was a great enjoyment by itself.</span></p>
  <p><span>Her voice did not have seductive and intoxicating charms, and it would also not let one's imagination run wild, but it was the most beautiful voice in the world. Hearing it made one feel as if their soul was cleansed, which made one feel at peace, and even gave of a the feeling that everything about oneself would change together with it. It would &nbsp;turn very dignified and amazing.</span></p>
  <p><span>This was a feeling, but at the same time, a state!</span></p>
  <p><span>"It's nothing. You must be Misty Hall's Palace Mistress. With a head of beautiful tresses and like a &nbsp;beautiful goddess from the heavens!" Qing Shui exclaimed as he sat opposite her.</span></p>
  <p><span>While the Misty Hall's Palace Mistress was divinely beautiful, it had been a very long while since someone had praised her in person. One reason was that there was no opportunity to do so, and the second was that few people had the confidence to compliment her.</span></p>
  <p><span>It was because there were very, very few men who could hold their calm before her disposition and aura. Only when faced with an unparalleled beauty would one know what restrain was, and how unnatural it felt to be like that.</span></p>
  <p><span>Just like how Qing Shui was now, and felt very thankful and definitely did not hold any filthy thoughts towards her, he still felt a bit restrained before her. And this lady was one with very few words, so most people would find it hard to open her up. It could be something which only young children could do.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Do you usually praise women like this as well?" The lady brushed it off casually, and looked at Qing Shuil this time. Even if Qing Shui lifted his head to look at her, her gaze would not falter.</span></p>
  <p><span>"I don't compliment often. I speak only the truth." Under the lady's gaze, Qing Shui felt a bit guilty.</span></p>
  <p><span>It was because he recalled that this was how they had looked at each other back in that dream with the sea of flowers.</span></p>
  <p><span>He thought of the scene back then once again, but not because he wanted to be disrespectful to her!</span></p>
  <p><span>"Goddess?"</span></p>
  <p><span>"Demon?"</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui's hand casually moved to touch the lady's perky peaks!</span></p>
  <p><span>When Qing Shui thought of this, and he once again drowned into that amazing feeling, the lady's beautiful eyes narrowed slighty, giving off a killing intent. She once again had that feeling which made her feel extremely uncomfortable, the feeling as if an invisible hand was touching her...</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui recovered his senses from that killing intent, and looked at that lady awkwardly. The energy in his body had filled his whole body and detected the killing aura, but did not expose itself outside.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui suddenly thought of something as he suspiciously looked at the lady who appeared unnatural. However, he did not know what the reason was, nor why the lady had come to look for him today...</span></p>
  <p><span>"May I ask for the reason you've come to look for me today?" Qing Shui &nbsp;appeared to remain calm, and asked.</span></p>
  <p><span>Misty Hall's Palace Mistress remained silent for a while before she gradually spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Could you not ever think of what had happened in that dream, ever?"</span></p>
  <p><span>This time around, Qing Shui was really shocked. It seems like that dream had a similar effect to the Duo Cultivation dream he had with Qinghan Ye previously. Seems like she had also felt that dream.</span></p>
  <p><span>"You know of that dream? You know that I'll think of that dream often?" Qing Shui asked, surprised. He wondered if it was because it was possible for the souls of two people to be connected together.</span></p>
  <p><span>"The reason I've come to look for you today is just because of this. You are not allowed to think of me, especially what you did in the dream, I hope that you will never think of it again. I've had enough, do you understand..." The lady was very angry.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui looked dazedly at this lady's expression which appeared to be a bit angry at this moment. He would never have thought that each time he recalled the scene, she could feel it. Would that not mean that every time he touched her...</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui's face became instantly flushed. He wondered if he was too wretched. He had seen that portrait of the beauty many times in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and ever since he experienced that dream, each time he looked at that portrait, he would subconsciously think of the dream, and feel that amazingness.</span></p>
  <p><span>If that was the case, would it not mean that she would be touched by him many times a day? And &nbsp;most times, it would be at night!</span></p>
  <p><span>"I'm sorry, I did not know that this matter would bring you so much trouble. I'd never have thought that the person I met in the dream was you. It was becauses I didn't believe that such a beautiful lady would exist. I don't regret having done that at that time, but since it brought you inconvenience, I'll do my best not to think about it!"</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui rubbed his nose, spouting out the words nonsensically. However, his tone sounded very sincere!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui's honesty was unexpected to the lady. She looked at Qing Shui's slightly embarrassed expression, and she ended up feeling a bit strange. She, who had almost not come into contact with any men at all, now felt that men might not be that repugnant.</span></p>
  <p><span>She was abandoned by her father, and was sent to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord after her mother had passed away. Never would she have thought that after she had became an adult, they had wanted her to become the wife of Sky Tyrant Lord's son. Therefore, she escaped from there. She came across an extremely strong demonic beast on the way, and was eventually saved by the ex-Palace Mistress of Misty Hall.</span></p>
  <p><span>Now that she had broken off all relationships with her family. After her mother had passed away, her only remaining kin was her Master. And after her Master had passed away, she was left alone. She rarely interacted with anyone else, and everyday, she would just cultivate and cultivate...</span></p>
  <p><span>Even when Xi Ri was pursuing her, and caused a ruckus throughout the Heavenly Palace, she had not seen that man at all, nor did she have any interest to. If it was not that her Master had made her the Misty Hall's Palace Mistress, she would probably have went to live in seclusion. It was because she felt that those wild beasts were much cuter than men.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, what made her happy was that everyone in the Misty Hall was female, and men were forbidden from scaling the Misty Peak. Moreover, she was not one with a strong desire to excel over others, so she would almost never leave the Misty Hall, and had not even seen a man for over 10 years. </span></p>
  <p><span>To think that a dream had broken through her state calm being like still water. It had been many years since she had fought. That was why she had felt very contradicted when she met Qing Shui. She wanted to kill him, to regain her peace and calm, so that she could go back to the state where her heart remained peaceful like the water. </span></p>
  <p><span>However, her kindhearted nature had not let her do so. She was one with exceptional talent. If not, it would not be possible for her to achieve the towering level she was at within 25 years. And when she had started training, she was already 14 years old.</span></p>
  <p><span>She could only remember her Martial Uncle's gaze before she started to cultivate, and the blatant expressions of the many guys she had met. They were the cause of her deep hate and disgust towards men, and thus she had only appeared publicly in the Heavenly Palace once.</span></p>
  <p><span>Just this single appearance caused her to be well-known throughout the Heavenly Palace. Everyone knew that the Misty Hall's Palace Mistress was a beauty who could cause the fall of countries and cities, but most of them only had that single chance to glance upon her beauty and be astonished. Many others were only able to hear about her beauty by word of mouth.</span></p>
  <p><span>She was used to being alone, regardless if it was in reality or in her mind.</span></p>
  <p><span>She would act just like she was looking coldly upon the earth, neither interested nor concerned about anything else. She would not even concern herself with the matters involving the Misty Hall, but yet, she was like the soul of the Misty Hall.</span></p>
  <p><span>As long as she was in the Misty Hall, Misty Hall would be strongly united. It was why although she lived together with other people, she lived a life of seclusion.</span></p>
  <p><span>After her dream appeared, she felt troubled. Especially because she extremely hated men. She had initially wanted to kill Qing Shui directly, but when she came across that pair of clear eyes, she instinctively withdrew the intention to kill.</span></p>
  <p><span>A lady who had been living a life of quiet and loneliness, while Qing Shui had not touched her in real life, he left a deep impression on her in the dream. No matter if it was good or bad, it was something that was deeply engraved in her.</span></p>
  <p><span>She could never forget when Qing Shui spoke out, "Goddess?", "Demon?"</span></p>

 <p><span>"I don't compliment often. I speak only the truth." Under the lady's gaze, Qing Shui felt a bit guilty.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was because he recalled that this was how they had looked at each other back in that dream with the sea of flowers.</span></p>
 <p><span>He thought of the scene back then once again, but not because he wanted to be disrespectful to her!</span></p>
 <p><span>"Goddess?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Demon?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui's hand casually moved to touch the lady's perky peaks!</span></p>
 <p><span>When Qing Shui thought of this, and he once again drowned into that amazing feeling, the lady's beautiful eyes narrowed slighty, giving off a killing intent. She once again had that feeling which made her feel extremely uncomfortable, the feeling as if an invisible hand was touching her...</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui recovered his senses from that killing intent, and looked at that lady awkwardly. The energy in his body had filled his whole body and detected the killing aura, but did not expose itself outside.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui suddenly thought of something as he suspiciously looked at the lady who appeared unnatural. However, he did not know what the reason was, nor why the lady had come to look for him today...</span></p>
 <p><span>"May I ask for the reason you've come to look for me today?" Qing Shui &nbsp;appeared to remain calm, and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Misty Hall's Palace Mistress remained silent for a while before she gradually spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Could you not ever think of what had happened in that dream, ever?"</span></p>
 <p><span>This time around, Qing Shui was really shocked. It seems like that dream had a similar effect to the Duo Cultivation dream he had with Qinghan Ye previously. Seems like she had also felt that dream.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You know of that dream? You know that I'll think of that dream often?" Qing Shui asked, surprised. He wondered if it was because it was possible for the souls of two people to be connected together.</span></p>
 <p><span>"The reason I've come to look for you today is just because of this. You are not allowed to think of me, especially what you did in the dream, I hope that you will never think of it again. I've had enough, do you understand..." The lady was very angry.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui looked dazedly at this lady's expression which appeared to be a bit angry at this moment. He would never have thought that each time he recalled the scene, she could feel it. Would that not mean that every time he touched her...</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui's face became instantly flushed. He wondered if he was too wretched. He had seen that portrait of the beauty many times in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and ever since he experienced that dream, each time he looked at that portrait, he would subconsciously think of the dream, and feel that amazingness.</span></p>
 <p><span>If that was the case, would it not mean that she would be touched by him many times a day? And &nbsp;most times, it would be at night!</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'm sorry, I did not know that this matter would bring you so much trouble. I'd never have thought that the person I met in the dream was you. It was becauses I didn't believe that such a beautiful lady would exist. I don't regret having done that at that time, but since it brought you inconvenience, I'll do my best not to think about it!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui rubbed his nose, spouting out the words nonsensically. However, his tone sounded very sincere!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui's honesty was unexpected to the lady. She looked at Qing Shui's slightly embarrassed expression, and she ended up feeling a bit strange. She, who had almost not come into contact with any men at all, now felt that men might not be that repugnant.</span></p>
 <p><span>She was abandoned by her father, and was sent to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord after her mother had passed away. Never would she have thought that after she had became an adult, they had wanted her to become the wife of Sky Tyrant Lord's son. Therefore, she escaped from there. She came across an extremely strong demonic beast on the way, and was eventually saved by the ex-Palace Mistress of Misty Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>Now that she had broken off all relationships with her family. After her mother had passed away, her only remaining kin was her Master. And after her Master had passed away, she was left alone. She rarely interacted with anyone else, and everyday, she would just cultivate and cultivate...</span></p>
 <p><span>Even when Xi Ri was pursuing her, and caused a ruckus throughout the Heavenly Palace, she had not seen that man at all, nor did she have any interest to. If it was not that her Master had made her the Misty Hall's Palace Mistress, she would probably have went to live in seclusion. It was because she felt that those wild beasts were much cuter than men.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, what made her happy was that everyone in the Misty Hall was female, and men were forbidden from scaling the Misty Peak. Moreover, she was not one with a strong desire to excel over others, so she would almost never leave the Misty Hall, and had not even seen a man for over 10 years. </span></p>
 <p><span>To think that a dream had broken through her state calm being like still water. It had been many years since she had fought. That was why she had felt very contradicted when she met Qing Shui. She wanted to kill him, to regain her peace and calm, so that she could go back to the state where her heart remained peaceful like the water. </span></p>
 <p><span>However, her kindhearted nature had not let her do so. She was one with exceptional talent. If not, it would not be possible for her to achieve the towering level she was at within 25 years. And when she had started training, she was already 14 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span>She could only remember her Martial Uncle's gaze before she started to cultivate, and the blatant expressions of the many guys she had met. They were the cause of her deep hate and disgust towards men, and thus she had only appeared publicly in the Heavenly Palace once.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just this single appearance caused her to be well-known throughout the Heavenly Palace. Everyone knew that the Misty Hall's Palace Mistress was a beauty who could cause the fall of countries and cities, but most of them only had that single chance to glance upon her beauty and be astonished. Many others were only able to hear about her beauty by word of mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>She was used to being alone, regardless if it was in reality or in her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>She would act just like she was looking coldly upon the earth, neither interested nor concerned about anything else. She would not even concern herself with the matters involving the Misty Hall, but yet, she was like the soul of the Misty Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>As long as she was in the Misty Hall, Misty Hall would be strongly united. It was why although she lived together with other people, she lived a life of seclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span>After her dream appeared, she felt troubled. Especially because she extremely hated men. She had initially wanted to kill Qing Shui directly, but when she came across that pair of clear eyes, she instinctively withdrew the intention to kill.</span></p>
 <p><span>A lady who had been living a life of quiet and loneliness, while Qing Shui had not touched her in real life, he left a deep impression on her in the dream. No matter if it was good or bad, it was something that was deeply engraved in her.</span></p>
 <p><span>She could never forget when Qing Shui spoke out, "Goddess?", "Demon?"</span></p>
