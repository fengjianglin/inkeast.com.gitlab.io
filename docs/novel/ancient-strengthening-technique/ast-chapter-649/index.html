 <p><strong>AST 649 - Cure, Arrival of Yuan Su</strong></p>
 <p>“Isn't that what they said with your grandson as well?” Qing Shui smiled as he pierced the Gold Needle through Old Lady Mo’s Tianzhu and Kunlun Acupuncture points and gently massaged her.</p>
 <p>He also used the Saintly Hands to transfer his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique into Old Lady Mo’s meridians.</p>
 <p>In a flash, Old Lady Mo could already feel a refreshing energy flowing through her meridians. The painful and scorching feeling in her meridians was slowly beginning to fade.</p>
 <p>To other doctors, the injury to her meridians could only be treated with medicinal pills. Furthermore, they didn’t know much about meridians, dantian and Xiantian Qi and tend to be quite clueless on what steps they should take. Hence, quite often, they would only end up making the existing problems even worse.</p>
 <p>“Granny, how are you feeling?” Qing Shui noticed that the injury to Old Lady Mo’s meridians was more serious than what was shown from the outside. It was an internal injury. If this was to go on, she would very likely end up being crippled in a few decades.</p>
 <p>“I feel a lot better. Who would have thought that you would actually be a top-notch doctor at your cultivation level? You are already capable of treating meridian problems with your current knowledge of medicine.” Old Lady Mo said in gratitude.</p>
 <p>“Granny, it seems like your meridians might have been poisoned. I can’t say for sure yet, so I’ll only prescribe you some pills once I’m a hundred percent sure about it.” After thinking for a while, Qing Shui felt that Old Lady Mo was really important. Without her, the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death that was to be held in three days time would turn out to be really tough.</p>
 <p>“Actually, three years ago, I went to Evil Dragon’s Valley once. While I was there, I was hurt by a Scarlet Armored Poisonous Mink. It has been three years, normally, it would hurt once a month. If I perform any of my martial arts, I end up sick for up to half a month! My meridians feel painful to the point it feels like they are going to tear.” Old Lady Mo let out a sigh as she explained helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, this is fine. I’m quite good at treating things like this. Don’t worry granny, you will never have to suffer from this pain ever again.” Qing Shui said happily. Old Lady’s Mo’s injury was still something he was capable of curing. Her situation was actually quite similar to that of Baili Jingwei’s. Furthermore, Qing Shui has improved significantly in terms of his medicinal knowledge.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made Old Lady Mo sit on her bed cross-legged. After that, he performed Solid Constitution Nurturing Acupuncture. He also used the unique property of Gold Needles to force out the poisons from her meridians.</p>
 <p>It actually consumed quite a lot of his mental energy in order to perform that. Qing Shui’s Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was originally capable of nourishing and toughening meridians. With the help of the “Saintly Hands”, it’s effect was multiplied even further.</p>
 <p>Black droplets, with a fishy smell, could be seen dripping from the tip of the Gold Needle. This was one of the greatest benefits the Gold Needle has to offer, it was capable of removing poisons. It could be used to absorb the poisons and guide it out of one’s body.</p>
 <p>With the poisons removed from Old Lady Mo, things had become a lot easier for Qing Shui. He only needed to toughen the meridians and use the Thousand Year Silver Mugwort Leaves and other herbs to make a medicinal soup. The Thousand Year Silver Mugwort Leaf itself already possessed the ability to cure swollen wounds and damaged meridians.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly took away his Gold Needle. While doing so, he felt more relieved because he knew that once this was over, Old Lady Mo’s strength would definitely improve even further. To be more precise, she would be able to use all of her strength including that which she lost in the past.</p>
 <p>In the past, because of her damaged meridians, she was unable to withstand Xiantian Qi which was too powerful. But everything was different now, Qing Shui put down the soup and left behind a few Meridians Strengthening Pills which he refined in the past and a few other Medicinal Pills. However, he didn’t give her any Great Revitalizing Pills, for it would not be worth that period of weakness for a temporary boost in power.</p>
 <p>He asked Old Lady Mo to properly rest for these few days and take in some medicinal pills to stabilize her strength. This way, after three days, their chances of winning the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death will increase. If it's about fighting in groups, Qing Shui was somewhat confident that he could do it. Of course, that's if he didn't run into anyone insanely strong.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that it was very unlikely that the insanely strong peak Martial Saint experts in Seven Stars Country would take part in the tournament. There shouldn't be someone this strong in Ten Thousand Poisons Sect or else other forces in Seven Stars Countries wouldn't have been so relaxed and carefree.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Chen left Old Lady Mo’s room. At the moment, Qing Shui felt really relieved. This was because he had Old Lady Mo, who should be a Grade Ten Martial Saint, with him. However. Grade Ten Martial Saint was a crucial realm of cultivation that was unclearly defined.</p>
 <p>This was also what Old Lady Mo recently told him about. When one possessed five thousand countries worth of strength, they were considered to have stepped into Grade Ten Martial Saint. However, six thousand, seven thousand and even eight thousand countries worth of strength were still considered to only be Grade Ten. It was once said that the standard strength with which a person entered Peak Martial Saint was usually when they have around ten thousand countries worth of strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was unsure of Old Lady Mo’s strength. But hearing the way she spoke, her strength should be in the middle of Grade Ten Martial Saint, meaning she should have around five thousand five hundred countries worth of strength or maybe five thousand eight hundred at most.</p>
 <p>The medicinal pills that Qing Shui gave Old Lady Mo were particularly useful for Martial Saint Warriors in terms of strength. The medicinal pills provided an increase in strength, just like Qing Shui, if his raw strength was to be increased by ten countries, he would be able to draw out up to fifty countries worth of strength. If that's the case, Old Lady Mo would most likely be able to achieve a strength worth five thousand and eight hundred countries.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of his Emperor’s Qi and Fiery Golden Eyes. If necessary, he would summon the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and use the Vajra Subdue Demons. His Godly Force and Divine Shield Talismans could also help him increase his strength quite a lot. By doing so, he could increase Old Lady Mo’s strength up to a little more than six thousand countries.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued walking while thinking about his plan. The more he thought about it, the happier he felt. He was confident that he could kill them because if nothing went wrong, both him and Old Lady Mo would be able to challenge warriors with up to nine thousand countries worth of strength.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi was a skill which could reduce the opponent’s strength by twenty percent under any kind of circumstances. As for Fiery Golden Eyes on the other hand, it would reduce the opponent’s strength by a thousand countries under the condition of the opponent’s strength exceeding five thousand countries when it is in the small success stage. The Vajra Subdue Demons reduced the opponent’s strength by ten percent. For example, for someone with eight thousand countries worth of strength, the Emperor’s Qi would still reduce opponent’s strength according to the original eight thousand countries even after the Fiery Golden Eyes reduced it by a thousand countries. This was the terrifying part about Emperor’s Qi. Vajra Subdue Demons on the other hand reduced the opponent’s strength by ten percent.</p>
 <p>Hence, when Qing Shui encountered a formidable enemy, he would have to arrange all the skills in the proper order. By doing so, he would be able to reduce even more of the opponent’s strength. As for Emperor’s Qi, he would leave it as the final and the most fatal move.</p>
 <p>Every time Qing Shui thought about strong warriors getting tortured and beaten up, he would feel really happy. He couldn't help but smile. It's just that his smile looked really weird.</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking about? That smile is evil.” Di Chen shook Qing Shui’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Qing Shui touched his nose and asked Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, you often smile like that before doing something bad.” Di Chen said while holding his hand.</p>
 <p>“Bad things? No? Since when have I done bad stuff?” Qing Shui smiled and said. Now that he felt more relieved he wanted to tease Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“Humph, you have turned bad.” Di Chen said in dissatisfaction.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui picked Di Chen up in one go. Her body was really light but long. The curve of her body was perfect and felt soft. Qing Shui got so turned on that he just picked her up without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Di Chen’s surprised scream, Qing Shui said awkwardly: “I was charmed by you, that's a subconscious action. Don't worry, I'm not thinking of doing that kind of stuff……”</p>
 <p>“Put me down quickly, you’re getting more and more daring nowadays.” Di Chen sounded really gentle when she said it, she seemed like she didn't mind him doing it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that she was giving him more confidence. He felt a bit embarrassed but at the same time really happy and blessed. He couldn't help but say, “thank you!”</p>
 <p>“The last time I thanked you, you ended up hitting me…… now, tell me what I shall do.” Di Chen smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Why don't you hit me back?”</p>
 <p>“No! Don't be unreasonable.” Di Chen rolled her eyes at Qing Shui and interrupted him.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried her and walked around the room slowly. They shared gazes with each other. The kind of atmosphere in the room caused Qing Shui to feel an indescribable joy.</p>
 <p>“I noticed that I'm falling deeper and deeper for you. It's love, not the type that only thirsts for your beauty.” Qing Shui said gently. He sounded really natural and calm when he said it.</p>
 <p>“Well, I'll consider this sentence a redemption for you! You can put me down now.” Di Chen smiled gently. After that, she extended her hand and touched Qing Shui’s face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently put her down. As soon as he did so, he could already see Di Qing approaching them. Both Qing Shui and Di Chen once again looked at each other and smiled. He didn't know if Di Qing saw. But on second thought, he figured that it wasn't really important whether she saw it or not.</p>
 <p>This time, Di Qing didn't speak too much. As soon as she opened the door, she said: “There is an extreme beauty looking for you.”</p>
 <p>“Looking for me?” Qing Shui asked in confusion.</p>
 <p>“Quick, go, its Sister Yuan Su.” Di Qing rushed Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui responded to her and thought to himself that she came at a good time. He had planned to go look for her but it turned out that she came on her own. He wanted to see if he could ask for some great medicine recipes from her. They might be of help for the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death.</p>
 <p>He said his goodbyes to the two women and walked towards the main hall. As soon as he stepped into the front yard, he could already see a woman standing at the pavilion. She was a beautiful woman who didn't have any cultivation.</p>
 <p>Even when she was in front of women like Di Chen and Di Qing, she was not inferior to them. Especially that plain and simple aura which she gave off, it made her really attractive. Other than that, it was the wise look that she possessed when she was quiet that made her even more beautiful.</p>
 <p>She waved her hand after she saw Qing Shui. He approached her with a smile. This place was a pavilion that was not too far away from the hall. It was really secluded and quiet. From Qing Shui’s perspective, the extreme beauty really paired up well with the pavilion and together, it felt as if they had just formed the most beautiful of scenery.</p>
 <p>“You’re here!” Qing Shui smiled and greeted her.</p>
 <p>“Yeah! Who would have thought that Ten Thousand Poisons Sect would lose their cool in such a short time! Sister Qing and I are like sisters, Naturally, I'll be here to help you guys in the battle .” Yuan Su smiled as she hinted Qing Shui to sit down.</p>
 <p>“Help us in the battle?” Qing Shui’s eyes flashed. The Alchemist Sect has actually volunteered to provide them with aid…...</p>
