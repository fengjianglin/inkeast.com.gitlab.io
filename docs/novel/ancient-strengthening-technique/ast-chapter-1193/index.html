 <p><strong>AST 1193 - Gains and losses, A Profit, Legendary Grade Weapon, Blood Terminator Bead</strong></p>
 <p>Similarly, the energy of both the Seven-colored Pellet and Golden Pellet were also increasing. Suddenly, a huge message appeared. Qing Shui stood there in a daze. He was stunned because even he himself wasn’t sure whether this was a good or bad thing.</p>
 <p>His physical strength had finally achieved thirty five nimbus. He proceeded to sense it only to find that the Seven-colored Pellet had helped him increase his physical strength by fifteen times. Unfortunately, the Buddha Statue turned into a golden star within his sea of consciousness. But in exchange for that, Qing Shui could now utilize the Divine Nebula Formation to attack.</p>
 <p>A lot of the information in the messages which appeared in his consciousness previously were about the Divine Nebula Formation. The Golden Pellet within his Dantian was able to help double his strength. Not only this, it was also a passive kind of increase, in other words, it was a permanent increase. Qing Shui could increase it at any time he wanted.</p>
 <p>Hence, his physical strength could already be considered to have increased significantly. Although the strength of his spirit energy seemed to have gotten weaker, he had gained the addition of the Divine Nebula Formation to his arsenal.</p>
 <p>Physical strength that was worth thirty five nimbus… Taking into account the fifteen fold boost in strength provided by the Seven-colored Pellet, his physical strength had achieved nearly twenty seven thousand nimbus. In addition to that, the Nine Continents Mountain had also achieved a strength worth fifty three thousand nimbus.</p>
 <p>“Could it be what people usually say as “what you lose on the swing, you get on the roundabouts”?”</p>
 <p>By merely looking at these, things already seemed to be pretty good. On the whole, Qing Shui felt really happy. He quickly went on to sense the strength of his spirit energy. After all, his physical strength had already increased significantly. He could feel that it was stronger than before.</p>
 <p>As he started operating his spirit energy, he found it to be incomparably abundant. However, its explosive ability remained the same as before. After all, prior to this, the buddha statue could provide twice as much boost to his spirit energy. But now, without it, he could only do it once. Nevertheless, it was already fine the way it was now. Beside, he still had the Divine Nebula Formation.</p>
 <p>The Divine Nebula Formation was a killing formation formed rapidly when the spirit energy imitated the stars in the sky. It was all controlled by spirit energy. It was really profound and was considered to be a powerful killing formation.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Qing Shui wasn’t really interested in learning the Divine Nebula Formation. With his current strength, merely one Nine Continents Mountain was already enough to make him all the more terrifying, let alone his current spirit energy was also just as strong as before.</p>
 <p>However, the fact that the buddha statue disappeared made Qing Shui feel a bit uncomfortable. He remembered the Buddha’s True Eyes and got a bit nervous. He hurriedly attempted to use it and realized that it was still there.</p>
 <p>Buddha’s True Eyes!</p>
 <p>It was a very solid power. That was a kind of emotion…. A sorrowful, heavy, merciful as well as sympathetical aura instantly enveloped the surroundings.</p>
 <p>The Buddha’s True Eyes targeted the opponent’s heart. It attacked one’s mind and immediately aimed for the softest spot in a person’s heart. The Heart Toxin Talisman also had similar effects. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as orthodox as Buddha’s True Eyes.</p>
 <p>If an outsider was present when Qing Shui used the Buddha’s True Eyes, he would definitely feel that Qing Shui was like a tall impassable mountain, making himself feel spiritually pressured both physically and mentally.</p>
 <p>Of course, if it was someone who far exceeded Qing Shui in terms of strength, his percentage of success with the Buddha’s True Eyes would be low. Furthermore, its effect would be greatly reduced as well. This was a law that would never change.</p>
 <p>For now, other than the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, all of his strength has immediately turned into passive battle techniques. This made him feel as if his body was as strong as a divine stone at any time. However, his Ancient Inheritance helped keep his aura well-hidden. Very few people were able to examine Qing Shui’s true strength.</p>
 <p>The Violet Blood Thread within his blood seemed to have gotten slightly thicker. There was a majestic energy around it as well.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Qing Shui was unsure about the functionality of the Divine Nebula Formation. If he followed the rules from before, his physical strength would decrease by half but his spirit energy would double. But as Qing Shui thought about it, he thought it was quite a satisfying result as well. Despite losing the buddha statue, the golden pellet in his dantian was even stronger. Not only did it contain powerful Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and Violet Gold Divine Force, it could even help boost his strength onefold. This was already beyond the knowledge Qing Shui had towards Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>In a nutshell, Qing Shui was already considered to have gained a lot this time. The reason why he broke through this time was because he forged the Yang Stone Sword. It was the Yang energy within the sword which triggered a series of changes in his Nine Yang Golden Body.</p>
 <p>He suddenly thought about the Yang Stone Sword. Qing Shui quickly took out the sword. He remembered from before that at the time when he broke through, the Yang Stone Sword was also shining with golden light. He didn’t know that if it was him who broke through first or it was the Yang Stone Sword which shone first.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui used the Heavenly Vision Technique to look at the Yang Stone Sword, he once again froze in shock.</p>
 <p>A legendary grade weapon!</p>
 <p>He had actually forged a legendary weapon. Even though, at the moment when he broke through to the Hexa-color Rainbow Art of Forging, it was said that he had a small chance of forging legendary weapons, he never thought that he would be able to do it so quickly. It might have had something to do with the Yang Stone.</p>
 <p>Nine Yang Sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued reading downwards. Forged from Yang Stone. Imbued with Primordial Flame and Nine Yang Golden Flame. Contained formidable strength.</p>
 <p>Helped increase the user’s strength by tenfold. Increase fivefold spirit energy. The raw defensive strength which got increased twofold included the spirit energy defense, at the time when the user attacked, there was a 20% chance the power would be doubled. Nine Yang Force could protect the user from some negative effects, for example, from poison. It helped reduce the user’s energy consumption by 50% and help double the strength recovery speed.</p>
 <p>Can recognize its owner!</p>
 <p>State: Hasn’t recognized an owner!</p>
 <p>This was precisely how a legendary grade weapon was…….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he was really in luck this time for being able to forge the Nine Yang Sword. Unfortunately, this sword wasn’t his. Also, only this sword could help significantly increase his strength. Legendary weapons weren’t in the same class as high grade weapons. Those weapons were weapons that only existed in legends.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Nine Yang Sword as he reluctantly put it down. Compared to last time, this time, he felt even more impulsive to own this weapon.</p>
 <p>Last time, it was Yan Jinyu, Qing Shui thought for a long time and made up his mind to act foolishly yet again. The law could never change, after all, it’s always said that foolish people had foolish luck. Forget it, as Qing Shui felt that time was almost up, he made up his mind to only carve seal formations tomorrow.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui went out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the sky was already a bit bright. When he came out, he didn’t really mind the sun. When he arrived at the courtyard however, he saw a very thin figure of a person standing far away. Qing Shui was a bit saddened seeing that small figure standing there.</p>
 <p>“Why are you not sleeping more?” Qing Shui asked softly.</p>
 <p>The girl turned around: “I can’t sleep!”</p>
 <p>“Oh, then your body must be too frail. Come and practice fists with me!” Qing Shui pulled her to the backyard while talking.</p>
 <p>The girl’s hand felt really cold. Qing Shui slowly investigated her body with his spiritual sense. Originally, he only wanted to see if her body was healthy but after taking two steps, he abruptly came to a stop.</p>
 <p>“How old are you?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>“Fifteen years and ten months old!” the girl answered calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held her hand and once again walked towards the backyard.</p>
 <p>There were actually&nbsp;Blood Terminator Bead within her body! No wonder people called her the incarnation of Sirius. The reason why Qing Shui knew about the Blood Terminator Bead was because he has heard of it before from the Ancient Inheritance. It wasn’t actually anything like the incarnation of Sirius. It was a bead formed from very powerful resentment, baleful aura and pernicious aura. At the time when the girl reached adulthood, normally, at sixteen, it would burst. The girl would then turn into something which resembled a demon. She would be reborn into a new being and her strength would madly increase. When that happened, she would be very blood-thirsty and only be able to find peace through killing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if this was real. But now, since he was already able to make it here, what else could he not believe?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started to practice his Taichi Fist slowly. He explained the techniques while practicing them. He didn’t know if the girl would learn from him but he would definitely teach her. Taichi helped cultivate one’s mind and moral character. It also helped mediate one’s mind and relaxed one both physically and mentally. Qing Shui felt that he must have her learn it.</p>
 <p>Hence, he patiently practiced the fist while explaining to the girl again and again.</p>
 <p>One time… Two times…...</p>
 <p>A hundred times…….</p>
 <p>It was already past morning and yet Qing Shui still continued to explain about it. He tried to explain every single word in it and demonstrated them to her. All along, he looked really calm.</p>
 <p>The girl slightly lowered her head. After that, she started doing the Taichi Rising Hand stance. She performed the techniques one by one and seemed to have great talent for it. It might have been because she had seen it a lot and heard about it a lot. Hence, she could already pull it off nicely on her first try. On top of that, she was ever able to follow along to the pace of his breathing.</p>
 <p>She already seemed quite adapted to the style on her second try. Vaguely, it could be seen that her movement was quite smooth. Even though it wasn’t to the extent of looking very natural and unforced, no one would think that she just started practicing it when they saw her movements.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed her in silence. Whenever she made mistakes, he wouldn’t try to correct her right away. He would only demonstrate it again at the time when she stopped. The girl too knew which part of the techniques she wasn’t good at and would observe Qing Shui when he demonstrated it again.</p>
 <p>Just like this, another two hours passed. The pace at which the girl improved shocked Qing Shui. She could already pull off the Taichi Fist by herself. Qing Shui intended to let her suppress the baleful aura in her body with the Taichi Fist in the future.</p>
 <p>There was two months left. Qing Shui was a bit concerned. He didn’t know if she would go through great changes after these two months. He also did not know the extent to which her strength would increase once she got reborn by then. Would she kill him? Qing Shui believed that he would be able to run away but what about the people around here? Actually, those people weren’t really clear about what she was, if they had known about it, they would have done more than just kicking her out.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui brought her to have food, he could already feel a bit of change taking place inside her. It was something very hard to describe, he felt that it might have been a change which was taking place in himself instead. He felt that he was treating this girl like Luan Luan and Yu Chang, perhaps even Qing Yin and the others.</p>
 <p>Morning was already half gone by the time they finished their food. Yan Yangchi and the others came. This time, the Fifth and Seventh Princesses as well as Fourth Prince also came.</p>
 <p>At the time when they saw the girl beside Qing Shui, they were all stunned. The girl didn’t talk to anyone. Even when Yan Jinyu and the others approached her the start a conversation, she would just remain silent.</p>
 <p>“She was always like this, alright! Go inside!”</p>
 <p>Originally, the ladies still wanted to joke around with the girl. But every time they saw her, they would feel nervous. That was a very weird kind of terrified feeling. At first, they were just feeling uncomfortable but as time passed, they felt as if they overcame their feelings. After all, she was just an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you haven’t told us who she is?” Even the Seventh Princess had now begun to address him as Qing Shui. She asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“She is my long-lost daughter. I have finally found her. Let’s go, I have made some food today to return you guys the favor of helping me find my daughter,” Qing Shui said, while greeting the others.</p>
 <p>The others didn’t believe him. Nevertheless, they still smiled and congratulated him.</p>
 <p>The girl was already back in her own room. Qing Shui on the other hand, continued to drink alcohol with them. After all, it wasn’t time to eat yet, hence, there were teas and alcohol on the table. It was up to them what they wanted to drink.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t mention anything about the assassination attempt on him. Nor did he feel like saying it now. He felt that he had at least the ability to defend himself in Great Yu Dynasty, let alone he already knew some of the royal family members here.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, be more careful nowadays. Both Yu Clan and Third Prince may attack you. Why don’t you come stay in Yan Clan?” Yan Jinyu put down the cup of tea in his hand and asked.</p>
 <p>The Fourth Prince had begun to say something. Usually, he would speak very few words, hence, at this time, everyone listened attentively.</p>
