 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The face of the Sunset Palace Mistress instantly flushed red, down to her neck. She remained calm and silent, throwing a glance at Qing Shui. The three of them were used to joking around, and they were way too brilliant to guess her mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge threw that joke with nefarious intentions, as she was secretly observing Qing Shui’s response. However, Qing Shui acted in a negligent way and smiled without a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, Qing Shui had spoken a lot to the Sunset Palace Mistress and things were shady between him, Muyun Qingge and the Sunset Palace Mistress. At this moment, he couldn’t say anything regardless of the reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rarely took initiative in love, but he wasn’t really passive. For instance, he was the one who initiated and continued pursuing Tantai Lingyan, Yiye Jiange, and Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress and Muyun Qingge were not at all inferior to his other women, but he felt sorry out of his conscience. None of his women had ever tried to control or restrict him, and he had even thought of marrying multiple wives…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his past life, Qing Shui was the most ordinary man, who would be pleased to find an average-looking woman that he liked. He could only dream of having multiple wives. As for ruling the world and owning beautiful women, he could only watch such characters on television. He wouldn’t even have the chance to discuss it, because that would make him seem insane to others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui reckoned he would continue his past life in the current life. In his last life, he was an ordinary man, the most ordinary man. In the beginning of this life, he couldn’t practise martial arts and was fated to be useless. Following his blood awakening, he gradually stepped onto the journey of martial cultivation. He had achieved his current height through hard work and fortunate experiences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was known that strong men never lacked women, and Qing Shui believed in this saying. The capable men in his past life never lacked women. It was even more so in this life, where it was a norm to have multiple wives. Qing Shui’s women didn’t become his solely because of his strength, but it’s largely related to that. For example, it would’ve been tragic for Yiye Jiange to step into the Lion King’s Ridge if it hadn’t been for Qing Shui’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, Qing Shui realized that there were many women around him. He even noticed that he couldn’t handle it, not in a physical sense, but a spiritual one. He was the one who thought it was excessively unfair to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never considered that he would split up his love each time he met another woman. He applied his wholehearted effort in each of his women. However, that was a contradiction, as a man had only one heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Till now, Qing Shui finally figured out that it wasn’t true that he couldn’t devote himself fully to each of his wives, he was just worried about the relationship between his women, instead of their relationships with himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui seemingly fell deep into his thoughts. Memories were clearer now, such as why Yiye Jiange chose to settle down here, but not stay by his side. It wasn’t that she did not want to or that she didn’t love him, it was for a better love and relationship between them in the future. It was the same for her, Di Chen, Yu Ruyan, and Tan Taixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beauty came from its distance and love meant tolerance, to love all of him. Qing Shui’s women gave him the greatest space. Moreover, women had to keep themselves occupied in order to maintain their personalities and charms. They ought to be rather secretive. To be mysterious signified a kind of originality, making him feel that she was the most intriguing and enchanting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress saw that Qing Shui didn't notice her and could hardly conceal her disappointment with a fake smile, “It's so difficult to love someone. I'm not sure if I could have my own child this life. Jiange, you have to promise me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange smiled, “Elder Sis Qingcheng’s beauty is so remarkable and well-known throughout the nation. There are tons of men who dream of marrying you. It's a blessing for this little one to have you as his godmother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can't back out!” Sunset Palace Mistress said with a smile, not tangled with her love issues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge did not tease him further as she observed Qing Shui’s expression. They're women with pride too. Once such a topic had been brought up, it couldn't be further pressured, or else the feelings wouldn't be the same even if the wish was fulfilled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire banquet soon became dull after the incident. It largely affected the mood although the three Mistresses tried their best to liven up the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the feast, Muyun Qingge and the Sunset Palace Mistress left Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange in the room. This was also their private space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both of them adore you!” Yiye Jiange sighed softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled at Yiye Jiange, “What does Jiange want to say? Why the sigh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you like them?” Yiye Jiange stared at Qing Shui seriously, wanting to grasp any slight emotional stir in Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head lightly, “Jiange, I've said this before. To like is not to love. Everyone likes beautiful things, but I can't be marrying every beautiful woman. Don't tell me you like it when I have more women.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sat next to her and gently spoke, holding her waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange smirked, “What if I say that I don't mind it?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “I will spend my life protecting and loving my women. Though I feel that I'm avaricious at times, I truly love all of you deep within my soul. A man has to bear the responsibility to force this thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can feel that Elder Sis Qingcheng is head over heels for you. Don't men fall for beautiful women easily?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Silly girl. What's wrong with you today, you’re satisfied pushing me to other women?” said Qing Shui with a sad and hurt face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange laughed out of delight. She patted on Qing Shui’s head, “I dared not dream of everything today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, me too. I took you as my goddess and my master initially. Not an ounce of blasphemy existed. I could only feel ashamed and inferior before you. I could not conquer this mindset up till now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange blushed a little. Regardless of their actual relationship, she was his master by name previously, so it was rather awkward for the current change in relationship. Yet, it was warm and comforting now. It was the perfect ending for her. She felt great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I'm a woman... your woman,” Yiye Jiange murmured shyly. She needed to boost her man’s confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

Qing Shui spent the month idly and peacefully. He and Yiye Jiange were like the most ordinary couple. People envied them for being in love and so inseparable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought these days were busy, yet meaningful. He thought of a song from his past life, ‘The Most Romantic Thing’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the woman by his side, whose beauty was remarkable and unique across their generation. He couldn't help but whisper, “The most romantic thing that I could think of, is to grow old slowly, together with you…”</span></p>
