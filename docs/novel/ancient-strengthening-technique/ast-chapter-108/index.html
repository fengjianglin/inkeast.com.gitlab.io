 <p><strong>Chapter 108 Gongyang Yu’s fetish.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>AST 108 – Gongyang Yu’s fetish</strong></p>
  <p><span style>In the afternoon, when uncle Qing Hu returned, to everyone’s surprise, he brought along Qing Hu and Qing Bei as well. Qing Shui felt incomparably joyful upon seeing them!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Hu and Qing Bei, were obviously very happy to see him as well. Especially Qing Bei, she had long thought of Qing Shui as her brother. Now after half a year, they could finally meet again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Naturally, young people would love the lively, bustling atmosphere of the streets. Qing Shui as their host brought the two of them around Hundred Miles City while pointing out scenic locations, as well as places of interests.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Shui gege, this hairpin is so beautiful.” Qing Bei pulled Qing Shui along as she pointed to a green butterfly hairpin made of jade.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Boss, how much is this?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ahh, this young lady has such good taste. This hairpin could be consider top-grade among the merchandise I’m selling. How about 2 taels of silver?” The middle-aged female shopkeeper laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui paid the price for the hairpin, and handed it to Qing Bei. Looking at the radiant smile on Qing Bei’s face, he couldn’t help but feel joy blossoming in his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During the night, Qing Yi and Yuanying cooked a scrumptious meal for the Qing Clan members. Upon tasting the black fish and the turtle soup, the ravenous look on Qing’s Hu face caused everyone to break out into laughter. Naturally, this was the first time he had tasted the black fish.</span></p>
  <p><span style>——————</span></p>
  <p><span style>Heavenly River City!</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the majestic-looking main residence of the mayor of the Heavenly River City, a handsome youth was sitting in the courtyard, sipping his tea while admiring the flowers. This fellow had jade white skin, thin lips, and a pair of peach-blossom eyes. Somehow, even though he appeared to be lacking any hints of masculinity, and was more to the feminine side, people who saw him would think of him as a pretty boy rather than a sissy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master, Young Master Yang is here in the main hall. An old servant exclaimed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Got it.” The crisp sounding voice of the youth was tinged with civility, and filled with penetrating power.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He stood up and walked towards the main hall, which was the most impressive looking structure in the entire residence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yan Qi, you are here!” The youth enthusiastically greeted him once he saw Yan Qi.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yang Yan Qi was the descendant of the Yang Clan in the Heavenly River City. The Yang Clan could be considered a clan with substantial power, and had close ties with the Gongyang Clan. The two of them grew up together and were extremely close, just like blood brothers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Brother Yu, are you going to the Hundred Miles City?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Right, I can’t wait to taste the legendary black fish of the Yu He Inn. My hobbies are simple… beautiful women and good food! I definitely have to try the legendary black fish out.” Gongyang Yu touched his chin as he spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Brother Yu, I’ve heard some news.” Yang Yan Qi slowly stated as he looked towards Gongyang Yu.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What news? Why are you hesitating?” Gongyang Yu asked, puzzled. Usually, Yan Qi was extremely forthright and direct.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The little lass which brought humiliation to Lan Yan`er is currently in Hundred Miles City. Not only that, her brother Qing Hu, the one who wanted to woo Miss Lan is also there. They are both currently in the city now.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What? How do you know of this?” Gongyang Yu, asked with some suspicion in his tone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Situ Bu Fan from the Situ Clan told me. His fiancee was seduced by that bastard Qing Shui from the Qing Clan, and not only that, he was defeated by Qing Shui when he went to seek redress. Thus, he wished that by telling you this, you would help avenge him.” Yang Yan Qi stated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, what a useless fellow; he can’t even protect his fiancee. Of course I can help him. However, my condition is that I want to meet his fiancee. A woman that’s fought for by others, her beauty shouldn’t be too bad right?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gongyang Yu licked his lips as he grinned lasciviously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>——————</span></p>
  <p><span style>For a whole three days, Qing Shui brought Qing Hu and Qing Bei, touring every part of Hundred Miles City. In a mere three days, they had already spent a few thousand taels of silver.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, didn’t feel too terrible about it. After all, once a person was rich, he would start to flaunt his wealth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>These past few days, there were quite a few visitors with extraordinary status that visited Hundred Miles City. Sitting on a carriage, pulled along by a Flamekin Oxen, they attracted the stares of the crowd wherever they went. There were two middle-aged men seated in the driving seat. These two were none other than the driver and the beast tamer!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master, where do you want to go?” One of the middle-aged man respectfully inquired.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yu He Inn.” Gongyang Yu lazily exclaimed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The driver directed the Flamekin Oxen as they stopped outside the Yu He Inn.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What a aromatic smell!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As the carriage stopped, three people stepped out from the carriage. They were Gongyang Yu, Yang Yan Qi, as well as a solemn looking middle-aged man. </span></p>
  <p><span style>They had used a total of 3 days, and rushed over to Hundred Miles City. The earlier exclamation about the smell, was made by non other than the middle-aged man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Uncle Zhong, even you find the smell alluring. Seems like the reputation of the Yu He Inn is not unfounded.” Gongyang Yu was very respectful to this middle-aged man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let’s enter and verify the rumors about the taste.” The middle-aged man smiled. The smile on his face did not appear naturally, as if, forced… In fact, he looked even more fearsome smiling compared to when he was not.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The three of them strolled into the Yu He Inn, under the lead of a waitress, they sat down in a corner of the main hall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Give me three, no, give me six of your famed black fish.” Yang Yan Qi ordered the waitress attending to them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gongyang Yu was eyeing the uniformed waitress. Contained in his eyes, was a hint of an unconcealed expression of lust.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry, the black fish are sold out for today, could esteemed guest please order something else instead?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What? Sold out? We travelled over 1,000 miles to reach Hundred Miles City. Why would we even be here if not for the black fish.” Yang Yan Qi slammed his fist down onto the table.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gongyang Yu and the solemn-look man had no changes in their expressions. Gongyang Yu was still eyeing the waitress with a smile on his face, a twinkle in his peach-blossom eyes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir, the black fish are really sold out for the day, would you mind coming back early tomorrow morning if you insist on trying the black fish?” The waitress was still smiling, but traces of nervousness could be seen in her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“F*ck, a small inn in Hundred Miles City actually has the audacity to put on airs in front of this young master. Do you believe I won’t dismantle this building in front of your eyes?” Yang Yan Qi shouted, creating a huge commotion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Get the person in charge over here.” Gongyang Yu smiled sweetly to the distressed waitress.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes sir, please wait a moment!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>A while later, Yu He appeared in front of the three of them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Our apologies, esteemed guests. I’ve already instructed the kitchens to prepare the dishes for you. They should be served fairly quickly.” Yu He, from the words and the aura she sensed, knew that these three customers were people with extraordinary backgrounds.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are the one that decides matters for the Yu He Inn?” Gongyang Yu asked. He was immensely aroused by the beautiful features of Yu He.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gongyang Yu especially loved the feeling of f*cking young wives and widows. In Heavenly River City, he had tasted several. With his looks and status in Heavenly River City, he had no lack of women willing to sleep around with him. Once, in Heavenly River City, he had seduced a recently married young woman, and f*cked her right in front of her husband. Powerlessness and desperation eventually drove the man to commit suicide. Other than that, in another case, he had sent his men to drug a newlywed couple, killing the man and kidnapping the woman, before slowly playing with her. However, aside from his fetish for married women, his other hobby, was playing with widows.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Everything about Yu He, her features, her figure, the sound of her voice, and her every actions, deeply attracted Gongyang Yu. Obviously, he had done his research before they came to Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This Yu He Inn belongs to me, of course I make the decisions here. To apologize, let this meal be on me.” Yu He sincerely added.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A radiant light lit up in Gongyang Yu’s eyes as joy blossomed in his heart. “To think such a beautiful woman exists in Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;Not only that, she is my favourite type too. Just by looking at her face, I can tell that she’s of strong character. But the stronger the better, I like nothing more than this type of strong women under me, with their face filled with passion, as they submit to my every desire.”<br></span></p>

 <p><span style>“Let’s enter and verify the rumors about the taste.” The middle-aged man smiled. The smile on his face did not appear naturally, as if, forced… In fact, he looked even more fearsome smiling compared to when he was not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them strolled into the Yu He Inn, under the lead of a waitress, they sat down in a corner of the main hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me three, no, give me six of your famed black fish.” Yang Yan Qi ordered the waitress attending to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gongyang Yu was eyeing the uniformed waitress. Contained in his eyes, was a hint of an unconcealed expression of lust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry, the black fish are sold out for today, could esteemed guest please order something else instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Sold out? We travelled over 1,000 miles to reach Hundred Miles City. Why would we even be here if not for the black fish.” Yang Yan Qi slammed his fist down onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gongyang Yu and the solemn-look man had no changes in their expressions. Gongyang Yu was still eyeing the waitress with a smile on his face, a twinkle in his peach-blossom eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, the black fish are really sold out for the day, would you mind coming back early tomorrow morning if you insist on trying the black fish?” The waitress was still smiling, but traces of nervousness could be seen in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, a small inn in Hundred Miles City actually has the audacity to put on airs in front of this young master. Do you believe I won’t dismantle this building in front of your eyes?” Yang Yan Qi shouted, creating a huge commotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get the person in charge over here.” Gongyang Yu smiled sweetly to the distressed waitress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes sir, please wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, Yu He appeared in front of the three of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our apologies, esteemed guests. I’ve already instructed the kitchens to prepare the dishes for you. They should be served fairly quickly.” Yu He, from the words and the aura she sensed, knew that these three customers were people with extraordinary backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the one that decides matters for the Yu He Inn?” Gongyang Yu asked. He was immensely aroused by the beautiful features of Yu He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gongyang Yu especially loved the feeling of f*cking young wives and widows. In Heavenly River City, he had tasted several. With his looks and status in Heavenly River City, he had no lack of women willing to sleep around with him. Once, in Heavenly River City, he had seduced a recently married young woman, and f*cked her right in front of her husband. Powerlessness and desperation eventually drove the man to commit suicide. Other than that, in another case, he had sent his men to drug a newlywed couple, killing the man and kidnapping the woman, before slowly playing with her. However, aside from his fetish for married women, his other hobby, was playing with widows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything about Yu He, her features, her figure, the sound of her voice, and her every actions, deeply attracted Gongyang Yu. Obviously, he had done his research before they came to Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Yu He Inn belongs to me, of course I make the decisions here. To apologize, let this meal be on me.” Yu He sincerely added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A radiant light lit up in Gongyang Yu’s eyes as joy blossomed in his heart. “To think such a beautiful woman exists in Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;Not only that, she is my favourite type too. Just by looking at her face, I can tell that she’s of strong character. But the stronger the better, I like nothing more than this type of strong women under me, with their face filled with passion, as they submit to my every desire.”<br></span></p>
