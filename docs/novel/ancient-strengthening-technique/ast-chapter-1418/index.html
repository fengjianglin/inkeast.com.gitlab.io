 <p><strong>AST 1418 - Battle Pavilion, Set Off! Power Increase, Phoenix Battle Intent</strong></p>
 <p>After hearing Hua Rumei's words, Qing Shui laughed and said, "Don't worry, I'll definitely keep up."</p>
 <p>"Such confidence! It seems that you have a trump card!" Hua Rumei also laughed.</p>
 <p>"Yes, but I'm not sure if they're considered trump cards." Qing Shui said humbly. Actually, he did have trump cards like Emperor's Qi and Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix. Heavenly Technique and Phoenix Finger could also be considered trump cards. In fact, Qing Shui had a lot of trump cards.</p>
 <p>” There's no need to be reserved when you're with me. Anyways, you can show it off when the time comes. Don't ever let your guard down. Our enemy, the Dragon Palace has powerful warriors, even the Palace Lord might not find them as easy opponents."</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Ten days went by quickly, Qing Shui kept training as his main focus. During his free time he would refine medicine. He had some stores of Quadruple Portion Medicine. Qing Shui himself had taken two Four-Yang Pills. Hua Rumei had taken quite a lot, and he even gave a portion to the woman.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that having Hua Rumei deliver the medicine would have been better.</p>
 <p>Plus, during this period, he had added another skill to his Phoenix Form.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Battle Intent!</p>
 <p>Phoenix Battle Intent, a move that increased all allies' power by 10%, increased resistance to poison and stamina by several times, and increased the morale of allies. The radius of the area of effect is 3000 meters around the caster.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled at the thought of this technique. With only five more days left before setting off towards the Ancient Ruins, he had never expected to develop such a powerful skill. This was a group battle technique that increases every ability by 10%!</p>
 <p>Such an overpowered technique was truly frightening, especially when used with Emperor's Qi and Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix. Moreover, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant could increase power by around 30 million sun, 10% would be 3 million sun! 3 million sun was already equivalent to a Martial False God....</p>
 <p>After using these, a Martial False God's power would be completely different, Grade 5 Martial False Gods' changes were especially frightening.</p>
 <p>When allies' strength weakened by 30%, their strength would increase by another 10%. This did not even include the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's Vajra Subdues Demons, nor the Hellfire Phoenix and Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's suppression. Of course, whether or not the two suppressions could work together was still unknown, but it was very probable. Since his abilities were different than they were before, a bit of suppression was quite normal.</p>
 <p>With this, one would be able to fight someone twice as strong as oneself under normal circumstances. Realistically speaking, Qing Shui‘s Heavenly Technique could pulverize an opponent twice as strong.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Battle Intent increased the battle power of allies in its vicinity, an overpowered battle technique – the stronger the person, the more their power will increase.</p>
 <p>This battle technique was somewhat similar to Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, so it was not hard to learn. After all, the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique was a bonus from the Ancient Strengthening Technique, it was very suited for Qing Shui to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Currently, Qing Shui's abilities still could not be compared with the Demon Lord and Hua Rumei, but he was nevertheless a force to be reckoned with. He had his strong cripple and support, along with his terrifying Phoenix Finger and Heavenly Techniques.</p>
 <p>Five Elements Divine Refining Technique had also received a huge boost because the Paragon Heavenly Technique could decrease Qing Shui's technique cooldown by several times.</p>
 <p>During this period, Qing Shui took some Four-Yang Pills because of the Quadruple Portion Alchemy Recipe. Although the Four-Yang Pill could only increase base power by 1 sun or increase all powers by 100 sun.</p>
 <p>But that was not the extent of Four-Yang Pill, it could also strengthen the user's physique. The effect would enhance when used by people with excellent physique. If Qing Shui were to use it, every Four-Yang Pill would increase his base power by more than 1 sun.</p>
 <p>Because of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and Double Portion Medication, Qing Shui could only consume 20 more pills, but 20 pills were already enough to increase his strength by more than 60 sun.</p>
 <p>As of now, Qing Shui's raw strength was about 3 million sun, with the Nine Continents Mountain attack reaching 9 million sun as a backup for emergencies – it could even destroy opponents with power around 10 million sun.</p>
 <p>The strength of his spiritual force was even more outstanding, with the Seal of Roc attack exceeding 24 million sun.</p>
 <p>Although the Paragon Heavenly Technique was still the same, the Heavenly Techniques were still quite terrifying. Both the Paragon Golden Armor and Paragon Reversal were fear-worthy passive techniques. They do more than just increasing Qing Shui's power by twofold.</p>
 <p>This was the day, the last day of the half-month preparation. Qing Shui had almost finished all the Four-Yang Pills, and most of the remaining pills in his possession were already useless.</p>
 <p>Even the Ren Meridian and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets could not be used anymore. Even so, it was Hua Rumei who had gained the most without Qing Shui and the Demon Lord knowing. Since it was already given to her, they let her bring a long one portion.</p>
 <p>During this half-month, not once did Qing Shui see that woman, but he did meet with Hua Rumei on several occasions. The two genuinely looked like real brother and sister.</p>
 <p>In the Medical Pavilion, the Old Monster and the bunch treated Qing Shui very well. Naturally, Qing Shui returned their kindness. As the saying goes, when people gave me one foot of respect, I return them with ten feet of respect. This was how Qing Shui had always been.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's skills at using medicinal pills have earned almost everyone's respect in the Medical Pavilion. In the Medical Pavilion, medicinal pills are the number one priority, whereas training came second. Otherwise, it would be more practical to just enter the Battle Pavilion or the Battle Shrine.</p>
 <p>The Battle Pavilion was the one of the best at fighting amongst the 12 Earthly Branches, and their symbol was the Battle Shrine. This time, the Battle Pavilion and the Secret Service Pavilion were the ones going to the Ancient Ruins.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know much about the Battle Pavilion. Rather, he did not know much about the other Pavilions other than the Medical Pavilion. After all, the main reason he came here was because of that woman. There was no reason for him to understand the 12 Earthly Branches at all. As for the Medical Pavilion, it was just a way for him to get closer to the woman.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Today was the big day, the day of departure towards the Ancient Ruins, not the day of arrival. With their speed, they would not take long traveling to the Ancient Ruins, especially since they knew a shortcut.</p>
 <p>Late in the morning, they set out. The Battle Pavilion and the Secret Service Pavilion set out separately, looking out for each other, and Qing Shui got to know these two pavilions.</p>
 <p>There were only 800 people. Although it was not many, each and every one of them were elites. The Battle Pavilion striked an intimidating blood red Armour, whereas the Secret Service Pavilion dressed more normally, looking more like nobles.</p>
 <p>Though, the reason the Battle Pavilion wore such attire was because of the battle formation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood beside Hua Rumei. He was not the only one from the Medical Pavilion being sent. In every battle, the Medical Pavilion would be there with the warriors. After all, people get hurt in battles, and it was the doctors' job to save their lives.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei wore a black dress. Her cold beautiful eyes pierced the veil she wore just like stars in the night sky, giving off a majestic aura.</p>
 <p>The woman did not show up, so Hua Rumei was in command. As the men began fading away, Hua Rumei turned around and said to Qing Shui, "Let us start going as well!"</p>
 <p>"Okay!"</p>
 <p>A lot of people were speaking of rumors about Hua Rumei and Qing Shui. Ever since Qing Shui cured her, the pair seemed to have more than just a normal relationship.</p>
 <p>Some say Qing Shui was using this to blackmail Hua Rumei, with her body as the condition.....</p>
 <p>Some also say that Hua Rumei had a thing for Qing Shui and that she was the one who is being intimate with him.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei did not give a heed to these rumors. Who was she, to be affected by small rumors?</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei's mount is a Lightning Hawk about 10 meters high with shiny black feathers all over its body. It was only as strong as the strongest Martial Gods, but its speed was even faster than some False God Immortal Demons. This was a beast with frightening speed and endurance, specializing in stealth, flight and evasion.</p>
 <p>"Let's go, she's already waiting for us." Hua Rumei pulled Qing Shui's arm, mounting the Lightning Hawk.</p>
 <p>With a flash of black lightning, the Lightning Hawk vanished on the spot, speeding off as fast lightning.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had his hands held by Hua Rumei. They were soft and cool like jade. This sort of intimacy just had something to it, something indescribable.</p>
 <p>"What's with you being shy, I'm only holding your hand. Don't tell me you're having thoughts about me?" Hua Rumei laughed at Qing Shui, the latter of whom seemed uneasy.</p>
 <p>"Sister, you're also quite the beauty yourself, and I'm not that good at restraining myself." Qing Shui laughed, a bit more relaxed now.</p>
 <p>"I can't tell if you're praising or belittling me." Hua Rumei replied with a softer laugh.</p>
 <p>"Of course it’s a praise. This isn't a word that normal women are worthy of. By the way, Sister also understands the Mystical Gates Formation, right?" Qing Shui suddenly thought of it.</p>
 <p>"A little bit, I guess. Why'd you ask?" Asked Hua Rumei.</p>
 <p>"I have a set of formations here, have a look and see if you're interested. I think it'll be very useful to you. Mastering formations should make learning the Mystical Gate Escape Arts much easier." Qing Shui said, handing over a Nine Palace Steps cultivation scroll.</p>
 <p>"Oh, let me have a look then."</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei took it, and took an hour looking through it. After returning from her thoughts, she looked at Qing Shui and said, "This formation is at least Divine Grade, it's just that mastering it would be very difficult. This is already scary enough even without mastering it. I just realized that there's so much to be gained from you."</p>
 <p>"Ah, I too, gained a lot from you. Where else can I find such a good sister? Well, let's stop talking like strangers. You also don't want people to talk this way when they receive gifts, right? Giving someone something already means that it's okay, and that friendship exists." Qing Shui said laughing. He did not like it when someone gets cocky just because something was gained from that person. It made himself feel like he owed the person. If that was the case, he would rather keep the gift. Similarly, Qing Shui did not want other people to have misunderstandings when helping out other people.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Qing Shui spotted someone familiar. A giant Divine Turtle emerged from its hiding behind the clouds. Now Qing Shui realized that the head is that of a dragon.</p>
 <p>It was not a dragon head the last time he saw it. Somehow it transcended.</p>
 <p>Among the things that Qing Shui gave her were some things that beasts use, including an Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>"We meet again, young man. I'm glad that you didn't disappoint me." Qing Shui heard an old voice. Qing Shui went blank for a moment, then turned towards the giant Divine Turtle – the voice just now was definitely directed towards him.</p>
