 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s expression changed at the instant the Grand State Master disappeared. He extended his hand to grab the woman and immediately jumped away from the area. In just an instant, the spot where Qing Shui and the woman moved away from, got bitten to shreds by an enormous heavenly saber. Qing Shui didn’t think about whether or not he would be able to withstand it. One thing for sure, he knew that the woman would definitely not be able to withstand it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Somehow the Grand State Master already knew that Qing Shui would dodge it. His figure was blurry and couldn’t be seen clearly as he followed Qing Shui like a maggot that eroded bones. It continuously cut through the air and broke it into pieces, bringing up a series of black vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know how the Grand State Master got so fast all of a sudden. Furthermore, he even managed to break free from the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. This caused Qing Shui to be even more confused. Nevertheless, now wasn’t the time for him to ponder over these matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Shui didn’t go on to think too much about it, he was roughly able to figure out why. It was very likely that the Grand State Master was hiding some sort of treasure in him. It was this treasure which enabled him to escape from the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines and possessed the fearsome speed now. His strength has also been increased by a huge amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing which the martial arts in the world could never defeat was speed. In front of absolute speed, everything would turn into paper tigers. It was just like how a sparrow could puncture a hole through the metal wing of a plane. With enough speed, even an egg would become capable of breaking a stone. Nevertheless, it was without doubt that the egg would crush at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui believed that there must be a time limit at which he could maintain this condition. Not only so, but he even went on to hypothesize that there might be side-effects to such techniques. Certainly, these were all only Qing Shui’s assumption. But after spending so many years becoming the expert he was now, his assumption wasn’t made without a basis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, the Grand State Master was feeling very impatient at the moment. This young man was agile like a mudfish. Even after using the Wind Trace Protection, he was still unable to catch up to his speed. If his speed hadn’t been weakened before, he would have definitely caught up with Qing Shui by using the Wind Trace Protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s assumption was correct. The Wind Trace Protection was a pendant. It was unknown whether it was a Divine Artifact. It was capable of strengthening the bearer’s speed by two folds. The “Heart Protection” which it was equipped with, was capable of instantly making the bearer jump up from his previous realm which in turn multiplied his speed yet again by another two folds. The effect could last for half an hour. It could only be used once per day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thirty minutes could already be considered as a long time between the fights of expert warriors. Unfortunately, the person he ran into was Qing Shui. Unknowingly, half an hour passed, and he had still yet to touch the opponent’s sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was very enraged by it. To think that this young man would choose to dodge continuously… He never intended to face off against him directly like he already knew that there was a time limit to which he could maintain his condition. For a moment, however, he couldn’t think of any methods to deal with him. Once the Wind Trace Protection wore out, his chance of winning would be greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never thought for the battle which he initially thought would be a sure win for him to turn out like this. He didn’t understand how Qing Shui could move so fast. Most importantly, his body movements were also very unusual, making it very unpredictable from other people’s perspective. It was a feeling where the victim would feel hopeless in chasing after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the time being, Qing Shui didn’t dare to let down his guard. The opponent has already been enraged by the battle itself, not only so, he even specialized in using poisons. One careless mistake could lead to unbearable consequences. Before this, Qing Shui thought that the battle had ended with his Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, but he never expected that he would be chased down by the opponent to the point of exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, with the unusual Nine Palace Steps, even the current Grand State Master was unable to get a hold of him. If the opponent had been stronger, the Nine Palace Step might not have been as useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Palace Laws also played a huge part in assisting Qing Shui. The current Nine Palace Step has stopped making progress, after all, it was also closely related to Qing Shui’s own strength. However, the Nine Palace Laws on the other hand, was a lot stronger than before. Within a region with strong gravity, the opponent’s speed would be limited. Also, as its strength increased, even more energy was needed to activate it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Certainly, following the increase of the level, the energy consumed by Qing Shui in maintaining the Nine Palace Laws also became more significant. To Qing Shui however, this was still nothing. After all, the Yin-yang Image within his Sea of Consciousness was constantly replenishing his Origin Qi and Force of Rebirth. Even though he was still yet to be called a restless machine, there was already a very huge difference between him and other warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After fifteen minutes, the Grand State Master came to a stop and looked at Qing Shui who was a hundred meters away from him, “What do you know other than dodging?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never stated before that I am very talented, you on the other hand, what kind of a pussy are you? To not even be able to catch a person without any talent” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you are a man, have an honest battle with me. Do you have the guts to do that?” The Grand State Master tried to provoke Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not up to you to decide whether or not I am a man. But you know what? That thing of yours, it’s not that useful. Does it tend to rush down a thousand li at one go?” Qing Shui looked at the opponent’s private region and said in a disdainful tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t trying to talk nonsense. It was because he noticed it. To put it simply, because he has interacted with too much poison, he was inflicted with an annoying mixed poison, causing him to ejaculate very early when having sex. Nevertheless, sometimes, it was also functioning normally, but even then, the chances of this happening were three out of ten times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand State Master specialized in poisons. Naturally, he would also be proficient in the medical field. Despite all that, he was unable to solve his own problem. This might be what people usually described as “a physician was not capable of attending to his own diseases”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…...You…. You are talking nonsense!” Naturally, the Grand State Master wouldn’t admit it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman blushed and glared at the man that was beside her. He indeed has a very unrestrained mouth. They were already in such a life-and-death situation and yet he still had the mood to talk about things like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who do you think I am? I am a physician. If I am incapable of even noticing that, I wouldn’t have been able to open the Imperial Cuisine Hall. There is also nothing embarrassing about it. If you don’t attend to it, as time passed, it will get even worse. Eventually, it won’t even be able to erect at all. If an extreme beauty was to appear in front of you by then, you wouldn’t be able to do anything but to look at her.” Qing Shui continued on and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was trying to waste time. At the same time, he also wanted to input some pressure on the opponent. This man must die. There was no way he would make amends with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You unbridled brat! All you know is nothing but talk nonsense! I know my own body better than anyone else! What do you know? Your hair hasn’t even fully grown yet and you are already boasting so much! Die!” The Grand State Master seemed to know the situation very well. He highly doubted that Qing Shui would cure him. Besides, he also didn’t trust Qing Shui. Even if he did, what could he do with it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand State Master was also aware that dragging it on wouldn’t do him any good. The chance of him taking down Qing Shui would be even higher if he engaged him with the Wind Trace Protection still in effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even he himself didn’t know that this short conversation would cause his self-confidence to be damaged so much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui didn’t avoid him. He immediately summoned the Nine Continents Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Go!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous Nine Continents Mountain charged its way towards the Grand State Master. The strength of the NIne Continents Mountain has already exceeded ten million Dao Force. Added on the formidable ability of Shield Attack on top of it, the Nine Continents Mountain would be able to withstand the opponent even if he was superior in strength. Nevertheless, if the gap in strength was too large, the strength from Shield Attack would still prove to be useless.</span></p>
