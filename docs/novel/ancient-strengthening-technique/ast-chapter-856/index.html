 <p><strong>AST 856 - Buddha in One’s Heart, Buddha’s True Eyes</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed the elderly man who was clad in monk robes. They went through the main hall and into the inner hall. With his increased strength, Qing Shui was not afraid of any sort of danger since he knew he could defend himself.</p>
 <p>Perhaps the elderly man understood this, so when they entered the inner hall, he stopped and turned to Qing Shui, “ You have an affinity with Buddha, so you don’t have to worry.”</p>
 <p>When he heard this, Qing Shui smiled. This reminded him of the scenes from movies in his previous life when the hero saved the earth. However, he did actually feel like he had an affinity with Buddha.</p>
 <p>“Why?” Qing Shui wanted to know the elderly man’s thoughts. He could sense that the old monk was very powerful. If he hadn’t received enlightenment earlier, he would’ve never be able to defend against this man. However, as his strength had increased by a fold, he could do so easily now. This strength he received from his enlightenment did not require any time or effort for him to get used to. He could instantly control it perfectly.</p>
 <p>“You have the Nine Yang Buddha Body, which only appears every ten thousand years. You are blessed by Buddha. You might not believe me, but did you experience a sort of nirvana just now?” the old monk asked earnestly.</p>
 <p>“I did. I thought that it was just a coincidence that I felt enlightened. Is that the meaning of having an affinity with Buddha? I guess that must be quite common.” Qing Shui did not ask any further about the Nine Yang Buddha Body. It was quite obvious that he had that body constitution.</p>
 <p>“I looked for you today because I wanted to discuss something with you,” the old monk looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I am not interested in becoming a monk,” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>“We don’t need you to be a monk. We just need you to register your name here at the Golden Buddha Temple. We would be very grateful to you,” the old monk quickly replied.</p>
 <p>“I would like to know some basic information about your temple,” Qing Shui said after he thought about it. After all, he had obtained a great benefit from this place, so he did not mind registering his name here. Besides, he was not familiar with anyone in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. It was just that he did not want to be restrained by anything if he did register this name with the temple.</p>
 <p>“I am an ascetic monk of the Golden Buddha Temple. There are many like me here. The Golden Buddha Temple was once a branch of the Central Continent Buddha Sect. However, even though it was a branch, there wasn’t really a true connection. It was more a tacit agreement. This not only applied to the Golden Buddha Temple and the Buddha Sect. There are other branches that exist in a similar manner after being abandoned by the Buddha Sect.” the old man explained calmly.</p>
 <p>“So how many branches does the Buddha Sect have now?” Qing Shui remembered that there were nine sects: Buddha Sect, Joyous Meditation Sect, Diamond Sect…</p>
 <p>“Just as before, they have nine sects. But now, they are all in the Central Continent. The other temples outside have already established themselves as independent sects. Regardless, these sects still borrow the influence of the Buddha Sect in the Central Continent.” the old monk shared openly.</p>
 <p>The old monk’s frankness impressed Qing Shui. He looked at the man and asked, “If I registered my name, how would this help you?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not understand why this man had said so much to him. He was never going to be a monk so he did not see how this would benefit the organization.</p>
 <p>“I have no idea, but I know that it is a rare opportunity to meet someone with the Nine Yang Buddha Body, so we don’t want to miss this chance. We don’t need you to do anything and we won’t restrict you with any of our rules even if you register with us,” the old monk understood that the young man did not wish for any obligations.</p>
 <p>“If you agree to my request, I’ll bring you to see the Abbot,” the old man watched Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Come in. No one will force you if you’re unwilling. We will not put you at any disadvantage.” Just then, a resonant voice rang out that seemed to come from all directions. The voice sounded forceful and wise, yet incomparably kind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old monk without giving much reaction, acting as if he had not heard that voice. He smiled and urged the old monk, “Old Elder, please lead the way!”</p>
 <p>They walked through the inner hall which was filled with many Buddha statues. However, these statues were about human-sized and there were fewer of them than outside.</p>
 <p>After they passed through the inner hall, they arrived at a smaller shrine that was within the hall itself.</p>
 <p>“Please enter, I will wait here. The abbot is waiting inside.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui exchanged a few pleasantries and entered the shrine.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not feel calm as he could sense that the abbot was a very powerful man, so powerful that he was unable to gauge his exact strength.</p>
 <p>When he entered the shrine, he saw another Buddha statue similar to but smaller than the one facing the entrance.</p>
 <p>There was a prayer mat in front of the statue, upon which an old man was kneeling. He was facing away from Qing Shui and his white hair was so long that it reached the floor. Even if he was standing, it would probably go past his waist. He wore a white kasaya and was extremely thin.</p>
 <p>“Sit!” the kind voice spoke as the old man turned slowly.</p>
 <p>With his gaunt face, the old man looked emaciated. Somehow, he looked very kind. He had a rosy glow and his very long white eyebrows drooped to his chest.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Abbot.” Qing Shui replied as he sat down on his knees on the praying mat three meters away.</p>
 <p>“Young sir, do you believe that Buddha exists?” the abbot asked in his kind world-weary voice.</p>
 <p>“I do!”</p>
 <p>“Then, do you know where Buddha is?”</p>
 <p>“Buddha is in my heart!”</p>
 <p>“What a brilliant reply. As expected from someone with the Nine Yang Buddha Body.” The old man seemed exceptionally happy.</p>
 <p>“Nine Yang Buddha Body?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could recall the many Buddha-related experiences he had. Since he was in a temple, it was good to believe in Buddha. Having a religion wasn’t necessarily something bad, and it didn’t really have much of an impact on him whether he believed or not.</p>
 <p>“Actually you don’t have the Nine Yang Buddha Body, or rather there is no such thing in this world. Rather, you have a special rare body constitution with an extremely Yang nature, perhaps due to the techniques you practice. This state is also known as Nine Yang and it is very powerful…” the old man explained succinctly. This made it easy for Qing Shui to understand and accept his words.</p>
 <p>“This is just as I thought.” Qing Shui smiled, replying.</p>
 <p>“You are one of the most considerably intelligent people that I’ve met in my lifetime. Unfortunately, although you have Buddha in your heart, you do not have the interest in that path.” The old man smiled faintly, not revealing his true feelings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was quite surprised that the old man knew, but he was relieved. The old man’s wise eyes seemed capable of boring into one's mind. Since he had revealed some things about himself, the old man must have noticed based on his extensive experience.</p>
 <p>“You have seen through me.”</p>
 <p>The old man shook his head, smiling,”Let’s just talk today. Don’t worry. You don’t have to register your name here. As long as you have Buddha in your heart, that’s enough.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. The old man’s words were profound. Without any warning, he had stealthily created a situation which drew Qing Shui in. Qing Shui felt a little uncomfortable interacting with someone like that, but at least he didn’t feel totally exposed.</p>
 <p>“Since fate has made us meet each other, I will give you this. You might find it useful.” The old man handed a piece of flyleaf to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated. He did not know what it was and he did not want to owe anything, so he did not reach for it.</p>
 <p>“Take it. It’s simply fate. You don’t need to feel burdened.” the old man smiled, seeming to see through Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t seem right.” Qing Shui felt a little embarrassed since he had received such a great benefit from the temple and now he was actually going to accept another gift.</p>
 <p>“Take it. Be decisive. It is not a good thing to be too calculated,” the old man said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took it as it would make him look fake if he didn’t do so at that point. “Thank you!” he said to the old man.</p>
 <p>“You must be from somewhere foreign,” the old man said casually.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>“So you need information.” the old man laughed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded.</p>
 <p>“I am aware of the goings-on in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. Since we have this fated encounter, you can go ahead and ask me about anything. I will answer you if I can.” The old man was ever so kind and composed. His expression did not change much and he was almost as calm as a stone statue.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed that the old man understood him. The old man was offering him as much as he could. Even Qing Shui felt that this was the best approach.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui scanned the paper and saw two words: Buddha’s Eyes!</p>
 <p>Buddha’s Eyes!</p>
 <p>Buddha’s True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked and quickly kept it in his Realm of the Violet Immortal. After that, he looked to the old man and asked, “Can I go to the Sky Penetrating Mountains now?”</p>
 <p>The old man looked at Qing Shui and laughed, “Yes. But it would be best for you to bring a group of experts along with you. You might find yourself struggling otherwise. It is very dangerous there, so do take care.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui chuckled. He agreed with the old man, but he did not know whether to laugh or cry at his suggestion about bringing other experts.</p>
 <p>“There are many formidable top-tier clans and sects in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. Abbot, can you name a few, so that I am prepared?” Qing Shui said after some thought.</p>
 <p>“There are so many. I will give you a few names. With your current strength, these are the few that you should avoid offending.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grinned, “Abbot, you are overestimating me.”</p>
 <p>“The powerful groups start from here all the way to the east. They are the Sky Prison Sect, Godly Sword Clan, Tyrant Fist Sect, Poison Mountain Stockade, Silken Web Ridge, Dongfang Aristocrat Clan, Mu Clan…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered these names in his heart. These were important for him in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent as he remembered the old man’s words.</p>
 <p>“You can go, but bring a group of experts along with you.”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui thought of this, he knew that the old man chose his words carefully. He wondered if the old man meant to advise him to get companions before venturing there.</p>
 <p>“These sects and clans are all found in the most eastern city of Eastern Victory Divine Continent, the Eastern God Country. It is very close to the Sky Penetrating Mountains, so there are people who explore those mountains. You can go there and have a look.”</p>
