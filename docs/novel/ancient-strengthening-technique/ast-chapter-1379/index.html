 <p>AST 1379 - Yelang Clan's Great Loss, Phoenix Dance Amalgation, Dongye Clan</p>
 <p>Yelang Wuji's power wasn't too much out of Qing Shui's expectations. Earlier on, he had only sensed their approximate abilities and had a rough gauge. It was just that the other party didn't sense his own abilities.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu's abilities were very vague as well. They might have been able to sense that she was only at Grade One False God but she still had six demonic beasts. Furthermore, they were Early Grade Three False Gods!</p>
 <p>Yelang Wuji had already passed by one False God Tribulation. The False God Tribulation between Grade One False God and Grade Two False God was the easiest to break through. However, this was also where the most number of people die from tribulation. It was because there was the most number of people who reached this grade.</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, Qing Shui called out the Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain could now reach a power of close to two million sun, reaching Peak Grade One False God. It had three times Qing Shui's speed and that powerful Shield Attack. Even Yelang Wuji, who had just passed through the first False God Tribulation wouldn't be able to receive the attack so easily.</p>
 <p>"Make your move. If you don't, then I will." Qing Shui put his hand on the Nine Continents Mountain which was directly before and above him.</p>
 <p>Sunmoon Light Void！</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun's brows furrowed tightly and swung his Sunmoon Constellation Sword. The skies within the surrounding 300 meters turned extremely dark. However, the Sunmoon Constellation Sword he was holding in his hand was extremely brilliant. It was as if the sword had absorbed all the light in the surroundings.</p>
 <p>An immense power emitted from the Sunmoon Constellation Sword. Suddenly, Yelang Wuji looked toward Qing Shui with gleaming eyes. With a leap, he charged out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>However, he charged upward at an inclination and not dash out straight toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Sunmoon Strike！</p>
 <p>A piercing glow flashed on the Sunmoon Constellation Sword flashed and a crescent shaped Origin Energy Wave exuded the brilliance of the sun, slashing out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"His battle technique isn't bad. To think that he can bring Early Grade Two False God to close to the level of Peak Grade Two False God." There was no anxiety on Qing Shui's face at all. This level still did not bring him any sense of danger.</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's hand slapped down hard on the Nine Continents Mountain, which then charged out toward the energy wave, its speed fast as lightning.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>With a tremendous sound, the energy wave disappeared. The Nine Continents Mountain also was slammed back for a distance from the collision.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's figure suddenly appeared behind the Nine Continents Mountain and his hands brought out a huge golden roc!</p>
 <p>Seal of Roc!</p>
 <p>The strength of the Qing Shui's Seal of Roc had exceeded five million sun and Yelang Wuji's strength hadn't even reached three million sun. Yelang Wuji's countenance changed drastically on seeing the Seal of Roc. He could sense the dangerous aura that was exuding from it. Even if he could receive the attack, he would at least suffer from serious injuries.</p>
 <p>Sunmoon Protection！</p>
 <p>The Sunmoon Constellation Sword in Yelang Wuji's hand exuded a white glow that encompassed Yelang Wuji completely.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>The huge explosive sound caused the surroundings to be blasted into smithereens.</p>
 <p>The Seal of Roc collided against it, releasing a deep sound and then disappeared. The glow surrounding Yelang Wuji disappeared as well.</p>
 <p>Sunmoon Divine Movement！</p>
 <p>Two balls of light appeared under Yelang Wuji's legs, just like the sun and moon. Yelang Wuji made his move and his speed was several times faster than it was previously.</p>
 <p>In terms of speed, there were not many people at the same level as Qing Shui who could be a match for him, let alone Yelang Wuji who wasn't as powerful as him. Therefore, even after Yelang Wuji used the Sunmoon Divine Movement, his speed was still no match for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Snake Elephant's Movement!</p>
 <p>Spirit Snake Exits Cave!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved, bringing out a stream of Primordial Flame Dragon Whip, launching the Spirited Snake Movement lashing out toward Yelang Wuji, striking on his body.</p>
 <p>This lash had a strength exceeding 2.6 million sun, about the same power level as Yelang Wuji. When struck by an attack of the same power as himself, he still had to suffer from some light injuries.</p>
 <p>Divine Dragon Tailwhip！</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept lashing out his Seal of Roc non-stop. He no longer used the Seal of Roc but used the Seal of Roc at his greatest power. This was the first time he was using his Seal of Roc against his enemy.</p>
 <p>From the very start, he might lack a little fluency but his mastery increased gradually. At the very beginning, Yelang Wuji could handle it with ease but it got increasingly harder for him and eventually, he was lashed with wounds all over by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Yelang Wuji didn't even manage to touch Qing Shui's sleeves. He was a far cry for Qing Shui in terms of speed and strength. If it was not because Qing Shui was trying to practise the Snake Elephant's Movement and was also for the sake of Tianhe Renmo, Qing Shui would long have caused Yelang Wuji to at least suffer from serious injuries and lost terribly. If he were to use the Paragon Heavenly Technique, he would be able to have an instant kill.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>With another lash, Yelang Wuji was sent flying back while spurting blood.</p>
 <p>"You've lost!" Qing Shui's calm voice rang out.</p>
 <p>The people from Yelang Wuji were all stunned. Yelang Wuji was one of most outstanding in their generation but before this young man, he had no means of retaliating. Another reason was that the Seal of Roc this young man had performed earlier had an even greater prowess.</p>
 <p>"It's too unbelievable. To think that such a young man could defeat Yelang Wuji." There were people below who were stunned.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Yelang Clan had wanted Yelang Wuji to bring them up another notch. To think that someone even younger than him had beaten him up and he wasn't able to retaliate in the least."</p>
 <p>"There's no need to fight anymore. Yelang Clan had already lost."</p>
 <p>"But there's still one more round. Maybe Yelang Clan may win?"</p>
 <p>"Regardless whether they win or not, Yelang Clan has already lost. Why else would Yelang Wuji came out? As long as Yelang Wuji were to win, everything would be fine. But with him having lost, it would be considered to be Yelang Clan's lost. They have lost completely."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Sigh, we've lost!" Yelang Qiankun said this line with a deep sense of fatigue.</p>
 <p>Yelang Wuji experienced an even greater sense of loss. He was the most outstanding person amongst people of his age but he hadn't expected that someone so much younger than him would be more powerful than him. And the person was so much more powerful in comparison.</p>
 <p>"There's still one more round. Do you guys still want to continue?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"We'll continue. This time around, I'll be the one to fight. Which one of you will be my opponent?" Yelang Qiankun once again lit up his fighting spirit and said.</p>
 <p>"Me!"</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu stepped on the air and appeared directly next to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Call out the White Tiger directly. Two of them to protect you and four of them to attack." Qing Shui said that and retreated to a distance away.</p>
 <p>"Young Miss, make your move!" Yelang Qiankun said to Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>It was the first time that the lecherous Yelang Wuji was in no mood to think about anything when he saw a beauty like Yehuang Guwu. The blow that Qing Shui had dealt him was enough to keep him depressed for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu didn't say much and smiled as she waved her hands, condensing one White Tiger after another.</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu sent four of the White Tigers toward Yelang Qiankun. The latter was a Peak Grade Two False God but the White Tigers were at Early Grade Three False Gods. Therefore, Yelang Qiankun's burning spirit only lasted him the time for a few breaths before he suffered a terrible loss.</p>
 <p>"Did I see wrongly? To think that this lady had defeated Yelang Qiankun just like that. If this lady were to fight against Yelang Wuji, wouldn't it be an easier win..."</p>
 <p>"Monstrous talent, demons... Birds of the same feather really do flock together. They're really a good match."</p>
 <p>"Like I said, there's no need to fight anymore. Yelang Wuji has lost. Yelang Clan has brought even more shame upon themselves. This couple should have an even stronger power backing them up. I wonder what kind of power would nurture this pair of demons."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun had also suffered from serious injuries but he didn't seem to care too much about his injuries. He stayed in a daze for very long before he said to Qing Shui, "All the things from before will be written off and Yelang Clan will fully support your setting up of the Imperial Cuisine Hall in the continent's capital. And may I ask who Physician wants me to help to search for?"</p>
 <p>"Get them to go back. We'll talk after we go down!" Qing Shui said that and then landed toward the manor with Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>"You guys can go back. I'll make the decision in this matter. Don't say anything else." Yelang Qiankun spoke with a grim countenance.</p>
 <p>The other people left and Yelang Qiankun landed.</p>
 <p>"Please take a seat!" Qing Shui invited Yelang Qiankun to sit down. Their positions were as the previous time but it was just that the mood was completely different now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui brought out a portrait and passed it to Yelang Qiankun. "Take a look at this person. He's the one I'm looking for."</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun took the portrait from Qing Shui but when he saw it, he was taken aback. "It's no wonder that I find you a little familiar. You're looking for him?"</p>
 <p>"That's right. Are you able to help me get news of him?" Qing Shui said sincerely.</p>
 <p>"Yelang Clan is unable to help Physician on this." Yelang Qiankun let out a sigh and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything nor ask if Yelang Qiankun knew of this person. Yehuang Clan had told him a piece of news that the continent's capital didn't allow them to investigate this person. Therefore, he merely looked at Yelang Qiankun.</p>
 <p>"It's said that he's the head of a powerful force but I don't know who he actually is. Although I'm unable to help Physician, there's a clan that can help you. As long as you have the abilities, then go look for Dongye Clan. They should be able to give you a satisfying answer. If you aren't strong enough, it's best that you don't go," Yelang Qiankun said softly.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. Oh, right. Can you tell me about the Dongye Clan?" Qing Shui felt that the Dongye Clan's should have a unique status in the continent's capital.</p>
 <p>"The continent's capital has a powerful circle of forces and you may be able to enter it very soon. This Organization is known as the "Phoenix Dance" and Dongye Clan's status in this circle shouldn't be weak. The one that Yelang Clan has the most contact with is the Dongye Clan." Yelang Qiankun went straight to the point.</p>
 <p>"Do you know what level the strongest of the Dongye Clan is at?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and asked.</p>
 <p>"I know that they have people at Grade Four False God level and Grade Five False God level as well. I don't know if they have anyone who's stronger. The higher the grade at the False God level, the higher the chances of failing. Therefore, there aren't many people who can pass the fifth False God Tribulation."</p>
 <p>Grade Five False God level was considered nothing to Qing Shui now. The Paragon Golden Armor had allowed Qing Shui's defense to reach a terrifying level. However, what Qing Shui was afraid of was that there would be the Heavenly Technique at the later phase of the False God realm. It could allow one's abilities to get a lot stronger. This was the thing that he was worried about.</p>
 <p>It seemed that he would have to go pay a visit to the Dongye Clan after some time. This Phoenix Dance Organization seemed to be very powerful. It should be the group that Yehuang Clan had mentioned. Whether or not he would join this group would depend on the nature of the group.</p>
 <p>If there was a need, he would join the Demon Lord Palace.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked in the direction outside the continent's capital and thought to himself, "Wait a little longer. I'll go look for you very soon. And that person who is supposed to be my father... What kind of person are you?"</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun left. Qing Shui had no idea if there would be any more people from the Yelang Clan coming to regain their reputation. Anyway, the shame that Yelang Wuji had brought was gone for good. It didn't mean that no one else would come knocking on the door but it would have to depend on whether Yelang Wuji had sufficient influence in the Yelang Clan.</p>
 <p>From the afternoon onward, people started coming to visit Qing Shui, inviting him to their place. There were also people from great clans. Everyone saw Qing Shui's potential and many people also knew of Qing Shui's influence in the Yehuang City's Imperial Cuisine Hall. Therefore, they were all here to get into his good books.</p>
