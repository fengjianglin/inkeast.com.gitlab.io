 <p><strong>AST 1325 - Longeitivity Noodles, The members of the Pang Clan are here, Pang Shitu, Accident</strong></p>
 <p>“To think that it is really treatable.” Sikong Tonglang looked at Qing Shui in shock. Right now, he had only recovered a little but this was just like a lamp shining in the darkest night. It had managed to guide him towards a desirable direction and showed him hope.</p>
 <p>Old Man Sikong had actually also sensed it. Despite this, he found it a bit hard to believe. With Sikong Clan’s family background, it was easy for them to look for the best doctors and alchemists, yet none of them had proven to be capable of treating such illness.</p>
 <p>“Old man, we will bid our farewell first. I will come here every two days to help treat him. If everything goes well, I can guarantee that he will be back to normal within half a month,” Qing Shui stood up and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I have already finished setting up the banquet. No matter what, you two must stay today. I have found almost every famous doctor around here but only now did I notice that there are a lot of people with unearned reputations. I am going to leave the matters regarding Tonglang to you two miraculous doctors.” Old Man Sikong was very friendly with Qing Shui and Soulsearch.</p>
 <p>“Old man, we still have other things we need to do today. Someone is still waiting for us to save their lives. Let’s wait until we totally cure Tonglang’s illness first. By then, we will have a drink together, how do you feel about that?”</p>
 <p>Since words had been spoken up to this point, Old Man Sikong could no longer stop Qing Shui. He reluctantly let go of both of their hands and said with a smile, “Alright then, we have made a deal with each other. We must drink together once Tonglang is cured.</p>
 <p>“Alright, we will definitely do that!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>They visited quite a few clans within a day. These clans all had special patients in their houses. All these patients were very important, at the same time, they were also patients who needed urgent treatment. Qing Shui managed to make a few connections while helping them cure their illnesses. More importantly, Qing Shui’s medical expertise had also been passed down throughout the area.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui’s reputation has also been passed down along with his medical expertise. Of course, that also included the Jade Steamed Buns and wines.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the grudge Qing Shui and Pang Clan harbored against each other was circulated around as well.</p>
 <p>Pang Clan!</p>
 <p>Pang De was drinking his wine. There was a middle-aged man who looked like a scholar standing in front of him. That man gave people an impression that he was a very profound and mysterious man.</p>
 <p>“Brother Pang, how are you planning to deal with the brat? That brat will definitely evolve into a frightening existence in the future if you continue letting him do as he pleases. He is a doctor. If this goes on, within less than a year, he will definitely be a very influential character.” The middle-aged scholar took up the wine cup and took a sip of the wine.</p>
 <p>“In three days, I plan to eliminate him no matter what it takes,” Pang De said firmly after hesitating for a while.</p>
 <p>“You sure?”</p>
 <p>“Yi He, is anything wrong?”</p>
 <p>“I keep on having the feeling that there is no point doing this to just a doctor. It just doesn’t seem worth it,” the middle-aged scholar who went by the name Yi He said while looking at Pang De.</p>
 <p>“The words have already come out of my mouth. I can’t afford to embarrass Pang Clan. Besides, he may have been just a doctor, even if he may be able to achieve great things in the future, killing him now is just as easy as squeezing an ant to death.” Pang De’s killing intention was very firm.</p>
 <p>A trace of disappointment flashed across the eyes of the middle-aged scholar. Nevertheless, he didn’t express it. On the contrary, he continued to drink alcohol with Pang De.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Puyang Clan.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, were you looking for me?”</p>
 <p>A mature middle-aged man said with a smile while approaching Old Man Puyang’s courtyard.</p>
 <p>“Honghu, there is finally hope for Zhengming to stay alive. But it seems we have got trouble these few days. The person going by the name Qing Shui from Imperial Cuisine Hall is able to save her, it’s just that it seems Pang Clan is plotting something against him. Please help pay close attention to him in secret and save him when necessary,” Old Man Puyang said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, don’t worry, since there is someone who is able to save Zhengming, Puyang Clan will definitely protect him,” Puyang Honghu said joyfully.</p>
 <p>Zhengming had the same pronunciation as fighting for life. It was the name of the little brat which Old Man Puyang was with the other day. It meant for her to fight for her life from god.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At the same time, Sikong Clan, along with a few other clans, seemed to have made the same move. At least they were all planning to get into the good graces of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui returned to Imperial Cuisine Hall, he immediately went into the realm. Today, he started fiddling with the Longevity Noodle.</p>
 <p>Even though there wasn’t a lot of Longevity Fish, the quantity was considered somewhat valuable. It’s also already enough to be used. The reason being that he still had the crystals produced by the Crystal Lion. This way, it would have been enough for the Longevity Fish to slowly merge with the bits of the crystal.</p>
 <p>The Jade Steamed Buns had finally become popular. Furthermore, its popularity was still increasing. Now, people found whoever managed to eat the buns from Imperial Cuisine Hall as a kind of identity and pride. It had already managed to achieve these within just a few days time. It was also this that triggered Pang Clan to stalk them. Causing Pang Clan to come up with the intention to conquer Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>It had only been a day and there were already more customers on the fourth floor of Imperial Cuisine Hall. His position had also gotten a lot higher compared to before. In an instant, he helped significantly raise up level of Imperial Cuisine Hall. The people who left prior to this all felt regretful to the point even their intestines turned green.</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, Pang De was also the other one feeling regretful. If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have mentioned the three day limit. Even though it had only been one day, he already knew that Qing Shui wouldn’t come. It was already impossible for Pang Clan to get him into the Pang Clan. So long as he refused to join them, there would definitely be people coming out to support him now.</p>
 <p>But the Pang Clan couldn’t throw away their own face. Back then, they had already made their words very clear. How could they patch things back up at this time? They could only hope that others wouldn’t act on the matter on that day. Or rather, they could choose to use softer methods when they acted. This way, they might just be able to keep their face.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, Pang De has started feeling unconfident with himself.</p>
 <p>On the second day, the Longevity Noodles had been made. Both Old Man Puyang and the little brat were here. These were all for free. For now, on the fourth floor, other than paying once a year, the remaining things needed to cure disease were all for free. This kind of rule was almost similar to that of the clubhouses from his previous incarnation.</p>
 <p>This time around, the main thing was to advertise. Maximum effect can only be achieved by eating that on birthdays, hence, they made a promise to deliver the longevity noodles to people during their birthdays.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, three days passed. Today was the day when Pang Clan was going to come. Naturally, Qing Shui waited for them inside Imperial Cuisine hall.</p>
 <p>Around noon, the people from Pang Clan came. This time, around ten of them headed over. Each of them was on an enormous Cloud Lion Beast. After that, they dropped down from the sky and landed in front of the door of Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui, Soulsearch and Li Ji had long since gotten the news.</p>
 <p>Not long after the people in Pang Clan stood outside the door, Qing Shui and his group came out.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of people in the surroundings. Back then, a lot of people were aware of what Pang Clan said three days ago. Hence, since early today, there were already people paying close attention to the things around here. Furthermore, more and more people came here. There were even plenty of aristocratic clans among them.</p>
 <p>A lot of the inns across the street were rejoicing in the misfortune of others. A lot of people had been jealous of Imperial Cuisine Hall, seeing Qing Shui joining them and the changes which occurred for them. Of course, there were also a lot of people trying to defend it, since they got their illness treated there.</p>
 <p>Even though the customers here were all wealthy people, they would still spend time heading over to treat their illnesses on the first floor. Not only this, the treatment was free, hence opening up free medication, even to the commoners. One thing though, they had to be ordinary commoners. For the bad, the evil, the rich but arrogant, and people who bullied others, Qing Shui would never treat them no matter how rich they were. He had already enforced this rule since the time back when he was in the five continents.</p>
 <p>For example, for clans like Pang Clan. Even if he had had no conflicts with them before, once he was made aware that they had this kind of characteristic, it would be impossible for them to turn into Imperial Cuisine Hall’s customers no matter how rich they were. Those were clans that resembled that of an evil tyrant.</p>
 <p>“It has been three days. You haven’t come to Pang Clan so I came here today to realize the things which I said the other day.” Pang De looked at Qing Shui and took the initiative to talk.</p>
 <p>He was really loud. He did this to tell the people that Pang Clan would do what they promised and he hoped that no one would get involved in it. To the Pang Clan, losing their face wasn’t something which everyone could accept.</p>
 <p>“I have said it before. I am not interested in working with people like you. Could it be that you want to level this entire area just because I refuse to work with you?” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui didn’t speak loudly when he spoke, everyone around him was able to hear what he said clearly.</p>
 <p>“People from Pang Clan, they have always been forceful with others. I reckon that they most probably wanted to own the entire Imperial Cuisine Hall just because they felt that they could gain benefits from it.”</p>
 <p>“Oh yes, I also wonder why no one has stopped Pang Clan yet. There are still Yehuang Clan, Puyang Clan and Guhu Clan…… There are so many clans which are capable of levelling the entire Pang Clan, why do they choose to not care about it?”</p>
 <p>“Well, this, you don’t know. It’s because a clan like Pang Clan exists for the reason to show the contrast between the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ clans. This is also why no one eliminated Pang Clan even though they are not used to seeing the way they do things.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was listening to the discussions around him. It seemed there had to be a reason for something if it existed. This was an unwritten rule.</p>
 <p>“Pang Clan never bullies people. How about this, we will fight three rounds today and the first to win twice will be considered the winner. If I win, you will have to promise to work with Pang Clan. If you win, I will call off the things about us working together and apologize to you. What do you think?” Pang De seemed to have realized something. His tone changed immediately.</p>
 <p>“Are you telling me that if I win, an apology is all that I will get?” Qing Shui looked at Pang De.</p>
 <p>Pang De stunned, “Well then, say what you want then, I will take whatever it is.”</p>
 <p>“Right, we will fight and decide the winner with one match. If you guys win, I will follow the condition you suggested just now. If I win, in the future, Pang Clan will never again be allowed to step on this street.” Qing Shui was really calm. But what he said could make one’s blood boil when they heard it.</p>
 <p>Something worth noting was that across Yehuang Country, other than a minority of aristocratic clans, clans at the level of Pang and Sikong Clan were the ones that were the strongest. Of course, there were still a lot of clans around the country. After all, Yehuang City was still really huge. There were only roughly ten of them around the Pang Clan’s power level in this area.</p>
 <p>The corner of Pang De’s mouth twitched. He had already embarrassed himself. He then replied with an upset face, “Alright, I will accept your condition.”</p>
 <p>Before this, he thought he could smooth things over with an apology. However, Qing Shui had already indicated that he couldn’t be bothered receiving this ‘apology’ at all. Instead he said he didn’t want any of the Pang Clan members to set foot on this street and in another words, this meant that the sight of Pang Clan members are so disgusting that they turned the stomach of people looking at them...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui casually looked around his surroundings. He sensed that someone was paying attention to him. But that aura was very gentle. It didn’t contain any evil intentions. Hence, he stopped worrying about it and skywalked.</p>
 <p>Pang De clenched his teeth and was about to rise up. But right at this moment, he suddenly spotted a Cloud Lion Beast flying towards here from far away. At the moment when he saw the old man on top of it, he got really agitated. He politely waited for the old man to arrive in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Third Uncle!” Pang De politely greeted him.</p>
 <p>The old man had a very tall and sturdy body. He looked slightly older than Pang De. But he was still only considered to be slightly but not too old. Because, the fact that Pang De had a face which looked like a mature middle-aged man had to be taken into account.</p>
 <p>“Understood, alright. Close yourself into seclusion when you get back.” The old man’s eyes were like engraved lacquerware. They looked really cold.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Pang De’s body trembled. Despite this, he still responded politely.</p>
 <p>The old man took a glance at the surroundings, “Nobody can step on our Pang Clan’s pride.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the old man finished speaking, he immediately skywalked. He was like an enormous bird, fast like lightning.</p>
 <p>“I am Pang Shitu. Today, I am going to represent the entire Pang Clan to fight with you. If I win, I have no further conditions. And if I lose, I will apologise to you and from today onwards, as long as you are alive, none of our Pang Clan members will set foot on this street.” Pang Shitu stared at Qing Shui as he spoke seriously.</p>
