 <p><strong>AST 1384 - Yehuang Guwu's Motherly Love... Troubles Arise Once Again, The Powerful Che Clan.</strong></p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Yehuang Guwu was stunned as she looked at this exquisite lass in a daze. Even though she was so beautiful, she was unable to speak, ever. Yehuang Guwu felt that the heavens were being too unfair. Even though she was alone without anyone to rely on, why did she still have to be a mute?</p>
 <p>It wasn't that Yehuang Guwu despised her. When she heard what Qing Shui said, what she felt more was pity. She rubbed the lass on the head. When Qing Shui saw Yehuang Guwu's expression, he knew that as long as the lass' birth parents didn't appear, Yehuang Guwu would treat her as her real daughter.</p>
 <p>"Although she doesn't have a Voice Meridian, she is very strong in other aspects. You win some, you lose some. And to be taken by Little Wuwu as your daughter, this is already considered to be a great blessing for her."</p>
 <p>"What ‘my daughter’? In the future, she'll be your daughter as well. You're not allowed to not like her," Yehuang Guwu said angrily.</p>
 <p>"Of course. It's not as if I have never adopted a child before? My eldest child is adopted and is already in her 20s," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu was stunned for a moment before she smiled. Although she was now very close to Qing Shui and knew that he had a number of wives, she didn't know that he had children who weren't his own. She didn't know how many children he had either and only knew that he had children.</p>
 <p>"Oh right, how many children do you have now?" Yehuang Guwu got Qing Shui to sit down on one side while getting the lass to be seated between herself and Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>"Including this, I have 11," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, give this lass a name!" Yehuang Guwu gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"We'll call her Qing Jun!" Qing Shui thought about it and replied.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu smiled, "Alright. This is our daughter. You'll have to give her some gifts!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a set of things that were the same as what he had given his other children. He squatted down before the lass and placed them before her. There were also small bangles and the Longevity Lock which he helped to put on her.</p>
 <p>Qing Jun looked at Qing Shui with big eyes and a happy smile broke out on her exquisite little face.</p>
 <p>At her age, there would be some children who might still retain some faint memories but most children wouldn't be able to remember things that had happened at this age.</p>
 <p>Earlier on, Qing Shui told Yehuang Guwu that one would win some and lose some. Although she lost her ability to speak, she was powerful in other aspects. She had a strong aptitude, powerful memory and a great bone structure.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, can the lass be treated?" Yehuang Guwu looked very happy when she saw Qing Shui bringing out so many things. She was initially afraid that Qing Shui wouldn't like the lass.</p>
 <p>"I don't have the ability to do that now. She was born without a Voice Meridian and it'd be useless even if you were to use a medicinal pill which can revive the dead. Because she was born without it to begin with."</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu was a clever lady and didn't say more. She already knew the answer. If even Qing Shui couldn't treat her condition, then no one would be able to. She had the feeling that this lass had been abandoned.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yehuang Guwu. This lady had been showing too much motherly affection recently... However, he liked to see her kindhearted side. When she was together with the lass, she appeared especially beautiful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had never expected to have so many children, regardless of whether they were of his blood or otherwise. However, Qing Shui could really treat them all the same. It was like how Luan Luan and Yuchang were treated no differently from Qing Shui's own children.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>As time passed, half a month went by. During this period of time, Qing Shui had headed back to the Qing Clan once. Yehuang Guwu had also gone back to the Western Oxhe Continent once. However, both of them only stayed for three days. Yehuang Guwu had missed the lass and returned very quickly while Qing Shui was worried about Yehuang Guwu and Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>During this half a month, Yehuang Guwu and Qing Jun were really like mother and child, staying together all the time regardless if they were living, eating or sleeping. It made it hard for Qing Shui even if he wanted to spend a more intimate time with Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Jun couldn't speak, the frequency of the smile on her face had increased. Qing Shui also started to try to communicate with her through sign language and also taught her words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know of a lot of signs, but he knew of some basic ones. Qing Shui's current train of thoughts were something that couldn't be compared with how he was when he was in his previous life. All the things that he had seen before were all imprinted clearly in his mind. Therefore, Qing Shui could come up with a set of simple signs...</p>
 <p>Although the lass didn't have a Voice Meridian, she could hear. In Qing Shui's previous life, those who were generally born a mute tended to be deaf as well.</p>
 <p>Since she could hear, it was easier to teach her. Sign language was only a tool for communication.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would spend some time with her every day to teach her sign language, learn words, counting...</p>
 <p>Every time Yehuang Guwu saw Qing Shui and the lass learning together happily, she felt extremely happy. Although there were no sounds of laughter, she could see that lass' quiet smile and the lass' exquisite little face was one that could invoke feelings of pity.</p>
 <p>On this day, Qing Shui had only came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for a short while when he heard some commotion outside. He frowned and headed outside.</p>
 <p>"Get him out quickly! Our Old Master's condition can't be delayed! Otherwise, you people won't be able to be held responsible for this!"</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, please produce your Guest Card," a person-in-charge of the Imperial Cuisine Hall said politely.</p>
 <p>"Guest Card? What's that?" the man asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"The Imperial Cuisine Hall isn't open to the public. Only those who have a Guest Card can receive treatment."</p>
 <p>"Then quickly give me a Guest Card!" the man said anxiously.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, the Guest Cards are all given out personally by the Miraculous Physician. I don't have one either."</p>
 <p>"Ahh! I don't care anymore! Call him here! Say that Che Clan is asking him to come over!"</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry. Without a Guest Card, the Miraculous Physician won't meet you. Please return!"</p>
 <p>"Smash this place up! I don't believe that he won't come out then!" the man shouted out loudly.</p>
 <p>"Che Lang! This is the Imperial Cuisine Hall, don't be impudent!" A voice rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was heading outside when he heard this voice and was stunned. It was because that voice was Yelang Qiankun's voice.</p>
 <p>"Yelang Qiankun, you guys may be scared of this kid, but I am not. Why, are you planning to go against our Che Clan?" the man's voice was full of contempt.</p>
 <p>"I promised Miraculous Physician Qing that I'd ensure Imperial Cuisine Hall's safety," Yelang Qiankun said with a struggle.</p>
 <p>"You'll ensure their safety? Do you think that Yelang Clan is able to do it? What a joke. You guys have been beaten up, shamed and yet you're still sticking your face to his butt. Do you feel that you'll be able to become friends like this? Why are you still so childish despite your age? Our Old Master's condition is very serious. Will you be able to take responsibility if anything were to happen?" It's very easy for Che Clan to wipe out your Yelang Clan. If you don't believe, why don't you try us?" Che Lang's voice was extremely cold.</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun knew that Qing Shui was very close with Tianhe Clan, especially Tianhe Renmo. Even now, the Imperial Cuisine Hall was also situated in the Tianhe Clan's manor.</p>
 <p>It was impossible for Yelang Clan and Tianhe Clan to resolve their feuds. With Yelang Qiankun's understanding toward Qing Shui, it was impossible for him to work together with a clan like Yelang Clan. To make it simple, it meant that Qing Shui wouldn't hold the Yelang Clan in high regard.</p>
 <p>It might be a little funny but Yelang Qiankun didn't find this funny at all. It wouldn't take long for this young man to be able to reach a height at which he could look down on a clan like the Yelang Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already reached the second story, but he stopped. He wanted to see Yelang Qiankun's decision. He had also heard of some of the situation in the Che Clan. They were an extremely big clan and in the Dancing Phoenix Continent, they were definitely an extremely powerful existence, one of the top-notch ones. They were more powerful than clans like the Linghu Clan and the Yelang Clan.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui hadn't thought that he would have any connections with the Yelang Clan, if Yelang Qiankun were to step forth toward, Qing Shui guarantee that he would take it on himself to settle this case.</p>
 <p>"Smash this place up! I don't believe that he won't come out." After a while, the arrogant voice rang out once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and headed out. When that voice rang out once again, it meant that Yelang Qiankun had made his choice. Qing Shui wasn't surprised by this decision. For the sake of Yelang Clan, Yelang Qiankun didn't have a choice.</p>
 <p>There was nothing wrong with this decision. If Qing Shui was in his shoes, he would do the same as well and not step forth.</p>
 <p>"Who are you? Scram out of this place! This isn't a place for you to kick up a fuss."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a cold bellow as he walked down. With a wave of his hand, all the people were pushed out. Those who were weaker even ended up spurting blood.</p>
 <p>In Che Clan, Che Lang was only considered to be a profligate son of the side branch. However, as long as he had the Che Clan's name to back him up, then he would bask in glory. Even Yelang Qiankun wouldn't dare to go up against him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked outside casually. They were just a bunch of profligate sons. Although their cultivation levels weren't bad, it depended on who their opponents were. While they appeared extremely powerful when compared with ordinary people, they were like ants before Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"How dare you beat up people from our Che Clan! You can wait to see your entire clan wiped out!"</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lashed out a slap across space, causing Che Lang to lose all of his teeth and blood was flowing out from his mouth, nose and ears. He immediately fell unconscious, his face swelled up to be like that of a pig's.</p>
 <p>"Scram! If I see you guys again, I wouldn't mind taking your lives. Who do you think you are?"</p>
 <p>With that, Qing Shui immediately turned back and headed to the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun, who was in the distance, watched in a daze. Eventually, he sighed and left.</p>
 <p>Many people saw this scene and were in admiration of Qing Shui's way of handling the situation. However, they were also worried for him. Of course, there were some aristocratic clans and wealthy families who were happy to see this. No matter who killed the other, it didn't concern them at all. Many people enjoyed watching a good show.</p>
 <p>The people who came to create trouble left, carrying the unconscious Che Lang.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know why Che Clan had let these arrogant and brainless people come to look for him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really couldn't understand someone like this. However, it was a fact that people like these existed.</p>
 <p>Would it kill them to have a better attitude and not be so arrogant?</p>
 <p>It could be because Che Lang himself had taken the initiative to request Qing Shui to head to Che Clan. It was impossible that everyone from Che Clan was like this. For a big and powerful clan, it was impossible for them to rely on people like these for their development.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that these people set their eyes too high and when they spoke, they were foolishly arrogant. He wondered if people like them were considered to be the same as those who would snatch women and bully the weak. They were all proud "foolish second generations" who thought highly of themselves.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that what he had done could force him into dire straits. However, if they were to come again, he would still do the same.</p>
 <p>Che Clan was also an existence in the Phoenix Dance Organization and held the position of Custodian. The positions that were considered to be the upper echelon in the Phoenix Dance Organization were the Elders, Custodians, Supreme Elders, Left and Right Custodians. There was also the true head of the group and the deputy head.</p>
 <p>There were one Left Custodian and Right Custodian respectively and they held extremely dignified positions. Even the deputy head didn't have the rights over them. For the other positions, there were more clans taking up.</p>
 <p>The Custodians' status was a lot higher than that of the Elders, thus the Che Clan's position was highly respected. They were slightly more powerful than the Dongye Clan, at least on the surface. Therefore, Qing Shui was considered to have gotten himself involved with a powerful force.</p>
