 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a great thing. At the moment, Qing Shui was feeling very comfortable. Even if the Great Confucian Empire was to look for trouble with him, he would no longer be worried about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Certainly, Qing Shui wasn’t being full of himself. It was the saturated state within him which occurred as a result of the sudden and significant rise in his strength. At this very moment, he felt as if he was capable of creating a crater in the sky. This was a sensation which emerged as a result of the sudden surge of his strength and it wasn’t fully controlled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Shui hadn’t fully mastered it yet. It only meant that he couldn’t use it freely and exquisitely. For example, he could use a strength worth one hundred Jin to squeeze an ant and yet the ant wouldn’t die. This was what it meant as controlling and harnessing his strength. Otherwise, Qing Shui would have destroyed whatever he came in contact with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s continue after we get back. I haven’t even eaten yet. Well, it’s time to eat anyway. I will prepare the food today.” Qing Shui smiled and greeted the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you serious about curing the Second Prince Hua?” Qin Qing asked confused on the way back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, “Since you have already mentioned it, let me cure him then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I thought you don’t treat bad people?” Qin Qing was getting more and more confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be it good or bad, they are still humans. Since he exists, there must be a reason for his existence. It is a doctor’s job to cure people that are ill. If you try to look at the bigger picture. The food chain, we humans are a part of it. Though we may be the prey to others, we also tend to feed on them back. Maybe in the past, I have been too narrow-minded, or maybe prior to this, I viewed him as my personal enemy, or not… He seems to not have the qualification for me to view him as that… And that is why I feel alright with curing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked a bit like he was mumbling to himself. Qin Qing didn’t really understand what he was saying, but at the same time, she also felt like she was able to relate to it. She knew that Qing Shui has broadened his horizon even more. Second Prince Hua wasn’t considered as his personal enemy. The only possible scenario was for him to view Qing Shui as his personal enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, let’s stop thinking about this. Everything will be alright. Even if the sky is to drop down, I will also be there to support you. I am slightly taller than you, ain’t I?” Qing Shui smiled as he grabbed her hand and walked forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing smiled, “I have truly failed to understand you today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the future, when we are finally together, I will let you see me thoroughly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing, “......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Imperial Cuisine Hall has finally gotten noisier. At the moment, Yu Niang and Tian Yi were living their life very happily. It was just that the brat from before was still following them. The other three children have all grown into adults and each had their own matters to solve. Though they also stayed behind at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, they have each formed their own family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the brat from back then. At the moment, he has already gotten very big. Nevertheless, he was still just a child. Since then they have already given birth to three additional children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very happy to see them. Yu Niang was much younger than before. After taking the Xiantian Golden Pellets and using some of the Youth Retaining Pellet which Qing Shui gave to her, she barely had any age mark on her face. Back then, at the time when they got married, she wasn’t actually that old. Or rather, she could be considered quite young. She was slightly younger even compared to Tian Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But compared to Qing Shui, she was slightly older.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep down in his heart, Qing Shui hoped that this woman could be happy. He was very delighted to see her finding a place where she could settle down peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a look at the people around him. Without himself noticing, he has already lived for quite a long time around here. It started after encountering each other among such a huge crowd, into knowing so much about her… And now, developing from friends into lovers… There was a mysterious fate hiding behind it. There were no what-ifs scenarios in this. That kind of situation could never be predicted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui didn’t dare to think much about it. He almost made a huge mistake, or rather, whether or not it was a mistake, he also wasn’t sure about it. If the Second Young Master Hua had carried out his massacre here, it would have been a mistake. Qing Shui would have regretted greatly why he didn’t choose to eliminate him here. He might have gone through a complete change in personality instead of the comprehension he learned today. In the end, he might end up as a person who lived to slaughter instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Often times, one would never know about their decision and how could it affect their future. Just like the current Qing Shui. Back then, he chose to spare the Second Young Master Hua. And today, he also decided to cure him, but whether or not it was a right decision, even he himself wasn’t sure about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, as long as a person could get to the point of not regretting anything he did, he would have been considered successful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui settled down in the Imperial Cuisine Hall. This place was very huge. The girls returned to the Sunset Sea King Palace after staying for a few days. Besides, the palace needed someone to look after it. However, Qin Qing and Tantai Lingyan, on the other hand, would still stay for a few more days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they might be members of the Sunset Sea King Palace, they had more freedom than usual, let alone they were as close as siblings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, Second Young Master Hua visited once again. He insisted on coming every day for two months. This was already his fifth day here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was feeling great joy during these few days. He felt very proud and elated throughout these past few days. As of now, he has already taken off his woman clothes and put on his male clothes. This was a beautiful man and now he has also gotten powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Suddenly, I feel that I have undergone great changes throughout these days.” Second Young Master Hua sat down and said after greeting Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After interacting with each other for a few days, the two have started to get familiar with each other. As said, a situation could change a person. Everyone would change, so would the Second Young Master Hua. The Second Young Master Hua was no longer the arrogant and ignorant him in the past. The current Second Young Master Hua was no longer as annoying as he used to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “Why are you suddenly saying things like that? You certainly went through a great change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone must change at a certain point. If a person doesn’t change, they will only be abandoned by the world. If this had been the first time we met, we would very likely have been friends.” Second Young Master Hua said softly, making people unable to discern his current mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Maybe. There aren’t so many ‘what-if’ scenarios throughout one’s life. It’s of utmost importance for a person to grasp every opportunity he can find.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true as well. There will be someone from the Great Confucian Empire looking for you very soon.” Second Young Master Hua changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t feel weird about it at all. It was perfectly normal for the Great Confucian Empire to come and look for him. They wanted him to serve them.</span></p>

It was perfectly normal for things like this to happen. It was not out of the ordinary for a huge force to have ill patients. It was a very frequent problem for warriors to have incurable hidden illnesses. Naturally, if they ever ran into an outstanding doctor, he would be greatly welcomed to treat their illnesses.</span></p>

Before this, he was concerned about the Great Confucian Empire behind his back. But now, he seemed to be less alerted about it. The breakthrough in his strength made him confident about going up against the huge monster in front.</span></p>

Not only so, but he had also infused the formidable strength into every single one of his cells. It was as if he had effortlessly set his own heaven and earth and all of them were clear and in a good order.</span></p>
