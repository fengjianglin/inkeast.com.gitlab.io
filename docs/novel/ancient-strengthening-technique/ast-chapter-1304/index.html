 <p><strong>AST 1304 - The Eldest Princess Exits From Seclusion, Constitution Nurturing</strong></p>
 <p>The woman shook her head after thinking for a while, “I have really not heard about it on the Western Oxhe Continent. It’s likely that they’re not famous around here. Or else, I think I would have known about them. You have been to the Western Oxhe Continent for two years, but you probably haven’t heard about them before either!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, they may be from some first or second grade dynasties!” Qing Shui leisurely shook his head. Despite this, he still felt like looking for it. He would like to at least make the Formation Immortal Sect help him look for it.</p>
 <p>After all, the average forces around the Western Oxhe Continent would become terrifying existences when they arrived on the five continents. However, it was almost impossible for them to go to the five continents and do anything. After all, nothing was more important than surviving. This was a kind of rule. It was believed that they themselves were also aware of their own existences every day. In five years time, Qing Shui made up his mind to travel to the Ancient Teleportation Array. If anyone related to Beitang Clan appeared, Qing Shui wouldn’t hesitate to kill them.</p>
 <p>During this time, it would be best if he could find Beitang Clan. He would also try to look for Buddha Sect at his convenience. Next time, he might bring Little Fattie over and let him lead the Buddha Sect here. Of course, he would still have to at least locate the sect itself first.</p>
 <p>“Do you hold any grudges with them?” The woman asked after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I’m worried that they might head back to the five continents. Hence, I plan to take control of the Ancient Teleportation Array,” Qing Shui said after he thought for a bit.</p>
 <p>“Controlling the Ancient Teleportation Array is something that wouldn’t have been a really hard task for you. Originally, it was already being controlled by some not so powerful sects,” the woman said after a brief moment of thought.</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui had already come to a decision, he chose to head back to Heaven Secrets Academy. In the future, the Ancient Teleportation Array would only be able to teleport people from the five continents to the Western Oxhe Continent. It shouldn’t allow the people from the Western Oxhe Continent to come here.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui has stayed here for about one day and two nights. No matter his intentions, he had left behind quite a few things for the woman, including some of his ingredients. The woman also didn’t show any formality towards him.</p>
 <p>Early in the morning, Qing Shui had already unleashed his Nine Continents Steps and left. During the entire time, he met neither Yu Ruyan nor Tantai Xuan. Both of them had already secluded themselves. As for when they would come out, it was something yet to be confirmed.</p>
 <p>With the Nine Continents Steps, traveling had become something that was extremely convenient. The daily 20 times usage of Nine Continents Steps was equivalent to a month’s travel on the back of a flying beast. Hence, it was still quite easy for Qing Shui to travel back and forth across a continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t head to the Eastern Victory Divine Continent back when he was in the five continents. Going there once would only take him around three days. The distances between the five continents could no longer hinder Qing Shui. The only thing that could stop him was the distance between the three continents and the distance between Western Oxhe Continent and the other five continents. Now that he had the Five Elements Divine Flag, things had become many times easier. Of course, he also had the ability to travel between the husband flag and wife flag. However, the Five Elements Divine Flags could only set one checkpoint, so it wasn’t of much use for Qing Shui right now. At least to him, it wasn’t.</p>
 <p>It seemed as if there was a kind of coincidence for everything. This should be what’s known as matching both the nature as well as reasons at the same time. In other words, something that happened naturally.</p>
 <p>After more than ten days, Qing Shui once again returned to the Heaven Secrets Academy. On his visit this time, the first person who he actually managed to see surprisingly turned out to be the Eldest Princess. He met her on the way and was a bit shocked. It seemed she had exited her seclusion relatively early.</p>
 <p>“You’re back!” The Eldest Princess seemed unusually happy when she saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The aura around the Eldest Princess had changed and her strength had increased. But for now, there was still a huge gap between her and Qing Shui. Despite this, the current strength of the Eldest Princess had already exceeded Fu Yantian’s.</p>
 <p>Like usual, she still looked very beautiful. She wore a plain snow-white gown today. Unconsciously, her charm could cause anyone to fall for her. She had bright eyes and white teeth. She looked like a fairy when she had no make-up on. In comparison to Yiye Jiange, there was an additional flavor on her that made her feel more like she was a mortal. Nonetheless, she possessed a terrifying noble aura.</p>
 <p>Without saying anything, Qing Shui went up to her and hugged her, “When did you exit your seclusion?”</p>
 <p>“Just recently!”</p>
 <p>“I just came back recently too!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess lifted up her head and looked at Qing Shui. She extended her hand and held up Qing Shui’s face. Qing Shui saw that her expression was different from before, her eyes seemed to be saying something.</p>
 <p>“Sunu, what’s wrong? Did anything happen?” Qing Shui asked with a bit of concern.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s just that I really want to see you,” the Eldest Princess said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Don’t mention seeing me, even if you want to play with me, I will allow you to do so.” Qing Shui tried to tease her.</p>
 <p>“Who would want to play with you, you shameless freak!” The Eldest Princess immediately pinched Qing Shui’s face with her hand that held his face and she revealed a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“Where are they?” While walking toward their home, Qing Shui grabbed her hand and asked.</p>
 <p>“They should be at home! Let’s go visit them. Why don’t you let go of my hand,” the Eldest Princess said as she shook her hand.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? It’s not like they don’t know. You are still so embarrassed even though we’re already old husband and wife.” Qing Shui was grabbing her really tightly. It was like he would never let go of her.</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter whether the Seventh Princess liked him or not. He would still be like this. The things between him and the Eldest Princess would never change. At the same time, the Seventh Princess would not try to involve herself in it. This kind of thing was something which couldn’t be forced.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess had her sight fixed on Qing Shui, who was becoming more and more arrogant. She helplessly followed him to the courtyard. Actually, as soon as they went in, they could already see the three girls approaching them at a fairly quick pace.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>Qing Sha rushed toward them happily and immediately clung onto Qing Shui. Qing Shui was about a hundred and eighty five centimeters tall. Qing Sha, on the other hand, was only about a hundred and sixty meters tall. She put her hands around Qing Shui’s neck and smiled while looking at him. But from other people’s perspective, it only looked like a faint smile. Qing Sha had never once let out a loud laugh before. Even the times that she grinned was something which could be counted with fingers.</p>
 <p>However, her smile was very infectious. It was a kind of brilliance that couldn’t be described in words. It looked really clear. Somehow, it looked a bit like a cold smile but at the same time, this also didn’t seem to be the case. The effect was similar to an ice cold beauty showing her smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled while looking at this adopted daughter of his. He liked giving her warmth and would feel particularly happy whenever he saw her smile. He would also find peace in his mind. This should very likely be what was known as fate. It’s the same as when he met Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried her up and only put her back down after spinning her around two rounds. Everyone happily greeted each other and walked toward the living room together.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, when Qing Shui was holding hands with the Eldest Princess as he walked toward here, his sight was constantly fixed on the Seventh Princess. He didn’t see any weird expression from her. On the contrary, it seemed like Yan Jinyu was a bit speechless. However, that reaction disappeared fairly quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what method the Heaven Secrets Academy used to help boost the Eldest Princess’ strength. It was almost four thousand sun now. It was worth as much as 3,800 sun. It seemed like Heaven Secrets Academy still had a few unique things of their own.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you surprised by my strength? This is the Sect Inheritance. It’s somewhat similar to the Grand Sect Defensive Formation. This kind of inheritance can only be used once every five hundred years.” The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui because he had looked at her a number of times. She could tell that he was trying to analyze her strength.</p>
 <p>Great benefits really did come with powerful sects. As long as one was gifted and got recognized by the sect, the sect itself would use a lot of methods to increase their strength. Of course, this was taking into account that the person was born with the talent required. Or else, they too wouldn’t have wanted to waste the once-in-a-lifetime chance which they would only run into in every few hundred years.</p>
 <p>“Yes! This is great!” Even though Qing Shui knew that Headmaster Sui and Headmaster Cao would try their best, he had never expected for them to put in so much effort. He felt really happy.</p>
 <p>“Oh yes, there is a Supreme Ancestor Elder whose lifespan is nearing his end. He is going to infuse strength into me.” The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui again.</p>
 <p>“Strength Infusion……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was reminded of the Joyous Sage. There were two kinds of Strength Infusion. The first kind was the slightly weaker variation of Strength Infusion. It was more like building up a foundation. Last time, the Joyous Sage was precisely like this when he went through Strength Infusion. There was a kind of Strength Infusion that was related to when a person’s lifespan was almost up. Or rather, when a person was no longer able to extend their lifespan and was on the brink of death. It was a Strength Infusion that was similar to transferring his martial techniques to another person.</p>
 <p>This sort of Strength Infusion was very powerful but it also came with huge risks. The reason for this risk was that if the person who was being infused with strength was too weak, they might not be able to withstand it. Additionally, they were also restricted by innate skills and proficiency. Hence, it was impossible for the person to keep on absorbing their strength. Once they reached a saturation point, they would no longer be able to absorb it. The energies left behind within their body would instead end up being harmful to them.</p>
 <p>The Supreme Ancestor Elder which the Eldest Princess mentioned was probably the second kind. Since the Elder’s lifespan was coming to an end, Qing Shui furrowed his brow and said, “This could be dangerous.”</p>
 <p>“I know but I just went through the Sect Inheritance recently. There is a kind of mysterious strength within my body. It will help lower the risk to a minimum. Additionally, my strength is what it is now. Hence, the risk is still fairly small,” the Eldest Princess explained when she saw that Qing Shui was worried.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t say anything. He just kept on staring at the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Yu Sunu became really panicked and was a bit fearful. While she stared at Qing Shui, she tried her best to calm down as she said slowly, “Originally, the Supreme Ancestor Elder was getting ready to help the next head go through Strength Infusion. I hate going through Strength Infusion. I don’t want to let her die just to gain her strength. But the elder has already made up her mind. She feels that her time is almost up and that she would have at most a year to live.”</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess was really eager to get more strength. But actually, he was not any different. It was due to her origin. Qing Shui felt that he has demanded too much from to others. Compared to her desire for more strength, his was even worse.</p>
 <p>“Be more careful. I am going to spend these two days to help your body recuperate and stabilize your strength.” Qing Shui said and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Are you angry?” It was the first time that the Eldest Princess asked something like this a bit nervously.</p>
 <p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
 <p>“Do you feel that I would do anything just to gain strength?” The Eldest Princess didn’t blink even once.</p>
 <p>“Everyone would be very passionate and obsessed with strength. I am just worried that you will mess up your cultivation for it. If your heart is messy, your strength will be unstable. That way, once you become stronger, it will be very easy for you to lose control over yourself. Keep your conscience. Don’t lose yourself inside the whirlpool of pursuing strength,” Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>“I understand, thank you!” the Eldest Princess was stunned and replied sincerely.</p>
 <p>Somehow, Qing Shui knew that the things that he said might have a bit of an effect on her. It was similar to waking up a dreaming person with a speech. However, even he wasn’t sure if it would be as effective as it sounded.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui made the Eldest Princess swallow the upgraded Constitution Nurturing Pill. After that, he tried to help her by doing some acupuncture with his Gold Needles and conveniently triggered its medicinal effect. Somehow, its effects were still quite effective.</p>
 <p>They were in the Eldest Princess’ bedroom. It wasn’t the first time Qing Shui had come here. Despite this, everything was different compared to before. Now, their relationship was already confirmed with each other. They have yet to take the final step.</p>
 <p>As of now, the Eldest Princess was completely naked as she laid on her bed. Even though there were already a lot of Gold Needles in her back, she still looked incomparably seductive. Her snow-white body was giving out a fatal attraction. While inside the bamboo house, he was aroused by her, to the point where his entire body started burning like a flame.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess was leaning on her side. She was looking at Qing Shui with her beautiful eyes. Despite this, she still smiled while looking at Qing Shui, whose breath was already starting to get a bit disordered.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui clenched his teeth while helping her with the acupuncture. Meanwhile, the Eldest Princess happened to see the reaction of Qing Shui’s lower half. That part was sticking out really high.</p>
 <p>After roughly two hours, the Constitution Nurturing was completed. Surprisingly, the results this time were unusually effective. The Consitution Nurturing wouldn’t help to raise one’s strength. Its main goal was only to enhance the person’s foundation. It was similar to when a player in a video game tried to raise their basic attacks. Suppose the attack damage of the Eldest Princess was from 500 to 1500 attack damage. After going through Constitution Nurturing this time, it would raise the former 500 attack damage to 1000 attack damage. On the other hand, the 1500 attack damage would remain at 1500, that does not change.</p>
 <p>This was just a hypothetical situation. It was just like the situation now, this was just to make her body more stable so that it would have an even stronger foundation just like a mountain. The purpose was to let her strength thoroughly merge itself into her meridians and bones. Furthermore, it could help her raise her martial grade.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, why don’t you stay here to accompany me tonight!”</p>
 <p>Right when Qing Shui put away the final Gold Needle, the Eldest Princess’ voice came through.</p>
