 <p><strong>AST 1263 - The State Of Toppling Mountains and Oceans, The Powerful Nine Continents Boots</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if the Nirvanic Fruit was something which would only occur once. However, he didn’t have time to think about this now. Through the window from his room, he could see the brightly lit world outside. The entire Imperial City was bright like daytime and the streams of people down there appeared like a beautiful line of scenery.</p>
 <p>He had a very good eyesight and was able to see the beautiful women below. They all wore gorgeous clothes that revealed the beautiful outlines of their body. There were also a lot of couples holding hands as they strolled along the street. Even when the street might be in a mess, it wasn’t able to stop them from indulging themselves in their own world. Despite how busy the street was, there was still a peaceful and quiet place within their heart which was shared only among themselves.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui missed the old days but time would never return once it passed. He missed how innocent the world once felt. Back then when he used to know nothing, there was a girl who used to be with him. Until now, he was still wasn’t sure if she could be counted as his lover. They once held hands with each other and occasionally, they would kiss each other's cheek. They would spend the majority of their time talking to each other and the girl would tease him. Unfortunately at that time, he was still too innocent. Or rather, he didn’t have the courage to express his desire for sex. However, he now couldn’t think it through no matter how hard he tried. Until now, did he only come to realize that those were all hints. If he had taken a step forward, anything would have happen. As he thought about it now, he also didn’t know how he should feel. He could only blame himself for being too innocent at that time.</p>
 <p>It was nothing but just memories. Switching to now, the present him who was already experienced, even if he wanted to be innocent, wouldn’t be able to do it. He was unable to resist the temptation of the beautiful world. It was just like the wonderful feeling an inexperienced man or woman had upon on their first exposure to such kinds of things. This was something which couldn’t be acted out. After that, on the next time they had this similar kind of sensation, they wouldn’t be able to achieve the full feeling like the first time, even if the person they were doing it with changed.</p>
 <p>This could also be considered as a kind of experience as they had been exposed and as well experienced how it felt to have sex. Of course, it was not that having it now was bad. Humans were all like this. They would only start missing something once they permanently lost it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would unconsciously think of the him in the past when he looked at the shy and intimate behaviour of the young men and women below. Now, the person he thought about the most was Di Chen. He was worried that Di Chen might have forgotten about him</p>
 <p>This idea made Qing Shui felt really concerned. Even though he himself was unable to interpret this thought, it was able to appear clearly in his head. He didn’t want to use the Heartmatched fruit. It was not a matter of whether they’re useful or not, he just felt that once he used it, Di Chen would no longer be like her old-self.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, it was already the second day. Qing Shui immediately entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal once again.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird quietly laid down on the huge Chinese Parasol Tree. Qing Shui was really satisfied with the formidable aura being emitted by it. Upon sensing that he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it let out a cheerful chirp and used its mind to greet him.</p>
 <p>When a demonic beast became powerful, its intellect would also follow along and increase. However, these weren’t important. What Qing Shui found more important was that once it became more intelligent, he would be able to let it go run some errands alone. After all, it already possessed its own unique thoughts.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had also improved at a steady pace, and could be considered quite fast as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui cultivated his Ancient Strengthening Technique. After that, he proceeded to roughly cultivate through the rest of his techniques before he took out the Nine Continents Boots and the Blackmoon Star. Right now, he felt a bit excited as the boots were going to ascend in one grade, furthermore, it was doing so in all fields.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was going to refine the Nine Continents Boots. These were something given to him by Madame Mo but compared to before, its appearance had changed drastically together with its abilities as it improved significantly. If he really managed to ascend it by yet another grade smoothly, it could really be treated as a mini Divine Weapon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only began to fuse it after he was done preparing everything. In any case, while he was here, nothing would really interrupt Qing Shui from doing anything even if the sky was to fall down.</p>
 <p>In terms of hardness and thickness, the Blackmoon Star might just be on the same standard, even above, that of the Yang Stones. If it wasn’t because of Qing Shui’s current strength, which had gone through a significant increase, melting the Blackmoon Star would have really been a problem. Now, everything was fine. Even though it was a bit difficult, it was something which he could still manage.</p>
 <p>On the 64th day, Qing Shui finally melted the Blackmoon Star and slowly dipped the Nine Continents Boots into the solution which resembled the Blackmoon Star itself.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Nine Continents Boots behaved just like a sponge as it absorbed all of the Blackmoon Star liquid in a short while. Despite so, Qing Shui didn’t stop as he constantly heated the Nine Continents Boots with the Primordial Flame.</p>
 <p>The ability of the Nine Continents Boots to resist heat could rival against the Big Dipper Sword. Merely from this phenomenon, Qing Shui could already tell that they were both good stuffs. Just because they could resist high temperature didn’t necessarily mean that they were good stuffs. It was because they were heat-resistant molding objects, for example, weapons, armors, whips and such. As long as it was a heat-resistant object, which only managed to take their shape through heat, they would definitely not be a trash.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out his Spiritual Sense. Just like this, he continued to burn and refine it to let the melted solution of the Blackmoon Star to completely blend itself into the Nine Continents Boots. At the moment when the familiar light appeared, Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>At least for now, the success rate was high. The light lasted for one breathing time and at the moment it faded, Qing Shui happily stopped. Everything went really smoothly. He used the Immortal Stone when he refined it to significantly increase the success rate.</p>
 <p>For now, Qing Shui had a feeling that the Divine Cast Stone should be an equal existence to the Golden Snake Grass as well as Silver Snake Grass. After all, it felt a bit like a dream to have 100% success rate. Certainly, things like these would exist, it’s just that they would come in very small quantity. Even Qing Shui was uncertain about it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wiped away all other thoughts in his mind as he looked at the current Nine Continents Boots. He quickly peeked at it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Boots!</p>
 <p>It was made of both the Astral Fragments of the World of the Nine Continents and the Nine Continents Fantastic Beasts. It had extremely mysterious ability.</p>
 <p>Speed went up by four folds. Consumption reduced by four folds. Even someone with the strength of Martial Emperor would find it difficult to cause the slightest damage to it. Additional battle technique: Nine Continents Steps Effect.</p>
 <p>In the past, it used to only increase speed and reduce consumption by three folds. Now, they had both turned to four folds!</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps Effect: Operate the Nine Continents Boots to trigger the Nine Continents Steps Effect. Instantly allow the wearer to travel 2 million li in a straight line. It is currently at Grade Five. The State of Toppling Mountains and Oceans. Can be used 20 times per day.</p>
 <p>It could carry along every living thing 100 meters within it. This includes humans, demonic beasts and so on.</p>
 <p>Condition of use: Martial Emperor grade.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui was unable to express his joy as his speed had increased. Do not look down on a one fold increase. It could also be considered as a kind of significant improvement to have his speed multiplied from the original three folds to the current four folds. Speed was the most terrifying thing. Out of everything across the world, only speed was unbeatable. Once someone achieved a certain speed, there would be nothing which they wouldn’t be able to defeat.</p>
 <p>His speed had increased, yet the amount of energy he needed to consume was reduced. Now, Qing Shui would be able to travel over land and water. Merely with his physical body alone, he would already be able to withstand the energy consumption for a long period of time. However, this was still not what Qing Shui felt the happiest about. The thing which made him the most delighted was the Nine Continents Steps Effect.</p>
 <p>It might have ascended up a grade, but the amount of the distance that had been increased was different from before. Qing Shui thought that the distance would increase by one fold from the distance prior to the ascension. However, he now realized that he was wrong. The amount of distance increased was way more than what he expected previously.</p>
 <p>It would be able to travel up to 2 million Lis at one go and Qing Shui would be able to use it for up to 20 times every day. That would mean 40 million Lis. As of now, it had become way too easy for him to travel back to the Heaven Secrets Academy from the Divine Might Dynasty. Also, he now felt a bit confident in travelling to the other three continents.</p>
 <p>The formidable Nine Continents Boots was extremely important. Even though it had a huge part to do with time, on certain occasions, time itself was a vague concept. Just like the Nine Continents Boots, if it weren’t for the Blackmoon Star, it might have needed around ten or even hundred years for it to ascend up to this grade. Hence, things weren’t as easy as he thought in the sense that they would just ascend up to a new grade by following time. There were no free meals in the world.</p>
 <p>This time, the Blackmoon Star was considered the thing which Qing Shui found the most worth it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put on the Nine Continents Boots. As he did so, an unusual energy transferred into his body. It felt just like when a person was standing on a trampoline. He knew that this was because of his increase in speed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried to adapt to the sudden increase in speed within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Speed was a pleasurable sensation. It was just like some of the sports he was introduced to in his previous incarnation, they were all actually a kind of high speed activity.</p>
 <p>Seeing as time was almost up, Qing Shui left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Just like this, Qing Shui would waste the time which he could use to cultivate and refine his treasures. Hence, he was still a bit upset about it. But it was still considered ok as situations like this wouldn’t happen more than twice in a month. In fact, each time it appeared, it would appear with huge benefits. Somehow, Qing Shui should feel happy being able to encounter this kind of situation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui ate some food cooked by the inn although it tasted average. Eating some food was a habit of his. For someone at his grade, it would be fine even if he didn’t eat anything for ten days as he could take in the spiritual qi in the air to fill up the needs of his body. Actually, eating food was a kind of enjoyment and powerful warriors in particular, would often eat delicious food. To them, it was more towards tasting the food itself, just like how they needed women.</p>
 <p>After having his meal and resting for a while, Qing Shui stood up and left the Imperial City Inn as he head towards the Imperial City Blacksmith Store. The time now was a bit earlier than the promised time but at the moment when Qing Shui had arrived, he could already see Fu Rong.</p>
 <p>“So early! I’m not late, am I?” Qing Shui smiled as he approached her.</p>
 <p>“No, I am the one who came early.” Fu Rong smiled and responded</p>
 <p>“These are the Swift Agile Pills I refined. I have finally succeeded in refining them.” Qing Shui took out eight bottles.</p>
 <p>“So many of them?”</p>
 <p>“There is one pill in every bottle.” Qing Shui was scared that she might get the wrong idea.</p>
 <p>“I know. For these medicinal pills, they’re contained one per bottle. Eight of them are already beyond my imagination.” Fu Rong said joyfully while she opened the bottles.</p>
 <p>“This is great! You’re indeed a powerful alchemist. Well then, give me four of them. We will have four each, how’s that?” Fu Rong looked at Qing Shui and said, a bit embarrass.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui saw this kind of situation, he got cheered up. It seemed that this little brat was still quite contented. He smiled and responded: “Just give me two of them. I also really like the Swift Agile Pill.”</p>
 <p>“No, you need to have at least four of them. We will split 50 - 50. I have already taken great advantage of you.” Fu Rong stood firmly on her ground.</p>
 <p>In the end, Qing Shui asked for three pills while he gave the other five to Fu Rong. She invited him over to her house only to be rejected by Qing Shui. For now, he still didn’t want to be too close to the Royal Clan in the Divine Might Dynasty.</p>
 <p>However, he was aware that eventually, he would to form a closer connection with them. That was because he was afraid that he might drag the Hu Clan and the Diwu Clan down with him. Hence, before Qing Shui left, he gave Fu Rong a Violet Gold Bloodline Pill. This could also be considered as a way of forming good relations. This way, it wouldn’t cause any suspicions from people within the Royal Clan.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui had over thought stuffs. The three most powerful forces within the Western Oxhe Continent still shared a fairly decent relation with each other. In fact, they were pretty close with each other. Occasionally, they would work together to resist against the other half of the beast tide in the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui still felt that it would be better if he did things more cautiously. Right now, he was really confident with himself.</p>
 <p>The ascension of the Nine Continents Steps Effect had made it even easier for him to shuttle back and forth between places. Originally, he planned to return to the area near the Hu Clan but now, he felt that he could delay it a few days later and stroll around the internal part of the Imperial City for a while.</p>
 <p>Because he ran into a fateful encounter in the Imperial City Blacksmith Store, He unconsciously had started to take a bit of liking to the Royal Clan in the Divine Might Dynasty. Besides, he had already taken quite a lot of advantage from it.</p>
