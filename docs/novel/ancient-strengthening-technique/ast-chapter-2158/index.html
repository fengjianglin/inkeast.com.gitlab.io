That old Battle God isn't a fool and would soon know about the details of the situation. After all, that woman is a Demon King Inheritor but isn't one of us." Mo Shi nodded and said.</span></p>

We'll just say that the Junior Sect Master had been injured by someone from the Demon Gate. After all, who would know what the truth is? Moreover, after spreading the news that the woman is a Demon King Inheritor, the Divine Palace would lose a lot of protection from other forces in the Northern Emperor Domain. Their reputation would be ruined, and they won't feel good about this either. They might even attract the hatred of many unknown forces."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hahaha, good. This idea is good. We'll go with what Mo Shi suggests." Mo Situ said happily.</span></p>

She had already washed up and changed into a new set of clothes. Although she had changed her clothes earlier, she had come twice after all; thus, she still needed to wash up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw Qing Shui, she unconsciously blushed a little. At the thought of what this man had done to her earlier, she could not help but turn red, and her heartbeat became faster. Thinking of how he had buried his face into her chest; in the past, she would never have thought that there'd be one day when she would allow a man to...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui carried her and spun one round. "Come, let's go and grab some food."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm!" Tantai Lingyan had a faint and indescribable feeling. She had no idea if this was love, but there was a spot in her heart for him now. This was the only thing that was sustaining her in this world. In the past, it was her feelings of vengeance, and although that still remained now, he seemed to have taken some of the spots in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, she had also thought of what she would do after exacting her vengeance. By then, there would be no hatred in her heart, and she won't have anything else either. She would become the loneliest person in this world. She wondered how she would continue living on like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many times, this would be how humans were. They would live for vengeance and once that's over, the person would become incapacitated. They would then realize that they suddenly lost the desire to live on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one could quickly find some other hope: for example, to find a man they love, form a family and have their own children, make good friends, or find things that they enjoyed doing, many of them could change rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, let's call Nuo Lan along to join us." Tantai Lingyan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hesitated a little before saying, "Alright!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went to knock on Nuo Lan's door, "Nuo Lan, come and join us for some food."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Will I be bothering you guys from your intimate time together?" Nuo Lan jokingly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You won't. Come on!" Qing Shui assured her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lingyan, you've become even more beautiful." Nuo Lan commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no such thing." Tantai Lingyan smiled and said a little awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh, I understand. It must have been the nourishment from Qing Shui!" Nuo Lan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. This demoness would never be hesitant in her words, and Tantai Lingyan blushed immediately. Although she didn't really make love with Qing Shui, what they did was almost the same. She was a woman with a pure heart and few desires, but she wasn't a heartless woman and also had desires like what ordinary people had. It was just that her desires were weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sister Nuo Lan, can you be a little more reserved in your words?" Qing Shui quickly said when he saw that Tantai Lingyan was feeling a little embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, I won't go on. Otherwise, our Lingyan will run away!" Nuo Lan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're husband and wife, so it's normal for us to do some things. It's been very long since we've met, and I miss her a lot." Qing Shui took Tantai Lingyan's hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, alright, don't be like this. This sister here will feel very lonely for being alone." Nuo Lan tried to laugh it off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, Nuo Lan went to look for Qing Shui, "The Palace Lord is looking for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. He nodded and then headed to the Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Golden Battle God was still very happy to see Qing Shui. He smiled and got Qing Shui to enter the courtyard in his palace and made a pot of tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, do you know the reason why I'm looking for you today?" the old man smiled amiably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Old Master, I really don't know." Qing Shui said honestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui came, he didn't ask Nuo Lan anything. Based on Nuo Lan's intelligence network, he felt that she should know what was up, but he didn't ask. He knew that he would find out very soon after coming here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Demon Gate spread out some news that says you're having a relationship with a woman from the Demon Gate. Actually, they say that your wife is a member of the Demon Gate." The old Golden Battle God said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old Golden Battle God didn't say anything else about Qing Shui colluding with the Demon Gate and he could still smile. Of course, he could tell what was the truth and what wasn't, so he was still very relaxed when saying this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Old Master, this is really the truth. She is my wife and is also a Demon King Inheritor. However, she isn't a member of the Demon Gate, and the Demon King's Blood in her is already gone." Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, although you haven't joined the Divine Palace for long, I still trust that I have good judgment. Therefore, I believe in you. I just want to tell you today not to be concerned with other people's opinions." The old Golden Battle God said slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew what the old man's intentions were. After all, this was the Divine Palace, and they could ignore what outsiders say. However, with so many people in the Divine Palace, there would naturally be people who would blabber. There was a saying that one wasn't afraid of being laughed at by enemies, but instead, by the people on their own side. The old man was worried that Qing Shui would be unable to take the gossips from his allies.</span></p>

The few of them knew about this matter and upon seeing Qing Shui, Diamond scratched his head and asked, "Qing Shui, is your wife really a member of the Demon Gate?"</span></p>

Even if a few of them were to doubt or ridicule Qing Shui, he wouldn't be angered. This was how their characters were and thus he smiled, "That's right. Does Brother Diamond also suspect that I'm colluding with the Demon Gate?"</span></p>

The Demon King's Blood in her body had already disappeared, and we've already been husband and wife for several decades. She isn't a member of the Demon Gate."</span></p>

After all, Qing Shui's wife was a woman whose beauty could bring the downfall of a country and its citizens; moreover, she had the Demon King's Blood flowing in her.&nbsp;</span></p>
