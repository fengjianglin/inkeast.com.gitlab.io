 <p><strong>AST 1399 - I’m Your Woman, Returning Home with Yuan Su, Preparing to Move, Plans</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect such a huge reaction from Yuan Su. After thinking for a moment, he could also understand the feeling of missing home after being so far from home. Ever since he was away, he was never out of touch with such emotion, particularly when he was on his way home. He wished so badly that he could arrive at his destination in just a heartbeat.</p>
 <p>Seeing her withered lovely face, Qing Shui reached out to wipe her tears away. When he was only halfway through wiping her tears, Yuan Su suddenly threw herself into his arms and broke into soft sobs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shi only gently patted her on her lovely back without a word. She had kept her emotions suppressed for too long, it was good that she was letting it all out so rather than consoling her, he just let her vent out all her feelings.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su didn’t lift her head for a long while. Her eyes were red and puffy, but she seemed to be a lot better. She was hugging Qing Shui and with a slightly embarrassed voice, asked him, “Do I look very ugly right now?”</p>
 <p>“Not at all. But instead, I think you look quite cute right now. Little lasses with runny nose are all very adorable and gorgeous,” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have a runny nose! I’m not a little lass either, I’m older than you!” Yuan Su seethed.</p>
 <p>Despite her words, she felt strangely warm in her heart. It was a strange feeling. The man standing before her had a very special place in her heart. He had been there since very long ago and she had complete trust in him.</p>
 <p>When a woman had complete trust in a man, that itself was a problem.</p>
 <p>“Are you feeling better?” Qing Shui asked with a smile. The front of his clothes were already soaked with tears.</p>
 <p>Her tear stained face was tinted red. For a woman who could cry in the arms of a man that was neither a family member nor a lover, even if they were friends, they weren’t any ordinary friends.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine. I must have looked like a joke to you.” Yuan Su calmed down but she didn’t leave Qing Shui’s arms.</p>
 <p>“You must be feeling very comfortable in my arms!” Qing Shui gazed at Yuan Su with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Your women are not around you anyway. It’s not like you’re gonna lose a piece of flesh if I stay like this for a little longer.” Yuan Su shot him a glare.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was taken aback. He didn’t expect Yuan Su to say something so bold. He reached out and embraced her. When a woman held you, then it actually meant a lot of things. The feelings between them were actually a little complicated already. So Qing Shui stopped overthinking. Since they had opened up to each other, they should be acting more natural around each other and there was no need to pretend.</p>
 <p>The body in his arms was soft and delicate. The faint fragrance on her body was really comforting. Yuan Su quietly leaned her head against Qing Shui’s shoulder and was staring at Qing Shui’s enchantingly handsome face from the side. She was a little lost in the mysterious charm that this man had.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su slightly lifted her head and planted a kiss on Qing Shui’s cheek.</p>
 <p>That shocked Qing Shui. The softness he felt on his cheek hadn’t disappeared yet. He looked at the gorgeous lady whose face was as red as the setting sun. Qing Shui could clearly feel every beat of her racing heart.</p>
 <p>She had lowered her head, unable to look Qing Shui in his eyes. Qing Shui was quite amused. A woman like her blushing with shame was a very alluring sight. The impact it had on one’s soul was particularly intense.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Yuan Su had actually put great determination into her actions. He lowered his head lightly to press his forehead against her and lifted her lovely head. The proximity between them was close enough that Qing Shui’s nose could touch her straight and jade-like nose.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su’s fluttering long lashes could almost tickle Qing Shui’s eyes. She was very nervous, seemingly wanting to shut her eyes but also at the same time wishing to keep them open.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly leaned forward to kiss her on her soft and sweet lips, that felt like the petal of a flower. He sucked on her lips gently with a very slow motion.</p>
 <p>The moment Qing Shui’s lips made contact with hers, Yuan Su couldn’t help but to shiver and shut her eyes tightly. Her hands seemed to be ready to push Qing Shui away but turned into an embrace instead when they were halfway into the kiss. It really showed just how flustered she was deep down in her heart.</p>
 <p>The hands which Qing Shui caressed Yuan Su’s hands with slowly slid downwards. The moment they reached her round and gorgeous rear, Yuan Su’s lips suddenly parted, allowing Qing Shui’s tongue to immediately invade the sweet cavern.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t release those slightly swelling soft lips until Yuan Su was breathless from the kiss. Yuan Su shied away a little immediately, not daring to make any eye contact with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Was that satisfying?” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“HMPH!” Yuan Su slapped Qing Shui with a huff.</p>
 <p>“You’re pretty worked up today. Is it because you have already made up your mind to take on me as a responsibility?” Qing Shui continued teasing her.</p>
 <p>“That’s enough Qing Shui. Didn’t you say to let nature take its course? I like you but I still have some indescribable feelings. Can we wait a little longer? If I am going to marry in my life, it will definitely be you.”</p>
 <p>Yuan Su’s words were very complex. All this time, she had repeatedly told herself that she should be the only woman to her man. Yet this man had more than a woman, was she going to throw herself to him like a moth drawn to a fire?</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will never force you. I’ll listen to whatever you say,” Qing Shui assured her with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Are you angry?” Yuan Su looked at him and asked cautiously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s immediately slapped her perky rear with his hand that had never left.</p>
 <p>SLAP!</p>
 <p>The noise that rang out sounded a little obscene. Yuan Su’s face instantly reddened and her lovely body quivered violently. The soft moan that she let out was indescribably sexy.</p>
 <p>It turned out that her sensitive spot was here and it needed a greater stimulation.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, I need to pay home a visit today,” Qing Shui informed her softly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, take care on your journey,” Yuan Su responded softly.</p>
 <p>“Would you like to come along?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was taken aback and stared at Qing Shui in confusion. She didn’t quite understand what Qing Shui was trying to say.</p>
 <p>“I have a way to bring you back along with me. Do you want to come along?” Qing Shui asked her again.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su looked at Qing Shui in shock. “Really? Can I really come along?”</p>
 <p>“Sure you can. Not only that, if you wish to, I can bring you home in just two hours.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“I wish to return! I’ve been waiting for this day!” Yuan Su looked at Qing Shui with anticipation in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Well then, Let’s go inform Sister Wu first before we leave.”</p>
 <p>“Is Sister Wu going too?”</p>
 <p>“I can only bring one person with me.” Qing Shui answered a little speechlessly. The Imperial Cuisine Hall was going to be closed for a few days anyway.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and Yuan Su emerged in the five continents, they found themselves at the Central Continent. Yuan Su looked around in amazement and disbelief. She was holding Qing Shui hands like an indescribably delighted little girl.</p>
 <p>Seven Stars Country</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped at the border of Seven Stars Country then summoned Hellfire Phoenix.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, go home on it. If you wish to find me, get on it and it will find its way back to me. My home is also currently in Central Continent, in the Fair Wind City. Five days… If you are still going to Dancing Phoenix Continent, come find me in five days,” Qing Shui said after thinking for a moment.</p>
 <p>“Are you still blaming me? You refuse to step foot into Seven Stars Country because you are still mad at me?” A look of frustration flashed across Yuan Su’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“No. Am I that petty? Alright, off you go!” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“What does it take for you to forgive me? I’m already in this state. Can’t you be a bigger man this one time?” Yuan Su hugged Qing Shui on her own accord and planted a kiss on his lips.</p>
 <p>“Silly lass. I’m not a petty man. As long as it’s not any heinous matter, I will not hold any grudges. My woman, you don’t need to act like this. I like imposing and overbearing women.” Qing Shui laughed and pinched her jade-like nose.</p>
 <p>“Well then, you promised! Don’t be angry. Wait for me, I will definitely find you. I’m your woman!” Yuan Su immediately left on Hellfire Phoenix after finishing her sentence.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui activated the Nine Continents Steps then rushed in the direction of the Qing Residence. In just a short period of time, he had already arrived at the entrance of his residence.</p>
 <p>His homecomings were always during a festive event. Naturally, an exchange of pleasantries always followed after the greeting. His children were growing older. Qing Zun, Qing Yin and Qing Ming had already grown into teenagers. Their heights were a little more than 1.5 meters, and their appearances could be considered young men.</p>
 <p>Qing Yin was also very tall and possessed a temperament that was particularly similar to Canghai Mingyue, even bearing a slight resemblance to her.</p>
 <p>There was still no news of Yiye Jiange. Although Qing Shui should’ve guessed it, he still missed her a little. He didn’t know where to start looking for her at this point in time.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan was in seclusion, which was quite a surprise. Qing Shui had initially planned to pass the Divine Beast Possession technique to her. Little was needed to be said about the might of Divine Beast Possession technique but the prerequisites were particularly high. It seemed to be specially prepared for users with Heart of Demonic Beast and Heart of Seven Orifices constitutions.</p>
 <p>Since she was in seclusion, then he’d have to leave it to next time and it wasn’t urgent anyway. He had brought Yuan Su here this time. Otherwise, he could bring someone to the Dancing Phoenix Continent.</p>
 <p>With the two old men joining in, Qing Shui could say that they were already well-established in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Therefore, he planned to move the clan over there. After all, it was more suitable for cultivation there.</p>
 <p>The huge living room was very lively with everyone gathered in it. When Qing Shui spoke his thoughts, everyone turned silent. Even the third generations had a smile on their faces. Qing Luo and the rest seemed to be deep in thought.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the Dancing Phoenix Continent is different from here. There are too many powerful cultivators there. We aren’t even capable enough to defend ourselves if we move there. This will create big trouble for you. Not only that, most people in our clan are unable to progress very far in the path of martial arts. Alright, let’s put it this way: whoever wishes to go over there, may do so. Those who don’t wish to go may stay back. I’ve grown familiar with this place and also gotten used to it. There are still some others here. I think I will stay here. I don’t mind going over there when the time is right. What do you think?” Qing Luo pondered for a moment and told Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought for a moment. “That’s fine too, we’ll begin next month then. I can only bring a person over every month, so we’ll be taking our time moving.”</p>
 <p>The third generation of the Qing Clan were elated, especially Qing You, Qing Bei and a few others.</p>
 <p>There was another main problem. When he returned this month, he’d have to look for a huge manor. It had to be located not too far from the Imperial Cuisine Hall. If not, he’d have to make it work in the Imperial Cuisine Hall. It had only taken up one building anyway and there were still another nine buildings which were probably sufficient. With two other powerful cultivators around, nothing bad would happen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a little relaxed after having a clear plan in his mind.</p>
 <p>He needed to leave. So naturally, he had to find them some support they could count on. He had offended a good deal of people in the Dancing Phoenix Continent so he had highlighted the risks to them in advance in hopes of arousing their fighting spirit.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the fifth day, Yuan Su arrived. None were too surprised when they saw how gorgeous she looked. One of them, Di Qing, actually knew her. They could actually be considered very close friends with each other. Yuan Su was surprised when she saw Di Qing holding a child in her arms.</p>
 <p>“The little lass is really beautiful, what’s her name? Di Qing, it’s been a long time since we last met too.”</p>
 <p>Yuan Su took Qing Nuo in her arms. The two ladies were especially happy to meet each other again. Qing Shui wasn’t sure of what had happened when Yuan Su returned home but he could tell that things went pretty well for her from the look on her face. She seemed to be a lot better now.</p>
