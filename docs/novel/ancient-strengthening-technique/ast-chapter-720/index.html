 <p><strong>AST 720 - Leaving everyone and returning to Greencloud Continent</strong></p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui did not blame Yuan Su and could also empathize about her troubles, he still felt slightly uncomfortable. However, after thinking about the benefits that Yuan Su had brought to him that were immeasurable, his heart felt at at ease and relieved.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had originally thought of leaving some items behind for her, however there was really no need for that. Since doing so would increase her distress, Qing Shui chose to leave without a single trace of hesitation.</p>
 <p>He already treated Yuan Su as an honored person along his life journey. Perhaps he was also an honored person in her life, however both of them were passing travelers in each of their lives.</p>
 <p>Since she had made this choice, Qing Shui felt that this might be the best conclusion to this matter.</p>
 <p>Looking at the disappearing figure of Qing Shui, Yuan Su’s heart had become disordered for a moment. Thinking about the imminent takeover of the Medicinal Pill Sect, a wave of jitters rocked through her heart, before shaking her head and riding her yellow bird back to the Medicinal Pill Sect.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not return to the Di Family and instead rushed towards Central Plains. Before he left, he had to send his greetings to Lady Duanmu,</p>
 <p>端木城！</p>
 <p>Duanmu City!</p>
 <p>Qing Mu rode on his Fire Bird. As of now the speed of the Fire Bird was much faster than before. Coupled with the Nine Continents Steps, it took him much less time to reach Duanmu City.</p>
 <p>On the second day he had already arrived at Duanmu City. With the Fire Bird having a fold increase in speed, coupled with the Nine Continents Steps, the distance between regions was akin to crossing doors for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Upon arriving on the door of the Duanmu Family House, it just so happened that Duanmu Lingshang was leaving the house. Looking at her, he felt slightly awkward.</p>
 <p>Previously, during the period of time at the Flower Fruit Mountain, he had teased this frosty and icy lady.</p>
 <p>“ Young Lady Duanmu!” greeted Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Why are you here?” exclaimed Duanmu Lingshuang as she looked at Qing Shui in surprise. Due to her azure dress coupled with her icy cold expression, even the words she said made people feel a chill in their bones.</p>
 <p>“Are you going out?” Qing Shui did not reply to the question of why he was here.Taking a look he asked Duanmu Lingshang who was seemingly going out.</p>
 <p>“I originally planned on going out. Since you have come over, let’s go. Mother’s in the house.” said Duanmu Lingshang who felt slightly awkward. However she felt that it would be even weirder if she had not said it.</p>
 <p>In actual fact Duanmu Lingshang did not think about the matter between Qing Shui and her mother. Even if it was told to her she would not believe it. To her, her mother was the most pure and holy woman and would absolutely never do such a thing. Therefore, she still acted like before.</p>
 <p>“You’re here!”</p>
 <p>If one was to pay close attention, one would be able to discover the change in Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan. It was a kind of indescribable flavor that felt slightly surprising and awkward for her when she saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew and understood this, as after all she was different from Yuan Su. They had truly gone all the way and have done the most intimate of things. Furthermore, she had felt that even she was unable to endure it.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I’ve come today to inform Madame and young lady that I’m returning to the Greencloud Continent.” said Qing Shui softly after the three of them took a seat.</p>
 <p>“Yes, you should go back. When are you preparing to head back?” asked Yu Ruyan with a faint smile as before without any change of her former expression.</p>
 <p>“After preparing I’ll head back in a couple of days. When I’m leaving I won’t come and say my goodbyes to madame again.” replied Qing Shui as he looked at Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“Okay, please take care on your way back and be careful.”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan did not know what to say to Qing Shui while Duanmu Lingshang maintained her silence. Occasionally saying a word or two, her loneliness gave people a feeling of being very natural.</p>
 <p>Taking out two sets of fur coats, bracelets and necklaces like the ones that he had given to Hai Dongqing, he gave one set each to Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang before saying: “ I’m going to head back. Here’s some gifts for you two. If there’s anything you need remember to find me.”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan nodded her head, and pretended to be calm receiving the presents from Qing Shui while replying to him.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang seemed very happy and gave a rare smile towards Qing Shui. She had seemingly no friends of the opposite sex and had very little contact with other people. However she had a quite a lot of interactions with Qing Shui. In her memories, Qing Shui was considered as the most familiar friend from the opposite sex.</p>
 <p>In a previous encounter when Qing Shui had met up with Yu Ruyan, they had chatted about a lot of things unrestrictedly. However this could only be considered as being one another’s best friend and the probability of progressing to the next level was not high.</p>
 <p>After stopping for a short while Qing Shui had to leave. Although Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang tried to urge him to stay, Qing Shui still wanted to leave. After all, it was inappropriate to stay longer due to that matter, after leaving this time, perhaps it might be forgotten in a few years.</p>
 <p>Continuing on his journey back, he wanted to say his goodbyes the Nian Feng grandfather and grandson. He had also wanted to say his farewells to Lan Tong and the rest. All of this was arranged by Qing Shui very quickly, with Qing Shui allowing them to remain in the Jade Sea Country and if anything happens they can find the Nian Feng Family. Qing Shui allowed them to visit the Nian Feng grandfather and grandson once while arranging for Lan Tong and the rest to gift them with seafood after dining in the Nian Feng restaurant.</p>
 <p>It was a kind of fate to meet by chance and if he could extend a helping hand he would. This was a principle of Qing Shui and he would not request any repayment. This was due to Qing Shui discovering that he had received the help of many people and furthermore it was always from people who he had never met before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not head to the Qianyu Family and was prepared to head there only on this return trip, therefore he had only spent four days to reach the Di Family once again.</p>
 <p>“You’ve finished handling everything?” being drawn by Qing Shui to sit on the sofa after enter the room, Di Chen gave a faint smile before asking Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>The relationship between Qing Shui and Di Chen had surged up many levels and it was possible for him to do more intimate actions with her. Other than the previous occasion where he had rascally rubbed Di Chen’s breasts, he did not have a second opportunity yet.</p>
 <p>However Qing Shui did not wish to break the last level with her as Di Chen was seemingly very afraid of it. At most she would allow Qing Shui to kiss her, however she did not allow him to break the last barrier with her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui respected and loved her dearly and therefore did not make any strong requests of her. The feeling of conditions between the both of them was perhaps not there yet.</p>
 <p>When this happened, Di Chen would automatically hug Qing Shui and ask him to give her slightly more time. Only she knew that this was due to her training technique, which would not be good for her to lose her virginity at such a level...</p>
 <p>On the second day, Qing Shui and Di Chen said their goodbyes to the Di Family people before setting foot on the return path to Greencloud Continent. Di Qing did not leave the Di Family, however during their parting she mentioned that she would come find Di Chen after a period of time.</p>
 <p>Giving a smile, Di Chen nodded her head and did not continue to talk about this, as she knew that it was best to let nature take its course.</p>
 <p>In two days, they arrived at the Qianyu Family. Qianyu Dingjun, Qianyu He, Qianyu Qingqing, Qianyu Feifei and the rest gave them a warm welcome. For the Qianyu Family, Nian Family as well as Madame Duanmu, Qing Shui had treated them as friends from his heart. Due to their participation in the previous matter, it was enough to justify that.</p>
 <p>Qianyu Feifei seemingly had a special feeling for Qing Shui which was akin to that of a father. Her life was given to her by Qing Shui, which made her trust in him no less than to her father, which was the person that she worshipped the most. Now there was another, Qing Shui, and she had even regarded him as an elder brother, the kind that was akin to a father.</p>
 <p>He left a few small presents for Qianyu Feifei, which was the Five Elements Fruits, causing her clear and melodious laughter to be transmitted for quite long distance. Upon seeing this, the people in the surroundings were very envious, however this kind of thing was unable to be mass produced. Furthermore, the Five Elements of every person were different.</p>
 <p>Not long after leaving the Qingyu Family, Qing Shui arrived at the ten million kilometre wide wasteland. This time however it was a relaxed matter for him as the speed of the Fire Bird was more than double its previous speed. Coupled with the Nine Continent Steps, his speed had directly risen to approximately three fold as compared to before. In the past he would require hundred days to cross it, however now he was able to accomplish that under fourteen days.</p>
 <p>“Chen Er, come over here and let your husband give you a hug!” exclaimed Qing Shui with his arms spread open and a smile on his face as he stood on the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>“Alright, stop it Qing Shui.” said Di Chen as she shot an annoyed look at Qing Shui</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and walked over while replying, “ If you don’t listen next time, I’ll have to treat you with the family rules?”</p>
 <p>“Family rules? What family rules?” asked Di Chen. Hearing his words, she felt very happy, as she thought about them being already considered as a family.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>“This is family rules!”exclaimed Qing Shui has he gave a extremely gentle pat on Di Chen’s beautiful butt. The sensation that he had felt once again gave him a shock within his spirit.</p>
 <p>“You hoodlum, you’re not allowed to bully me.” snorted Di Chen with rage as she was drawn into Qing Shui’s embrace. The previous pat was extremely soft and gentle, therefore she had only acted like that.</p>
 <p>“How could I bear to do that.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled while sending the Fire Bird back.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you are not considering that we fly there ourselves?”</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>Embracing Di Chen, Qing Shui displayed the Nine Continents Steps, causing them to fly forward ten million kilometres. Whenever he used it, it made Qing Shui’s heart feel particularly satisfied.</p>
 <p>Nine Continent Shoes, refined from the shards of the stars of the World of the Nine Continents and the Nine Continents Mysterious Beast, had unfathomable powers. It was able to double one’s speed while decreasing energy consumption by half. It was unable to be damaged by attacks below Martial Emperor and it had an auxiliary combat technique, Nine Continent Steps.</p>
 <p>Nine Continent Steps: Activate the Nine Continent Shoes and display the Nine Continent Steps. One would instantly be able to reach a distance of ten million kilometers in a straight line. Primary ability as of now, able to be activated once a day.</p>
 <p>Usage criteria: Martial Saint Grade!</p>
 <p>After acquiring the Nine Continent Shoes from Old Madame Mo, Qing Shui had basically worn them all along. Although it was somewhat far from a False God tier weapon, due to its ability to increase speed he considered it not bad, with the primary reason being the Nine Continent Steps.</p>
 <p>At the instant of leaving, Qing Shui revolved his power to the peak and embraced Di Chen tightly in his bosom although there would not be anything happening as a barrier would automatically be formed when he used the Nine Continent Steps. This barrier was for the purpose of protecting the user, and was large enough to accommodate three people</p>
 <p>After he came to a stop, Qing Shui immediately summoned the Fire Bird and continued forward.</p>
 <p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Qing Shui hugged the beautiful woman and laid down on the back of the Fire Bird, while Di Chen leaned on his body. Recently she had discovered that Qing Shui seemingly loved to adhere to herself and would try all means to hug her.</p>
 <p>In the past she would never have imagined that Qing Shui would be able to act like that. Slightly like a hoodlum, slightly bad, however she felt that it was much better than before.</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking about that made you so lost in thought?” asked Qing Shui towards Di Chen who was in his embrace with a smile.</p>
 <p>“No, I just feel that you’re particularly bad now.”</p>
 <p>“Bad? Where am I bad at?”asked Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You’re acting very bad now.” replied Di Chen and she raised her head and smiled towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Since you say I’m bad, what about now.” say Qing Shui. Immediately after saying it, pressed Di Chen down under him and blocked the panicky little mouth with a kiss as he greedily sucked on.</p>
 <p>Only after a long while did he relax and said to her: “ I feel that I can’t continue to resist eating you up now.”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, can you give me some more time?” asked Di Chen softly as she looked at Qing Shui with a faint distressed look on her face.</p>
 <p>“Chen Er, I will never ever make you do something that you’re not willing to do.” replied Qing Shui with a faint smile while he sat up and he brushed her luxurious hair.</p>
