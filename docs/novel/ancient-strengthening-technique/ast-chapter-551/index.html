 <p><strong>Chapter 551 Returning to Heavenly Palace, Violet Gold Divine Shield unsealed?.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>551 [Returning to Heavenly Palace, Violet Gold Divine Shield unsealed?]</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s next course of action was to watch the many Qing Clan members practice. After all, when they watched Qing Shui exhibit the Tiger Form, a portion of them gained some inspiration.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was best for them to try and understand it while it is was still fresh in their minds, thus everyone was busy practicing, some of them were even repeating the same move over and over again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou stood there with her eyes closed, her face was peaceful. Qing Shui happened to see her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Enlightenment?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui unhurriedly and quietly stopped everyone, then he sat down noiselessly. No one was allowed to make any sounds.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also felt especially excited, he had not had entered the state of enlightenment for a long time. This kind of instant enlightenment was something every cultivator wished for.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Mingyue Gelou’s holy and dignified complexion and his heart felt gratified. This was a woman that had a bitter life, Qing Shui hoped that she could become happy, hoped that she would grow strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her meridians were naturally cleared from birth, and she was a cultivating genius. It's a pity that she started a little late, but she finally had a chance after meeting him, now she was having her first enlightenment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even during her breakthrough to the Xiantian Realm, she did not have a moment of enlightenment. This was her opportunity to make great leaps, only, he did not know how long would her enlightenment would last for.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Being able to be in the enlightened state for 15 minutes could be considered pretty good, most people could only last a few breaths of time, and many of them weren’t even sure if they were in a state of enlightenment or merely in a daze. If there was a great change in strength, it was enlightenment, if there was no change, then they were in a daze……&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, an hour went by!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou’s complexion seemed even holier and more dignified, she even had a divine look. Qing Shui happily looked at Mingyue Gelou, hoping that she would stay in that state for as long as possible.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">2 hours!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou’s long eyelashes trembled, and she opened her bright eyes. Her atmosphere had a subtle change to it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In an instant, a vigor slow arose!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Roar!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a huge roar released by the Tiger's Roar, it was different from Qing Shui’s heaven-shaking Tiger’s Roar. The roar released by Mingyu Gelou lacked a heavy shock, but instead, had a strong penetrative force.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, Mingyue Gelou performed a Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Si!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A faint gray line about the thickness of a finger appeared, at the same time, Mingyue Gelou’s whole body radiated a white light!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She broke through!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled at the graceful woman who was still bathed in light, her speed was not inferior to his compared to when he first broke through to a martial king. She was now also a Martial King.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In just a few years, Mingyue Gelou transformed from a weak girl, who did not know martial arts, to the current Martial King cultivator she was now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Qing Clan, especially Qing You and his group, including Qing Bei, were happy but also suffered a deep blow to their confidence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Bei breaking through to Xiantian already caused the rest to suffer a blow. Qing Bei was a little happy then, but now, she felt embarrassed. When she thought about it, the women around Qing Shui all seemed to be strong beyond compare. Their ages weren’t that great either, even the youngest one was just a few years older than her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The glow slowly faded away and Mingyue Gelou happily looked around. She then saw the surrounding people were quietly looking at her, and she knew that everyone was afraid of interrupting her enlightenment, and thus had remained quiet. She embarrassedly and happily thanked everyone!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister-in-law, we are all of one family, there is no need to be courteous.” Qing You laughed mischievously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Exactly!” Qing Hu chimed in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a small interlude, everyone stopped everyone they were doing and frantically practiced the Tiger’s Form. As for Qing Shui, he explained why this was a suitable place to practice the Tiger’s Form.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, Mingyue Gelou, Qing Yi, and the other girls prepared some barbecued meat and meat soup. They also found some wild vegetables and made some vegetable dishes. Qing Shui’s culinary arts and use of spices were incomparably great.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone ate happily, but Qing Shui was the happiest. After the Fire Bird broke through, it was not inferior to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, after all, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could not fly. Any flying beast before the Martial Saint Realm would not be able to compare to it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With Mingyue Gelou’s breakthrough to the Martial King Ream, there was another strong cultivator in the Qing Clan. Most importantly, Qing Shui believed that with Mingyue Gelou’s aptitude, after several years, she could become incomparably strong. This was &nbsp;because now that she was in the Martial King Realm. Qing Shui had a few pills that she could use, had she used them earlier, it would have been a waste.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most importantly, there was still Luan Luan, the girl with the Heart of Seven Orifices. Qing Shui’s expectations for her were very high, especially after she tamed the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. It had eaten the Beast Pil, causing its strength to increase explosively, it was now a low-leveled Peak Martial King. The strength of the lowest Peak Martial King would be at least two countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear may only have the strength of&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">two countries but its defense was perversely strong. It was a good thing that the strongest attacks of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear used fire and not its physical body. However, in the later stages, its physical body would also become strong, this was the characteristics of demonic beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When it was night, Qing Shui &nbsp;once again went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He practiced the Tiger’s Form, the movements of his arms seemed to be particularly smooth, and each strike contained an explosive strength. Qing Shui was not sure if he had touched the boundaries of the Martial Saint Realm yet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was sure that his Tiger’s Form had increased in realm because it had an additional 100 thousand Jin of strength. This was the reason why Qing Shui was so sure, only when the realm increased would there be such a phenomena.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">100 thousand Jin of strength was not worth mentioning to Qing Shui but it was better than nothing. Once must know that the price of a pill that could raise one’s strength by 100 thousand Jin would be astronomical in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Earlier, Mingyue Gelou had discovered the same thing. Although to Qing Shui, this increase of 100 thousand Jin of strength was nothing, to Mingyue Gelou, it made a huge difference. It had increased her strength as an early Martial King significantly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only stopped after he practiced the Tiger’s Form for an hour!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Overall, Qing Shui felt quite satisfied, after all, he was able to strike out with the force of a Martial Saint. Suddenly, he thought of the Dark Green Divine Stone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taking out the Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui felt happy in his heart. A stone that could release seals, he wondered how many layers of seals it could remove from the Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed previously that the Dark Green Divine Stone had the word ‘damaged’, thus Qing Shui felt that it was difficult to completely unseal the seal of the Violet Gold Divine Shield with it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The method of undoing the seal was quite simple, smelt the Dark Green Divine Stone then mix it into the Violet Gold Divine Shield. This did not seem difficult, after all, it was rare to find such a miraculous stone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After 30 minutes, the Violet Gold Divine Shield radiated a bright violet light, it looked even more resplendent that before, sparkling with a translucent noble air that could cause people to gasp in surprise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Violet Gold Divine Shield: An ancient lost item of the World of the Nine Continents, has mystical effects!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effects: the person using the Violet Gold Divine Shield will have a 100 percent increase in physical strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Inherent technique: Divine Armor, Can defend against 50% of the opponent’s damage for one hour!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Passive skill: Divine Bash, when using the Violet Gold Divine Shield to bash, there will be an addition 20 percent of the body’s strength added to the attack.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Usage requirement: the body’s strength has to reach the strength of one country.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Status: Sealed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw this, he was excited, the attacking power increased by a fold, and when using the shield to attack, it would increase the attacking power by 20 percent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the speed reducing effect was gone. Now, this Violet Gold Divine Shield could finally be considered a divine level item. Holding the Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui felt as if his speed had increased significantly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, it previously decreased 30 percent of his speed, when that restraint was gone, the feeling was different. If Feng Shamo had the current Violet Gold Divine Shield with him, Qing Shui would have died already.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Eh? It is still sealed?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the status behind and saw that is was still sealed. The attribute of reducing speed is already removed, it even grew a lot stronger, but why is it still sealed?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thinking for another 15 minutes, Qing Shui felt that this was actually a good thing. It did not matter if he could unseal it right noow or not.. As long as he unsealed it in the future, this Violet Gold Divine Shield would be even stronger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird were both outside, under such desolated conditions, Qing Shui could peacefully cultivate in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The second day, during morning practice, he discovered that the three generations of the Qing Clan had all gotten up even earlier than him. Everyone was bitterly training the Tiger’s Form. There was an idiom that stated that if the time was right, and the geographical and social conditions were favorable, it meant a fortuitous opportunity. This piece of land had favorable geographical conditions for training the Tiger’s Form. It was even better for it than the Heavenly Palace with its dense Spiritual Qi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui did not immediately practice the Tiger’s Form, instead, he practiced the Taichi Fist. This was a habit that was ingrained deep into his bones, regardless of anything, he would not lose this habit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After finishing the Taichi Fist, he gave the rest some pointers and explained some of the things that they needed to pay attention to and some tricks. They had gained a lot, even Mingyue Gelou was seriously listening.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Gelou, don't just listen, you are now in the same realm as me, you can share some of your experiences with them.” Qing Shui laughed boisterously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Eh? I just watched you practiced then I unknowingly broke through.” Mingyue Gelou’s face went red.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This favorable geographical location was not a result of Spiritual Qi, but allowed people to cultivate the Tiger’s Form faster. It was because this was the best environment for tigers to live in, regardless of encouraging the procreation of tigers or their longevity, it was the best.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three months later!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and his group arrived at the Continent's Capital, and Qing Shui directly brought them up the Heavenly Palace’s mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He brought the group of Qing Clan members to Cang Wuya and introduced them. After all, they were his family, as for Cang Wuya, he had talked about him to many of the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya spoke warmly with everyone, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li also came out and happily greeted all of them. They had not seen each other for half a year and sorely missed each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old master, Qing Yi thanks you for caring for Qing Shui.” Qing Yi bowed to Cang Wuya in gratitude.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi only knew that Cang Wuya saved Qing Shui’s life, just based on that, it was sufficient.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Dear child, we are all of one family, don't be so courteous, come inside the house.” Cang Wuya was exceptionally happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The size of Cang Wuya’s living room was just nice, despite the large number of people, they were not cramped and did not have to squeeze into each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old master, nothing happened to the Heavenly Palace during this period of time right?” Qing Shui could tell from Cang Wuya’s expression that there were no unexpected incidents.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, everything went smoothly, it is just that the powers withinthe Starday Hall has changed. The Feng Clan was no longer suitable, and now the Wu Clan is holding the reins. Because you left, we could not get this approved.” Cang Wuya laughed loudly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No harm done, actually it does not matter who are the Palace Masters of each Hall. If he could rise to that position, it is the results of his abilities. However, in regards to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, the Old Ancestor had instructed me not to change him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui arranged for the Qing Clan to stay in a three-storied pavilions 100 meters beyond Cang Wuya’s place. This way, there would be someone to take care of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, temporarily stay here for a period of time first. When I’ve found a house and shop in the Continent's Capital then we will go over there.” Qing Shui said after making the arrangements for the Qing Clan’s residence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, no problems, Qing Shui, go deal with your matters first, there is no rush.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you all want to join the Heavenly Palace?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qing You, Qing Bei, and the others.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, I will leave together with grandfather, wait till I break into the Xiantian Realm then I will join the Heavenly Palace.” Qing You thought seriously before replying.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing You’s words shocked Qing Shui, this guy kept making a fuss about entering the Heavenly Palace, then finding a Xiantian Realm wife. Now, he actually made this decision, it seems that he still had quite a strong ego, for him to make such a big decision.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, those who had not reached the Xiantian Realm said that they would not join the Heavenly Palace. They said they could not break the rules of the Heavenly Palace, when they said that, Qing Shui felt very happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, the only ones who joined the Heavenly Palace were Qing Bei and Luan Luan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was settled. When Qing Shui saw the sky, he went towards the back mountain!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since he left, it had &nbsp;almost beef half a year, Qing Shui did not know how Elder Ge was doing, thus he went to check. Qing Shui did not want this strong old man to descend into negativity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From a distance, he saw Elder Ge practicing his sword under the summer sun. The last time he came, it had just become spring, now summer was almost over.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hearing footsteps, Elder Ge turned his head and saw that it was Qing Shui. He stopped and smiled at Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How have you been recently Elder Ge?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Good, thank you, did you just get back?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ve been back for half a day, how is your body feeling now?” Qing Shui looking at Elder Ge, who had reached the early Martial King Realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Your medicine and acupuncture skills are very impressive. In this half year, especially at the start, my strength improved crazily, but after awhile, it slowed down.” Elder Ge had a smile radiating with happiness as he said that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It has been half a year, that is normal. It is about time for acupuncture again, let’s begin now!” Qing Shui had calculated the time back then, the next acupuncture session could not be in more than half a year later, now about half a year had passed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, the acupuncture points required an obvious increase in strength. &nbsp;About 80 percent of the acupoints on Elder Ge’s body had been pricked before, although this process was smooth, it was still a little dangerous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Four Hours!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just acupuncture alone used four hours, almost half the day had already went by. Now, Qing Shui’s acupuncture technique had some strengthening effect on the foundation of human bones and also a marrow cleansing effect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just this acupuncture session caused Elder Ge’s strength to rise from Grade One Martial King to Grade Three Martial King. Of course, if Qing Shui used the acupuncture techniques on him again, he would still be a Grade Three &nbsp;Martial King. This kind of acupuncture was like eating medicine, after the first one, the second one would not be effective. Even if you increased the dosage, there would not be any effects, it might even cause his body to be not able to withstand it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Acupuncture opens up one’s potential to a certain extent, this was one of the effects of acupuncture that could not be overlooked!</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>551 [Returning to Heavenly Palace, Violet Gold Divine Shield unsealed?]</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s next course of action was to watch the many Qing Clan members practice. After all, when they watched Qing Shui exhibit the Tiger Form, a portion of them gained some inspiration.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was best for them to try and understand it while it is was still fresh in their minds, thus everyone was busy practicing, some of them were even repeating the same move over and over again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou stood there with her eyes closed, her face was peaceful. Qing Shui happened to see her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Enlightenment?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui unhurriedly and quietly stopped everyone, then he sat down noiselessly. No one was allowed to make any sounds.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also felt especially excited, he had not had entered the state of enlightenment for a long time. This kind of instant enlightenment was something every cultivator wished for.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Mingyue Gelou’s holy and dignified complexion and his heart felt gratified. This was a woman that had a bitter life, Qing Shui hoped that she could become happy, hoped that she would grow strong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her meridians were naturally cleared from birth, and she was a cultivating genius. It's a pity that she started a little late, but she finally had a chance after meeting him, now she was having her first enlightenment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even during her breakthrough to the Xiantian Realm, she did not have a moment of enlightenment. This was her opportunity to make great leaps, only, he did not know how long would her enlightenment would last for.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Being able to be in the enlightened state for 15 minutes could be considered pretty good, most people could only last a few breaths of time, and many of them weren’t even sure if they were in a state of enlightenment or merely in a daze. If there was a great change in strength, it was enlightenment, if there was no change, then they were in a daze……&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, an hour went by!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou’s complexion seemed even holier and more dignified, she even had a divine look. Qing Shui happily looked at Mingyue Gelou, hoping that she would stay in that state for as long as possible.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">2 hours!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou’s long eyelashes trembled, and she opened her bright eyes. Her atmosphere had a subtle change to it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In an instant, a vigor slow arose!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Roar!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a huge roar released by the Tiger's Roar, it was different from Qing Shui’s heaven-shaking Tiger’s Roar. The roar released by Mingyu Gelou lacked a heavy shock, but instead, had a strong penetrative force.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After that, Mingyue Gelou performed a Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Si!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A faint gray line about the thickness of a finger appeared, at the same time, Mingyue Gelou’s whole body radiated a white light!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She broke through!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled at the graceful woman who was still bathed in light, her speed was not inferior to his compared to when he first broke through to a martial king. She was now also a Martial King.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In just a few years, Mingyue Gelou transformed from a weak girl, who did not know martial arts, to the current Martial King cultivator she was now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Qing Clan, especially Qing You and his group, including Qing Bei, were happy but also suffered a deep blow to their confidence.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Bei breaking through to Xiantian already caused the rest to suffer a blow. Qing Bei was a little happy then, but now, she felt embarrassed. When she thought about it, the women around Qing Shui all seemed to be strong beyond compare. Their ages weren’t that great either, even the youngest one was just a few years older than her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The glow slowly faded away and Mingyue Gelou happily looked around. She then saw the surrounding people were quietly looking at her, and she knew that everyone was afraid of interrupting her enlightenment, and thus had remained quiet. She embarrassedly and happily thanked everyone!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister-in-law, we are all of one family, there is no need to be courteous.” Qing You laughed mischievously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Exactly!” Qing Hu chimed in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a small interlude, everyone stopped everyone they were doing and frantically practiced the Tiger’s Form. As for Qing Shui, he explained why this was a suitable place to practice the Tiger’s Form.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, Mingyue Gelou, Qing Yi, and the other girls prepared some barbecued meat and meat soup. They also found some wild vegetables and made some vegetable dishes. Qing Shui’s culinary arts and use of spices were incomparably great.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone ate happily, but Qing Shui was the happiest. After the Fire Bird broke through, it was not inferior to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, after all, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could not fly. Any flying beast before the Martial Saint Realm would not be able to compare to it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With Mingyue Gelou’s breakthrough to the Martial King Ream, there was another strong cultivator in the Qing Clan. Most importantly, Qing Shui believed that with Mingyue Gelou’s aptitude, after several years, she could become incomparably strong. This was &nbsp;because now that she was in the Martial King Realm. Qing Shui had a few pills that she could use, had she used them earlier, it would have been a waste.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most importantly, there was still Luan Luan, the girl with the Heart of Seven Orifices. Qing Shui’s expectations for her were very high, especially after she tamed the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. It had eaten the Beast Pil, causing its strength to increase explosively, it was now a low-leveled Peak Martial King. The strength of the lowest Peak Martial King would be at least two countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear may only have the strength of&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">two countries but its defense was perversely strong. It was a good thing that the strongest attacks of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear used fire and not its physical body. However, in the later stages, its physical body would also become strong, this was the characteristics of demonic beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When it was night, Qing Shui &nbsp;once again went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He practiced the Tiger’s Form, the movements of his arms seemed to be particularly smooth, and each strike contained an explosive strength. Qing Shui was not sure if he had touched the boundaries of the Martial Saint Realm yet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was sure that his Tiger’s Form had increased in realm because it had an additional 100 thousand Jin of strength. This was the reason why Qing Shui was so sure, only when the realm increased would there be such a phenomena.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">100 thousand Jin of strength was not worth mentioning to Qing Shui but it was better than nothing. Once must know that the price of a pill that could raise one’s strength by 100 thousand Jin would be astronomical in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Earlier, Mingyue Gelou had discovered the same thing. Although to Qing Shui, this increase of 100 thousand Jin of strength was nothing, to Mingyue Gelou, it made a huge difference. It had increased her strength as an early Martial King significantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only stopped after he practiced the Tiger’s Form for an hour!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Overall, Qing Shui felt quite satisfied, after all, he was able to strike out with the force of a Martial Saint. Suddenly, he thought of the Dark Green Divine Stone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Taking out the Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui felt happy in his heart. A stone that could release seals, he wondered how many layers of seals it could remove from the Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed previously that the Dark Green Divine Stone had the word ‘damaged’, thus Qing Shui felt that it was difficult to completely unseal the seal of the Violet Gold Divine Shield with it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The method of undoing the seal was quite simple, smelt the Dark Green Divine Stone then mix it into the Violet Gold Divine Shield. This did not seem difficult, after all, it was rare to find such a miraculous stone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After 30 minutes, the Violet Gold Divine Shield radiated a bright violet light, it looked even more resplendent that before, sparkling with a translucent noble air that could cause people to gasp in surprise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Violet Gold Divine Shield: An ancient lost item of the World of the Nine Continents, has mystical effects!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effects: the person using the Violet Gold Divine Shield will have a 100 percent increase in physical strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Inherent technique: Divine Armor, Can defend against 50% of the opponent’s damage for one hour!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Passive skill: Divine Bash, when using the Violet Gold Divine Shield to bash, there will be an addition 20 percent of the body’s strength added to the attack.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Usage requirement: the body’s strength has to reach the strength of one country.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Status: Sealed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw this, he was excited, the attacking power increased by a fold, and when using the shield to attack, it would increase the attacking power by 20 percent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the speed reducing effect was gone. Now, this Violet Gold Divine Shield could finally be considered a divine level item. Holding the Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui felt as if his speed had increased significantly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, it previously decreased 30 percent of his speed, when that restraint was gone, the feeling was different. If Feng Shamo had the current Violet Gold Divine Shield with him, Qing Shui would have died already.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Eh? It is still sealed?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the status behind and saw that is was still sealed. The attribute of reducing speed is already removed, it even grew a lot stronger, but why is it still sealed?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thinking for another 15 minutes, Qing Shui felt that this was actually a good thing. It did not matter if he could unseal it right noow or not.. As long as he unsealed it in the future, this Violet Gold Divine Shield would be even stronger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird were both outside, under such desolated conditions, Qing Shui could peacefully cultivate in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The second day, during morning practice, he discovered that the three generations of the Qing Clan had all gotten up even earlier than him. Everyone was bitterly training the Tiger’s Form. There was an idiom that stated that if the time was right, and the geographical and social conditions were favorable, it meant a fortuitous opportunity. This piece of land had favorable geographical conditions for training the Tiger’s Form. It was even better for it than the Heavenly Palace with its dense Spiritual Qi.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui did not immediately practice the Tiger’s Form, instead, he practiced the Taichi Fist. This was a habit that was ingrained deep into his bones, regardless of anything, he would not lose this habit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After finishing the Taichi Fist, he gave the rest some pointers and explained some of the things that they needed to pay attention to and some tricks. They had gained a lot, even Mingyue Gelou was seriously listening.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Gelou, don't just listen, you are now in the same realm as me, you can share some of your experiences with them.” Qing Shui laughed boisterously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Eh? I just watched you practiced then I unknowingly broke through.” Mingyue Gelou’s face went red.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This favorable geographical location was not a result of Spiritual Qi, but allowed people to cultivate the Tiger’s Form faster. It was because this was the best environment for tigers to live in, regardless of encouraging the procreation of tigers or their longevity, it was the best.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Three months later!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and his group arrived at the Continent's Capital, and Qing Shui directly brought them up the Heavenly Palace’s mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He brought the group of Qing Clan members to Cang Wuya and introduced them. After all, they were his family, as for Cang Wuya, he had talked about him to many of the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya spoke warmly with everyone, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li also came out and happily greeted all of them. They had not seen each other for half a year and sorely missed each other.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old master, Qing Yi thanks you for caring for Qing Shui.” Qing Yi bowed to Cang Wuya in gratitude.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi only knew that Cang Wuya saved Qing Shui’s life, just based on that, it was sufficient.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Dear child, we are all of one family, don't be so courteous, come inside the house.” Cang Wuya was exceptionally happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The size of Cang Wuya’s living room was just nice, despite the large number of people, they were not cramped and did not have to squeeze into each other.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old master, nothing happened to the Heavenly Palace during this period of time right?” Qing Shui could tell from Cang Wuya’s expression that there were no unexpected incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, everything went smoothly, it is just that the powers withinthe Starday Hall has changed. The Feng Clan was no longer suitable, and now the Wu Clan is holding the reins. Because you left, we could not get this approved.” Cang Wuya laughed loudly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No harm done, actually it does not matter who are the Palace Masters of each Hall. If he could rise to that position, it is the results of his abilities. However, in regards to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, the Old Ancestor had instructed me not to change him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui arranged for the Qing Clan to stay in a three-storied pavilions 100 meters beyond Cang Wuya’s place. This way, there would be someone to take care of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, temporarily stay here for a period of time first. When I’ve found a house and shop in the Continent's Capital then we will go over there.” Qing Shui said after making the arrangements for the Qing Clan’s residence.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En, no problems, Qing Shui, go deal with your matters first, there is no rush.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you all want to join the Heavenly Palace?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qing You, Qing Bei, and the others.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, I will leave together with grandfather, wait till I break into the Xiantian Realm then I will join the Heavenly Palace.” Qing You thought seriously before replying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing You’s words shocked Qing Shui, this guy kept making a fuss about entering the Heavenly Palace, then finding a Xiantian Realm wife. Now, he actually made this decision, it seems that he still had quite a strong ego, for him to make such a big decision.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, those who had not reached the Xiantian Realm said that they would not join the Heavenly Palace. They said they could not break the rules of the Heavenly Palace, when they said that, Qing Shui felt very happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, the only ones who joined the Heavenly Palace were Qing Bei and Luan Luan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was settled. When Qing Shui saw the sky, he went towards the back mountain!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since he left, it had &nbsp;almost beef half a year, Qing Shui did not know how Elder Ge was doing, thus he went to check. Qing Shui did not want this strong old man to descend into negativity.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From a distance, he saw Elder Ge practicing his sword under the summer sun. The last time he came, it had just become spring, now summer was almost over.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hearing footsteps, Elder Ge turned his head and saw that it was Qing Shui. He stopped and smiled at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How have you been recently Elder Ge?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Good, thank you, did you just get back?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ve been back for half a day, how is your body feeling now?” Qing Shui looking at Elder Ge, who had reached the early Martial King Realm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Your medicine and acupuncture skills are very impressive. In this half year, especially at the start, my strength improved crazily, but after awhile, it slowed down.” Elder Ge had a smile radiating with happiness as he said that.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It has been half a year, that is normal. It is about time for acupuncture again, let’s begin now!” Qing Shui had calculated the time back then, the next acupuncture session could not be in more than half a year later, now about half a year had passed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, the acupuncture points required an obvious increase in strength. &nbsp;About 80 percent of the acupoints on Elder Ge’s body had been pricked before, although this process was smooth, it was still a little dangerous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Four Hours!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just acupuncture alone used four hours, almost half the day had already went by. Now, Qing Shui’s acupuncture technique had some strengthening effect on the foundation of human bones and also a marrow cleansing effect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just this acupuncture session caused Elder Ge’s strength to rise from Grade One Martial King to Grade Three Martial King. Of course, if Qing Shui used the acupuncture techniques on him again, he would still be a Grade Three &nbsp;Martial King. This kind of acupuncture was like eating medicine, after the first one, the second one would not be effective. Even if you increased the dosage, there would not be any effects, it might even cause his body to be not able to withstand it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Acupuncture opens up one’s potential to a certain extent, this was one of the effects of acupuncture that could not be overlooked!</p>
