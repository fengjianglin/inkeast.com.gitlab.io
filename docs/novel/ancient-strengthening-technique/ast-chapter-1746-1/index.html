If you were really to die, aren't you afraid that I'd be upset?" Qing Shui shook his head.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, I don't want you to take risks for me. Moreover, it's for an uncertain reason."</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Even if I don't have the Sacred Mudra Flower, I still have other means. Without my permission, you can forget about leaving. No one can take you away from me." Qing Shui said firmly.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui..."</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Promise me that you'll live on strongly. You mustn't have thoughts of dying easily. I'm still waiting for the day when you'll become my wife. We haven't had our wedding banquet yet. Didn't you want to have my child? When you recover, let's have one, alright?" Qing Shui gave a bunch of reasons that would make Luo Qingcheng try harder to live on.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person's will was very important to their vitality. Where a person's will was focused on would cause that their attitude towards that area to be extremely headstrong. It was like life. Some people could survive in an unimaginable environment. It was all due to the effect of one's willpower.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress' eyes glowed as she looked at Qing Shui, blushing. She felt very warm inside. She really looked forward for that day to come, and she really wanted a child between them. With a child, she would have things to do and wouldn't feel lonely...</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is it really possible?" Luo Qingcheng looked at Qing Shui hopefully.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course. When we go back, I'll apply acupuncture on you. There are plenty of miraculous medicines in the world and there's also my medical skills. I can assure you." Qing Shui thought of his alchemy recipe. He was still short a little experience to reach the&nbsp;Reborn Pellet. When the recipe came out, he wondered when he would be able to gather all the medicine required. This was a bit far fetched and might not be able to be applied to the current situation.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui still decided to advance on both sides. He would head for the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave while concurrently hoping that his recipe would turn up. However, he placed greater hopes on being able to find the Sacred Mudra Flower.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I promise you. But you must also promise me that nothing must happen to you. There are many people who need you and you aren't alone." Luo Qingcheng said softly. She knew that she wouldn't be able to stop Qing Shui, but she also knew that this man knew what his priorities were. Therefore, it'd be fine for her to just remind him.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, I know. I have always been lucky and my ability to stay alive is still quite strong. No matter how dangerous it is, I'll be able to retreat unscathed." Qing Shui wasn't boasting when he said this.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui picked up the Sun Shooting Bow. When he killed the group from earlier, this divine artifact had dropped. Qing Shui had tried using the bow before in the past but didn't really like it. However, with the mutation to the Yin-Yang Image, he now felt that he should try to use it. If he were to encounter someone close to him who was suitable for it, he could give it out. The prowess of the bow was of course very powerful.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that there were no more&nbsp;Immortal Slaying Arrows. However, Qing Shui still had his forging skills and could forge his own arrows. He had quite a lot of forging materials anyway and could also look for other forging materials.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui helped her treat her external wounds and got her to take the rest of the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus. Although she still appeared a little pale, she could now do things ordinary people could do. However, before her injuries fully recovered, her cultivation was close to nothing.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Qingcheng sat up from Qing Shui's embrace and tidied her clothes. Her face was still a little flushed as she looked at Qing Shui with an indescribable gaze.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's heart felt very heavy. This lady could give up her life for him. What more could a man ask for when there was a lady who could go to such miles for him?</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What he said earlier weren't lies. There were no one who wouldn't like Luo Qingcheng. Ordinary men would all like her. His soul was that of a modern person, and although he also thought of having multiple wives and concubines, he was still a very traditional person deep inside and would only harbor such thoughts alone. Most importantly, he already have quite a number of women. Each of them would give him the feeling that he was undeserving of them. In this world, all strong experts had plenty of wives and concubines, but he still found it hard to face this.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The events today made Qing Shui understand once again that he must treasure the people before him, and not leave any regrets for himself and the people who loved him. This was also why he said earlier that he wanted her to become his woman.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Qingcheng looked at Qing Shui and could not help but recall his worried expression from earlier. He had even said that he wanted to have a child with her. For a moment, she was filled with both yearning and embarrassment.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just then, Shui Yunfeng came back with Muyun Qingge, as well as Qing Shui's demonic beasts in their beast forms--the Dark Phoenix and Dragon Elephant.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Qingcheng had already stood up and Muyun Qingge quickly walked over, "How is it? Are you feeling better?"</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Muyun Qingge's concerned gaze, Luo Qingcheng felt very warm inside as well. Although they weren't blood-related sisters, they were closer to each other than blood-related sisters. Earlier, when Muyun Qingge saw Luo Qingcheng struck by an arrow, her mind had turned blank.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qingge, I'm fine now. Right, did you guys find any good stuff?" Luo Qingcheng smiled and asked. Other than her face appearing a little pale, there were no signs of injuries on her.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We didn't find any miraculous medicine, but there were a few pieces of rocks that were quick big. There are also two good weapons and a spear arts manual." Muyun Qingge said disappointedly.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui knew that something like this would happen, he wouldn't have come to the Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path. Although they had gotten a lot of benefits, the future of Luo Qingcheng's life was now an unknown.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's pack up and get ready to head back." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said. He didn't wish to stay here for a moment longer. It was a great fortune for them to come across two treasure chambers, and it was thanks to the Dragon Slaying Beast. Other people might not have been able to find them. Moreover, the Guardian Beasts weren't that easy to deal with.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't feel much about the treasures they had found and got everyone to prepare to leave.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and the group left the Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path on that day. They had stayed for fewer than two days and this place would close down in a week. Everything inside would be wiped out. Of course, there could still be traces of it leaked out.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui wasn't very worried about this. By the time the Ocean Demon Palace found out that he had killed these Ocean Demons, it could be a while later. Right now, the most important thing to him was to find out how he could treat Luo Qingcheng.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave Shui Yunfeng a copy of the&nbsp;Water Attribute Art&nbsp;and some other things. Shui Yunfeng didn't reject them and headed back to the Watermoon Cavern in the meantime.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they returned to the Sunset Sea King Palace, Yiye Jiange also felt very upset upon learning what had happened to Luo Qingcheng. However, she didn't know what to do either and looked at Qing Shui, "I'll go with you to look for the Sacred Mudra Flower."</span></span></p>
