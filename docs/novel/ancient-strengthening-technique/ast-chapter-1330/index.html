 <p><strong>AST 1330 - The Complete Awakening of the Hundred Blossom Body. A second Golden Star, Nine Nine Divine Nebula Formation</strong></p>
 <p>If he was to make assumptions based on the Heavenly Meridians which had been established contact with, he might have already found all twelve of the women in the Portraits of Beauty. Despite this, he kept on having a feeling that things weren’t that simple. But he stopped thinking about it after thinking for just a while. He decided to go with the flow. Even he himself might not be able to see all twelve of the Portraits of Beauty. Could the final two be Yu Sunu and Mu Qing?</p>
 <p>This time, Wenren Wu-shuang had benefited even more. She managed to catch up and became the first person to achieve State Master grade. If she was in the Western Oxhe Continent, even Qing Sha would be considered a State Master. But this was the five continents they were talking about, merely a State Master was enough to sweep across the entire five continents.</p>
 <p>Could it be that it was because she was one of the women from the Portraits of Beauty? Or could it have to do with her own strength? Not only did Wenren Wu-shuang manage to achieve State Master grade, her body was even filled with mysterious strength. This energy was colored a bit blue and a bit red. This should have something to do with her unique body type. This time, she was considered to have awakened her body physique. In the future, her strength would improve very quickly and at a frightening rate.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui didn’t intentionally try to control his sperm. Now, he wasn’t worried about getting them pregnant. He believed that in the future, by relying on the Nine Continents Boots and Five Elements Divine Flag, shuttling back and forth between the nine continents shouldn’t be a hard task.</p>
 <p>In the past, even though he hadn’t discussed with Wenren Wu-shuang, he could tell that she really liked children during the day. Wenren Wugou was no longer here, himself and the people from Qing Clan were the people closest to her. It might be a good idea to have children too.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Daddy, buns, I want to eat some jade steamed buns.” Qing Yun ran here when she saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately picked her up, “Little brat, be patient, your mother and the others are making them now. It will be done in a while.”</p>
 <p>He has given Qing Clan a lot. Even the pond in Qing Clan had been filled up with the fish, turtles, crabs, prawns and so on from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. In any case, reproduction no longer posed an issue within the realm as of now. If it wasn’t because the pond evolved into a small lake, it was likely that it wouldn’t have been big enough to contain everything.</p>
 <p>He even put a few Longevity Fish into the pond so that they could use it to make Longevity Noodles whenever the seniors in the clan had their birthday. As for the rest of the fish, they would eat them on regular days. Those which he put in the past were all gone now. He had forgotten about this last time. Hence, he needed to come back every month now. Things were more convenient this way. Every time he filled up the pond, it would have been enough for them to eat for up to half a year. After all, the amount which he put in was quite desirable.</p>
 <p>During the day, he continued to help the people go through Impurities Cleansing, Constitution Nurturing and building their foundation through acupuncture. Whenever he felt tired, he would go into the realm to rest and conveniently refine some medicines. Just like this, a few days time passed.</p>
 <p>In Qing Clan, regardless of whether they were adults or children, they were all being Constitution Nurtured with Life and Death Needles. They also went through Impurities Cleansing once. Furthermore, they also had the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet, Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet, Golden Snake Pellet, the Bone Strengthening Pill and so on, which were all the upgraded versions with Spring of Life and the crystals added in them. They still had particularly good effect.</p>
 <p>For the past few nights, other than the first day, Qing Shui had been rushing about from one room to another for the remaining nights. Basically, he didn’t get to rest throughout the whole night. He wanted to sleep with all the girls at the same time. But he knew that now wasn’t the time to do it. He didn’t want to make things difficult for the girls. He knew that they were all proud women. He already felt satisfied being able to do this.</p>
 <p>Today at night, after hesitating for a while, Qing Shui opened Yu He’s room door.</p>
 <p>Yu He who was in her pajamas, had a kind of attractiveness which couldn’t be described with words. It was just that she seemed a bit weak now. She smiled upon seeing Qing Shui, “Is there anything you need, looking for me so late?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, there is something I need to discuss with you!” Qing Shui entered her room and locked the door.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui felt that Yu He’s heart had started beating faster. However, he chose to not say anything about it. Instead, he stared at her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled, “Let’s talk!”</p>
 <p>Pu-chi!</p>
 <p>“The reason why you locked the door is just to talk to me?” Yu He said in a bit of a joking as well as happy manner.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t we go and talk about it on the bed?” Qing Shui said while holding her hand.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, just what position do I have in your heart?” Yu He asked in a depressed tone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He held her hand and sat down together with her on the sofa beside him, “Actually, I already started liking you back in the days when we were in Hundred Miles City. It’s just that back then, you used to treat me like a child. Actually, I have never forgotten about you. I will feel sad if you throw yourself into someone else’s arms. But I won’t make any noise, despite how much I’d suffer. That time, when I saw you and when I found out the things which you had been doing throughout these years, at that time, I suddenly realized that I need to hold you within my arms.”</p>
 <p>“I have always loved you. But I somehow felt that I was never able to catch up to you. Even now, I still feel the same. Qing Shui, tell me, what shall I do?”</p>
 <p>“What do you want to catch up to me in? Your martial arts skills?” Qing Shui looked at her.</p>
 <p>“More or less!”</p>
 <p>“You have to feel that you are a match against me. Only then will you feel something when you are with me. The reason why we are together is to ensure that we are able to fight against each other.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I want to help you!” Yu He was a bit speechless. She rolled her eyes at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Love is something which is mutual. Do you think that we can only become husband and wife just because you are of help to me?” Qing Shui looked at the stubborn woman.</p>
 <p>“I know, actually, I have also thought things through when I decided to remain here.” Yu He knew that Qing Shui was already done with the majority of his things. For the things he was doing now, they were things which couldn’t be rushed.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, do you still remember the days back when we were in Hundred Miles City?”</p>
 <p>“Yes I do, you are a little pervert. All you think about is trying to take advantage of me.” When Yu He thought about the days back in Hundred Miles City, she seemed to really miss it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui right away embraced her and let her settle down within his arms. Yu He cried out in surprise. After that, she looked at Qing Shui with an embarrassed expression.</p>
 <p>Despite her clothes being in the way, he still sucked on the bulging spot on her body. Yu He covered up her mouth quickly with her hand. Her body trembled. As for her other hand, she was using it to hug Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
 <p>“Yu He, you are my woman, give yourself to me!” Qing Shui lifted his head and looked at the beautiful woman.</p>
 <p>Mn!</p>
 <p>She let out a soft gentle noise from her nose.</p>
 <p>Yu He was like a young married woman. In comparison, her body was a bit more well-rounded. Yet she was a woman who had yet to experience human intimacy. She married once before, unfortunately, that short-lived man didn’t have the fortune to consummate their marriage.</p>
 <p>Every women possesses charms of their own kind. They have temperaments which are unique to themselves. They each possess their own kind of charisma. Yu He was very daring as she stared at the man who was taking off her clothes.</p>
 <p>More than twenty years, she has known him for more than twenty years.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, have you ever desired men?” Qing Shui’s hands were travelling over land and water. He asked while kissing her ears.</p>
 <p>“Other than you, I have never desired any others. Men aren’t good stuff. But as for you, even if you had been worse, I would still desire you. I have said before, other than you, I am not going to commit myself to any other men in my entire life,” Yu He said gently while hugging Qing Shui’s neck. She sounded really firm when she was saying it.</p>
 <p>“Sorry for making you suffer all these years.” Any men would feel proud if they heard something like this. Let alone with it being said by an extreme beauty like her.</p>
 <p>These words somehow weighed quite significantly. For instance, that killing weapon of Qing Shui’s which was like steel was no longer able to control itself as it squeezed its way through the wet and smooth flowery path.</p>
 <p>The nameless martial technique once again operated.</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>His Sea of Consciousness felt as if it had burst open. The connection between the Heavenly Meridians was yet to be established. However, what Qing Shui was shocked about was that there was an additional golden star within his Sea of Consciousness. The nebula within the Sea of Consciousness had right away expanded onefold.</p>
 <p>For a moment, he felt that his senses had become extremely clear. His entire Spiritual Sense could feel things more clearly now. This meant that each Fire of Life had become even more distinct. In the past, it used to be like black and white. Yet now, it was multi-colored. This was the change which took place when one’s Spiritual Sense got stronger.</p>
 <p>His Spirit Energy had increased onefold. The strength of the Divine Nebula Formation was about to undergo changes too. Now, he should already have been able to cultivate the Nine Nine Divine Nebula Formation.</p>
 <p>But now was still not the time to think about these. The reason being that at this moment, Yu He was undergoing even more dramatic changes than him. Her body was giving off dazzling light. Furthermore, a lot of flowers appeared in the room. Each and every one of the flowers were different. These were Flowers of Spirit Energy. They were all flying in the sky. After that, they combined into a flower dragon and it drilled its way into Yu He’s body. Soon after, a pure energy travelled back and forth between Qing Shui and Yu He.</p>
 <p>The Hundred Flowers Body had completely awakened!</p>
 <p>By the time all of these changes disappeared, Yu He turned around and pressed on Qing Shui with her body. She was blushing as she supported both of her hands on Qing Shui’s chest. She gently moved her slender waist. At that moment, it felt as if the entire world was shaking.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The room quieted down. At the same time, the day was also getting brighter. The sky would have turned completely bright after a while longer. Yu He on the other hand, she was in good spirits. Naturally, so was Qing Shui. The two who were cuddling each other tightly said some intimate things with each other. From time to time, gentle laughing and embarrassing voices would come through.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I am going into seclusion tomorrow. My body physique has awakened completely. I am finally able to cultivate the Hundred Flowers Valley Divine Technique,” Yu He said without the slightest intention to hide anything.</p>
 <p>“Oh, this is a good thing,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I never expected that one could also awaken their body physique through this method. It is really something unimaginable to me,” Yu He said both a bit shocked and a bit embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Then we should do more in the future.”</p>
 <p>“You gangster!”</p>
 <p>“Somebody was the one who pushed me down just now.”</p>
 <p>“Stop saying it, if you say it again, don’t ever think about doing that to me ever again,” Yu He yelled at Qing Shui, annoyed.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, you are about to go into seclusion, why don’t you let me try inserting it for once,” Qing Shui whispered gently into her ear.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Yu He felt both shocked and embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Please? Just help realize this little wish from your husband.” Qing Shui nipped her earlobes.</p>
 <p>Yu He slowly crawled up. She raised her well-rounded and smooth buttocks. That beautiful section of her body was clearly displayed right in front of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Early in the morning on the next day, Yu He had gone into seclusion.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, was cultivating his Nine Nine Divine Nebula Formation. The Nine Nine Divine Nebula Formation which he was unable to achieve despite how hard he worked was now surprisingly progressing very smoothly. Prior to this, he had always lacked the final star. Now, he was already arranging the new golden star which just appeared.</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>The nebula within his consciousness had once again expanded. This was his ocean of Spirit Energy. It’s storage capacity had increased. With that happening, naturally, his Spirit Energy attacks would strengthen. Not only this, the Nine Nine Divine Nebula Formation had also been formed.</p>
 <p>With the Nine Nine Divine Nebula Formation formed, both the Seven Seven and Eight Eight Divine Nebula Formation also disappeared at the same time.</p>
 <p>The Nine-nine Divine Nebula Formation increases the offensive strength of Spirit Energy threefold; this makes it four times as strong. It also increases physical strength onefold. The toughness of the Spirit Energy is increased fourfold. The formation revolves on its own with zero consumption. Attacks however, consume energy like normal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was indulging in his thoughts and feelings for a long time. He never expected his strength to increase so much on his trip back here this time. He had already established contact with eight out of the twelve Heavenly Meridians.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui could achieve an attack worth as much as fifty thousand sun with his Spirit Energy when he used the Seal of Roc. If he managed to meet the odds of receiving a double in prowess, his attack would be able to reach a terrifying amount worth as much as a hundred thousand sun.</p>
 <p>The attack of the Nine Continents Mountain had achieved nearly forty thousand sun. His physical attack was worth nearly twenty thousand sun. When the odds of gaining a double in prowess was met, it would have equal strength to the Nine Continents Mountain. Unfortunately, the Nine Continents Mountain didn’t have any odds of gaining a doubling in prowess. Despite this, it was as stable as physical attacks which gained a double in prowess. The Nine Continents Mountain could be upgraded but unfortunately, it has been a long time since it last managed to evolve.</p>
