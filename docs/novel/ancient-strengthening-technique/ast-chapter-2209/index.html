 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Tai led the way to this Fragrance Shack. The entrance was rather small, about three meters tall. Both doors were about three meters wide. It was considered a small entrance in the Main Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering, they realized that the place was fine-looking. The buildings here did not have many floors. Most of them only had one story. However, it was still very spacious. If it was in the past life, Qing Shui would not dare to stay alone in such a spacious place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many things in the compound, including many ingredients used to make wine. There were also flower petals. Qing Shui also saw a garden far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Qing Shui was looking around, a woman walked over from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui heard from Young Master Tai that this woman was very pretty, he was still perplexed. She seemed to be a young married lady. This was the impression that she gave people from the first sight. It was not from the physical appearance, but her natural flirtatious aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body was no different from a teenage girl, but she was still relatively adequate in the right areas, especially her round and perky chest which stretched her clothes out. The solid shape was so prominent, the tall and round bamboo-shoots type of shape was extremely impactful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body was tall and lean, slightly taller than 1.7 meters. Her legs were straight and slim. There were no traces of her being a married woman at all. The most beautiful part was her face; her dark eyes were like sparkling stars and moon. Yet, these eyes were very cold. It came from the indifference from within her soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her face was as pale as jade, her nose was tall and straight; her dark and long hair was tied up simply, giving out a learned and rational vibe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Qing, this friend of mine wants to see the wine,” Young Master Tai said humbly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had bewildered feeling; he did not expect Young Master Tai to be so low profile in front of a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm, have a look then,” The woman left right after talking; she did not even once look at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice was magnetic and melodious; it was nice to hear but oppressing, making people feel unable to stand up straight while facing her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been ages since Qing Shui had been ignored like this. He was thinking about how to address her previously but she did not even acknowledge him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not get mad, but anyone else would not feel great being neglected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Tai smiled looking at Qing Shui’s face. “Don’t make such a face. You are not handsome so that is normal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m more handsome than you, at least,” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, how could you say that? I don’t mean to belittle you, but if we’re speaking of looks, you are definitely two grades lower than me,” Young Master Tai said while touching his own face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at this big guy before finally giving up. Young Master Tai was indeed handsome, but his good appearance was far behind his narcissism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh yeah, did you come here to just look around?” Young Master Tai asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m here to get the wine recipe, but I don’t harbor any hope after seeing her,” Qing Shui replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Recipes. Usually, they won’t give them to others, unless the offer is exceptionally good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can offer something that she could be interested in, but she probably won’t give me the chance. Did this woman suffer through something in her life? She seems to hate this world.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The entire family of her husband was killed on her wedding night, leaving her alone. Not only that, it was said that someone had left a message, saying that if she marries anyone, his entire family will die.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s surprising that something like this happens. It seems like someone wants to marry her and doesn’t want anyone else to get her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But no one showed up. No one got close to her so this woman has never been close to anyone up till now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know the strength of this woman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Her? Maybe Xiantian level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “She is very strong. Maybe even stronger than me. By the way, when was it that her in-laws were killed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fifty years ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman was still young, not much older than Qing Shui. She should be around Beihuang Fan’s age. However, what was her strength fifty years ago? Did she only improve her strength after all those years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did she not fight and kill at that time?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She did, but the opponent was strong and she was weak. Yet, the opponent did not kill her or harm her,” Young Master Tai said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt muddle-headed now, but he stopped thinking. Perhaps, Nalan Qing had obtained the ability to take revenge. Besides, it was none of his business to care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them looked around casually. Qing Shui looked at the raw materials. Wine mainly depended on its recipe. Without the recipe, given all the ingredients, you could not produce the same wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go and find her and see if we can exchange for the wine recipe,” Qing Shui thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Tai smiled bitterly, but he still headed along with Qing Shui to meet the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the woman was staring blankly at a flower bush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person was more beautiful than the flowers, but she was cold. Qing Shui knew this was not simply that but the result of a tough and strong soul. It was as if a man saw a beautiful tiger but dared not to step forward. That was a kind of fear from the bottom of the heart, but it was also kind of admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want your wine recipe,” Qing Shui directly told the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Tai rubbed his head. Could there really be someone as straightforward as him? Who would give it to you when spoken to like that, lest they were fools?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reason!” The woman turned around. This was her first time meeting someone so straightforward. This person was either a fool or a wise man. He should not be a fool. Though he was with the Young Master Tai, he should not be a fool…</span></p>

I just want to make several types of wine. Your wine takes time to age. I can increase the wine’s age quickly. The duration can be shortened by several times!” Qing Shui possessed the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. More importantly, he also had the Treasure Basin and the Hundred Treasure Chest. With that, he could double it up twice.</span></p>

It was only a small bottle, about 250ml. It was very delicate and plain. Then, he took out a white porcelain glass. He filled half of the glass and gave it to the woman saying, “See if it is to your liking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Tai was intrigued the second the wine was opened. The aroma was one grade better than the Fragrance Wine. One would feel refreshed by just smelling it.</span></p>

She took a little sip, though her expression seemed to have remained the same, there were slight changes. That surprise was spreading like a ripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You made this wine? It has been kept for at least 10,000 years. If it is stored as usual, you would need at least 10,000 years to reach this quality,” The woman still sounded oppressing, but it was charming. It was magnetic and knowledgeable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about I exchange this wine recipe with yours?” Qing Shui proposed with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t make this wine even if you give me this recipe. You should be the only one who owns this plum blossom. The normal plum blossom doesn’t have this kind of chilling and lofty nature. I can’t reach this age as well,” Nalan Qing seemed to have studied the wine well. She hardly spoke so much to a man like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can I exchange for your wine recipe then?” Qing Shui looked at her and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have such a nice thing and you’re interested in my wine recipe?” The woman was confused.</span></p>
