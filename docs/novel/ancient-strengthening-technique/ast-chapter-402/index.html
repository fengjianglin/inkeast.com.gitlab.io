 <p><strong>Chapter 402 Might Elephant Stomp, Diamond Qi, Coquettish.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 402 - Might Elephant Stomp, Diamond Qi, Coquettish</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui regained his consciousness and proceeded to delve further. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Channelling a gigantic Elephant beast through one’s body, the technique was released with a sudden stomp on the ground, followed by a thunderous elephant call. It could raise one’s Qi force and enhance the blood flow rate, which would bring about a strength boost. At the same time, there was a moderate chance of success to lower the Qi force of your opponent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp (Small Success Stage) would raise one’s strength by 20% and the force of the stomp was double one’s strength. This was only limited to one’s base strength and did not include any other fortification.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp (Large Success Stage) would raise one’s strength by 50% and the force of the stomp was five times of one’s strength. This was only limited to one’s base strength and did not include any other fortification.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp (Great Perfection Stage) would raise one’s strength by 100% and the force of the stomp is ten times of one’s strength. This was only limited to one’s base strength and did not include any other fortification.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already very amazed after just reading about the Mighty Elephant Stomp. With his current strength nearly at 3 million jin, under the Small Stage Success, his strength would be increased by a staggering 600,000 jin. The force of his stomp would be 6 million jin. If it was in Great Perfection Stage, it would be 30 million jin. Unfortunately, it was only limited to the force of his stomp. If he were to step on someone’s body with that….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that Mighty Elephant Stomp might not be an easy technique to master.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued reading.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Crossing Waters!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only scanned for the names of the technique and skipped past the descriptions, as he did not have the time now to slowly polish and understand them. Qing Shui had already decided to try Mighty Elephant Stomp, but out of curiosity, he skimmed over the other techniques.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He saw that there were many pictures. What appeared most frequently in the pictures were gigantic, intimidating elephants. Their entire bodies seemed to be sculpted out of golden corundum; their massive bodies were incomparably tough and they did not have a hint of clumsiness.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the pictures, some of the massive golden elephants were trumpeting towards the sky, and from the display of their aura, they seemed to be capable of tearing the skies apart. Some of the pictures also showed the crumbling and torn up ground after the stomps. The strength that tore the ground apart also left many creatures split opened...&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was then followed by a series of pictures that showed battles of these gigantic elephants. There were monstrous bears the size of small mountains and flying beasts in the air. There were gigantic blue pythons with circumferences like that of water jars, and there was even a giant python with evolved horns, or would they be more appropriately called Jiao….?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These were all defeated by the Golden Gigantic Elephants.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui browsed quickly. There were also serene pictures like the Golden Gigantic Elephants resting on the ground….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the most unbelievable image was that of the Golden Gigantic Elephants, not flying, but walking nimbly on the surface of a vast body of water. This was Mighty Elephant Crossing Waters….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly closed his eyes to experience the huge impact the pictures had on him. The imageries in the pictures seemed to flow right in front of Qing Shui. He felt the destruction, the force, the stirring magnificence of their aura. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui opened his eyes again, more than two hours have passed. These images did not enhance Qing Shui’s abilities, but in the two hours, Qing Shui’s visualization of it had changed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was certain that the prowess of the Golden Gigantic Elephant was definitely not lower than that of Martial Saint Level. He felt as if he had personally witnessed a battle between Martial Saint Level beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For many martial artists, it was an extravagant hope to see a battle between Marital Saint Level warriors. Naturally, a battle between Martial Saint Level beasts was so much more rare.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui’s state of mind had calmed down, he went back to studying the specifics of the cultivation techniques for the Mighty Elephant Stomp.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp was a type of “Diamond Qi”. If he could successfully cultivate Diamond Qi, it would be considered as a Small Stage Success. Gaining the ability to fuse that and the cultivators Qi’s essence would be at Large Success Stage. Finally, the Great Perfection Stage would be when there was a total fusion of the two.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was uncertain about his thoughts regarding that introduction. He felt particularly happy because he had a feeling that there was a special connection between “Diamond Qi” and his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The channelling route of Diamond Qi involved the four limbs, the back, and the abdomen; it was found almost throughout the body. Qing Shui was impressed. No wonder it was called “Diamond Qi”.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He bent slightly, almost in an horse stance. Qing Shui shut his eyes and followed the steps in Diamond Qi to slowly channel his Qi without using his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He slowly took in a breath and guided his Qi through the channelling routes in his body as per guided by Diamond Qi.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As time slipped away, Qing Shui could not feel any sense of change in his vital energy. He knew that channelling the elephant form would not be as easy as the other beasts, since the elephant form was so demanding. Success wouldn’t be easy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stopped and thought for a while. Then, he continued practicing, yet he kept failing time after time. After many failures, Qing Shui had become accustomed to it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The following day, Qing Shui woke up very early. He cleaned up quickly and went to the small courtyard. Facing the east direction, he unhurriedly practiced his Taichi Fists and boosted his Nature Energy slightly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;After he finished, Qing Shui saw the door to the hall opening. Canghai Mingyue came out a gave Qing Shui a gentle smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; “You’re awake.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; Qing Shui laughed as he shook away the daze from admiring her beauty. Canghai Mingyue laughed lightly as she saw his slightly flustered expression.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui had left the Heavenly Palace, he had not seen Canghai Mingyue for almost half a year. Time was such a scary thing. Previously, Qing Shui could bravely kiss her, and later, he was able to hug and even tease her a few times.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Now, Qing Shui felt that the feelings he had for her faded, leaving only faint traces and memories.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After answering him, As Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui, she started laughing even louder, so much so that her laughing fit confused Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Am I that funny?” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue quizzically.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have never seen this side of you. It is cute. You look just a shy guy…” Canghai Mingyue explained as she blinked her dark, deep, and beautiful eyes adorably.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing her actions, Qing Shui knew that she must have learnt it unconsciously from Huoyun Liu-li. The thing was that, when such a ravishing beauty as herself does these slightly cute, these slightly enticing little antics, the “lethality” was even higher than those by the lovely cute types of women.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing Qing Shui look at her again with that foolish daze, Canghai Mingyue gave Qing Shui the evil eye and pulled Qing Shui back to reality again.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yueyue, since you don’t like that side of me. I won’t act any further. It is quite tiring.” Qing Shui walked over smiling and hugged Canghai Mingyue gently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, it was Canghai Mingyue’s turn to be dazed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without knowing what had happened, Canghai Mingyue was already in Qing Shui embrace. She could smell a light scent, and it was faint and special. It was not nasty-smelling but just natural.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was just a hug, yet Qing Shui could felt his heart racing. He could lose himself in that soft touch, and his heart was aroused as he looked at the slightly-powered extremely gorgeous face that was so close to his.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought unconsciously about the three Portraits of Beauty. When he first saw Canghai Mingyue, he felt that she had a different aura from Yiye Jiange but she was at that class of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was one of the women in the Portraits of Beauty. Logically, Canghai Mingyue should also be in one. From how the art maestro depicts the beautiful women on the Portraits of Beauty, he was capturing the top beauties of women with twelve different auras.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The portraits of beauty didn't simply emphasize the beauty of women’s external appearances. What they emphasized more was their charm and charisma, as well as that kind of otherworldly transcendence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui came out of his reverie, he found Canghai Mingyue wrapping her arms around his neck. It was so light. Her pair of eyes, so beautiful that they could overthrow empires, were staring deeply at his.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who has that sort of charm? Who could let young master Qing think of her while holding me?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could not tell the emotions behind Canghai Mingyue’s tone, but Qing Shui felt slightly anxious as they were spoken in his ears. His heart was beating very quickly. That sentence aroused him deeply, and he thought about the expression he had. Was it so obvious that he was thinking about women?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could that be a woman’s intuition?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Your young master Qing only thinks of you. Come, give your lord husband a kiss!” Qing Shui laughed as he plan to kiss on Canghai Mingyue on her lips.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You scoundrel.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue quickly turned her head but Qing Shui still managed to kiss her face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was soft and gentle….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, the hall doors swung open again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So both of you are actually having an intimate rendezvous here early in the morning. Why is everyone’s mood that good today.” Huoyun Liu-li, who was wearing a purple fox coat, came over while joking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-li, don’t talk nonsense!” Canghai Mingyue pushed away Qing Shui in a panic. Her face flushed red.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui. Big sister actually likes you a lot. You better not betray her.” Huoyun Liu-liu giggled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-li eyes sincerely, but Huoyun Liu-li kept shying away from his gaze. Qing Shui laughed and Canghai Mingyue followed. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You naughty lass, you always don’t say what you think, I will return him to you!” Canghai Mingyue pushed Huoyun Liu-li toward Qing Shui and left smiling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Woah.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui catched Huoyun Liu-li. He felt that this scene was famililar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the second time, previously it was the same...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li was as shy as an ostrich. She hid her face in Qing Shui’s chest, not daring to look up.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lifted Huoyun Liu-li’s delicate chin and looked at that coquettish woman. Her eyes shut tightly, revealing her thick lush and eyelashes that were slightly trembling.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had a sexy allure and a hidden sensuality.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw her petal-like pouty lips and slowly consumed them, pulling them in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li’s small figure trembled a little as she closed her eyes tighter!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui played with those petal-like lips, gentling sucking them and holding them. Then he smiled, “Everyone will be out later. Why don’t you come to my room tonight. I will let you do what you want with me.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li opened her limpid pair of smokey eyes. She looked at Qing Shui with an expression full of sexual desire and seduction. She blinked her eyes flirtatiously as she planted a kiss on Qing Shui’s face and turn to walk into the hall.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head with a sheepish smile. He shook away those thoughts and continued practicing his Taichi Fists before going back into the hall. The people from Lai residence had already prepared breakfast. Even though they were going to the Xiao residence today, the atmosphere was actually not that tense.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In just two days, Qing Shui realized that Qingqing had changed a lot. Even though Qing Shui had yet to see Qingqing smile, her expression had mellowed and she even initiated short conversations with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big sister, we will be going to Xiao residence and after that we can go home!”</p>

If it was in Great Perfection Stage, it would be 30 million jin. Unfortunately, it was only limited to the force of his stomp. If he were to step on someone’s body with that….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that Mighty Elephant Stomp might not be an easy technique to master.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued reading.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Crossing Waters!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only scanned for the names of the technique and skipped past the descriptions, as he did not have the time now to slowly polish and understand them. Qing Shui had already decided to try Mighty Elephant Stomp, but out of curiosity, he skimmed over the other techniques.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He saw that there were many pictures. What appeared most frequently in the pictures were gigantic, intimidating elephants. Their entire bodies seemed to be sculpted out of golden corundum; their massive bodies were incomparably tough and they did not have a hint of clumsiness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the pictures, some of the massive golden elephants were trumpeting towards the sky, and from the display of their aura, they seemed to be capable of tearing the skies apart. Some of the pictures also showed the crumbling and torn up ground after the stomps. The strength that tore the ground apart also left many creatures split opened...&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was then followed by a series of pictures that showed battles of these gigantic elephants. There were monstrous bears the size of small mountains and flying beasts in the air. There were gigantic blue pythons with circumferences like that of water jars, and there was even a giant python with evolved horns, or would they be more appropriately called Jiao….?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These were all defeated by the Golden Gigantic Elephants.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui browsed quickly. There were also serene pictures like the Golden Gigantic Elephants resting on the ground….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the most unbelievable image was that of the Golden Gigantic Elephants, not flying, but walking nimbly on the surface of a vast body of water. This was Mighty Elephant Crossing Waters….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly closed his eyes to experience the huge impact the pictures had on him. The imageries in the pictures seemed to flow right in front of Qing Shui. He felt the destruction, the force, the stirring magnificence of their aura. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui opened his eyes again, more than two hours have passed. These images did not enhance Qing Shui’s abilities, but in the two hours, Qing Shui’s visualization of it had changed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was certain that the prowess of the Golden Gigantic Elephant was definitely not lower than that of Martial Saint Level. He felt as if he had personally witnessed a battle between Martial Saint Level beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For many martial artists, it was an extravagant hope to see a battle between Marital Saint Level warriors. Naturally, a battle between Martial Saint Level beasts was so much more rare.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui’s state of mind had calmed down, he went back to studying the specifics of the cultivation techniques for the Mighty Elephant Stomp.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp was a type of “Diamond Qi”. If he could successfully cultivate Diamond Qi, it would be considered as a Small Stage Success. Gaining the ability to fuse that and the cultivators Qi’s essence would be at Large Success Stage. Finally, the Great Perfection Stage would be when there was a total fusion of the two.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was uncertain about his thoughts regarding that introduction. He felt particularly happy because he had a feeling that there was a special connection between “Diamond Qi” and his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The channelling route of Diamond Qi involved the four limbs, the back, and the abdomen; it was found almost throughout the body. Qing Shui was impressed. No wonder it was called “Diamond Qi”.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He bent slightly, almost in an horse stance. Qing Shui shut his eyes and followed the steps in Diamond Qi to slowly channel his Qi without using his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He slowly took in a breath and guided his Qi through the channelling routes in his body as per guided by Diamond Qi.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As time slipped away, Qing Shui could not feel any sense of change in his vital energy. He knew that channelling the elephant form would not be as easy as the other beasts, since the elephant form was so demanding. Success wouldn’t be easy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He stopped and thought for a while. Then, he continued practicing, yet he kept failing time after time. After many failures, Qing Shui had become accustomed to it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The following day, Qing Shui woke up very early. He cleaned up quickly and went to the small courtyard. Facing the east direction, he unhurriedly practiced his Taichi Fists and boosted his Nature Energy slightly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;After he finished, Qing Shui saw the door to the hall opening. Canghai Mingyue came out a gave Qing Shui a gentle smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; “You’re awake.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; Qing Shui laughed as he shook away the daze from admiring her beauty. Canghai Mingyue laughed lightly as she saw his slightly flustered expression.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui had left the Heavenly Palace, he had not seen Canghai Mingyue for almost half a year. Time was such a scary thing. Previously, Qing Shui could bravely kiss her, and later, he was able to hug and even tease her a few times.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Now, Qing Shui felt that the feelings he had for her faded, leaving only faint traces and memories.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After answering him, As Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui, she started laughing even louder, so much so that her laughing fit confused Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Am I that funny?” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue quizzically.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have never seen this side of you. It is cute. You look just a shy guy…” Canghai Mingyue explained as she blinked her dark, deep, and beautiful eyes adorably.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing her actions, Qing Shui knew that she must have learnt it unconsciously from Huoyun Liu-li. The thing was that, when such a ravishing beauty as herself does these slightly cute, these slightly enticing little antics, the “lethality” was even higher than those by the lovely cute types of women.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing Qing Shui look at her again with that foolish daze, Canghai Mingyue gave Qing Shui the evil eye and pulled Qing Shui back to reality again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yueyue, since you don’t like that side of me. I won’t act any further. It is quite tiring.” Qing Shui walked over smiling and hugged Canghai Mingyue gently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, it was Canghai Mingyue’s turn to be dazed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without knowing what had happened, Canghai Mingyue was already in Qing Shui embrace. She could smell a light scent, and it was faint and special. It was not nasty-smelling but just natural.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was just a hug, yet Qing Shui could felt his heart racing. He could lose himself in that soft touch, and his heart was aroused as he looked at the slightly-powered extremely gorgeous face that was so close to his.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought unconsciously about the three Portraits of Beauty. When he first saw Canghai Mingyue, he felt that she had a different aura from Yiye Jiange but she was at that class of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was one of the women in the Portraits of Beauty. Logically, Canghai Mingyue should also be in one. From how the art maestro depicts the beautiful women on the Portraits of Beauty, he was capturing the top beauties of women with twelve different auras.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The portraits of beauty didn't simply emphasize the beauty of women’s external appearances. What they emphasized more was their charm and charisma, as well as that kind of otherworldly transcendence.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui came out of his reverie, he found Canghai Mingyue wrapping her arms around his neck. It was so light. Her pair of eyes, so beautiful that they could overthrow empires, were staring deeply at his.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who has that sort of charm? Who could let young master Qing think of her while holding me?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could not tell the emotions behind Canghai Mingyue’s tone, but Qing Shui felt slightly anxious as they were spoken in his ears. His heart was beating very quickly. That sentence aroused him deeply, and he thought about the expression he had. Was it so obvious that he was thinking about women?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Could that be a woman’s intuition?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Your young master Qing only thinks of you. Come, give your lord husband a kiss!” Qing Shui laughed as he plan to kiss on Canghai Mingyue on her lips.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You scoundrel.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue quickly turned her head but Qing Shui still managed to kiss her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was soft and gentle….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, the hall doors swung open again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So both of you are actually having an intimate rendezvous here early in the morning. Why is everyone’s mood that good today.” Huoyun Liu-li, who was wearing a purple fox coat, came over while joking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-li, don’t talk nonsense!” Canghai Mingyue pushed away Qing Shui in a panic. Her face flushed red.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui. Big sister actually likes you a lot. You better not betray her.” Huoyun Liu-liu giggled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-li eyes sincerely, but Huoyun Liu-li kept shying away from his gaze. Qing Shui laughed and Canghai Mingyue followed. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You naughty lass, you always don’t say what you think, I will return him to you!” Canghai Mingyue pushed Huoyun Liu-li toward Qing Shui and left smiling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Woah.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui catched Huoyun Liu-li. He felt that this scene was famililar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the second time, previously it was the same...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li was as shy as an ostrich. She hid her face in Qing Shui’s chest, not daring to look up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lifted Huoyun Liu-li’s delicate chin and looked at that coquettish woman. Her eyes shut tightly, revealing her thick lush and eyelashes that were slightly trembling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had a sexy allure and a hidden sensuality.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw her petal-like pouty lips and slowly consumed them, pulling them in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li’s small figure trembled a little as she closed her eyes tighter!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui played with those petal-like lips, gentling sucking them and holding them. Then he smiled, “Everyone will be out later. Why don’t you come to my room tonight. I will let you do what you want with me.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li opened her limpid pair of smokey eyes. She looked at Qing Shui with an expression full of sexual desire and seduction. She blinked her eyes flirtatiously as she planted a kiss on Qing Shui’s face and turn to walk into the hall.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head with a sheepish smile. He shook away those thoughts and continued practicing his Taichi Fists before going back into the hall. The people from Lai residence had already prepared breakfast. Even though they were going to the Xiao residence today, the atmosphere was actually not that tense.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In just two days, Qing Shui realized that Qingqing had changed a lot. Even though Qing Shui had yet to see Qingqing smile, her expression had mellowed and she even initiated short conversations with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big sister, we will be going to Xiao residence and after that we can go home!”</p>
