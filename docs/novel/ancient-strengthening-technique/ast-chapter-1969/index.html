 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. The increase in strength wasn’t the one that surprised him. After all, this effect was somehow normal with the Opportunity Pills. Quite a few people from the Qing Clan also managed to boost their strength with the help of the Opportunity Pills. However, it was out of his expectations that the Five Elements Divine Flag reached its eighth grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had even forgotten its grade prior to this. This time, it should have broken through at least 2 grades. Also, after the upgrade, instead of eight, ten checkpoints could now be set in the map of the Five Elements Divine Flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui was speaking, he entered the Five Elemental Space and looked at the map of the Nine Continents. As usual, there was still no edges in the map. Towards the edge, the areas became very fuzzy. However, with Qing Shui at his current state, he was able to tell how vast the areas were. There were also the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain, it was at one of the edges that looked very blurry. Together with Haohan Continent, they were like two enormous dragons that were lined up side by side with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui realized that by now, there were still four locations which he could mark in the map. He then proceeded to look around the area. Without any hesitations, he immediately set up one of the marks at the deepest part of Haohan Continent. It was not literally the deepest part of the continent but still counted towards the deeper part of it. This location was compulsory to him. It was like a checkpoint, just like the Divine Cave where he was currently at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were three more marks which he could set up. Qing Shui thought for a while and noticed that for now, there were no suitable places where he could set the marks at. He decided that he would set them later on when he found suitable places for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Qing Shui was happy about was that he could bring along everything that were one hundred square meters around him. This meant that both its length and width were worth about thirty meters each. Qing Shui could have brought the entire clan together with him. Hence, if it was necessary, Qing Shui could bring his clan to Haohan Continent. It would also be very convenient for him if he wanted to bring them along to his old home, the Village of the Qing Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, Qing Shui planned to leave right away, but now that he still had some Opportunity Pills left with him, he decided to settle for Linhai City first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Qing Shui left the Qing Clan, he refined a few Opportunity Pills. Yuan Su once again gave him quite a few medicinal herbs required to make the Opportunity Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong, Lan Lingfeng and the others were naturally happy to see Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are for you. What you can get from it will depend on your luck. It won’t be long until I leave once again.” Qing Shui immediately took out a few Opportunity Pills and gave each of them one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah! No matter what! It’s a must that you stay here for a night!” Lan Lingfeng said hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our Young Master Qing still has to head off for the Sunset Seaking Palace. He won’t have anyone to share a blanket with him staying here.” Zi Checha chuckled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng responded with an “Oh”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. Ling Fei stood at the side. She only looked at them and smiled. All along, she had been a quiet person. Now that she had a son, she had become even more composed than before. This made her look a bit less charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, what surprised Qing Shui was that both Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong actually managed to break through to the mid-stage Seventh level of Divinity with only one Opportunity Pill. Qing Shui was dumbfounded by it. But since it was called the Opportunity Pill, this was already within his expectation. Besides, they were both Battle God Inheritors after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong were stunned. Nothing could describe this better than the phrase “reaching heaven in a single bound”. Thus, the increase in strength they received this time was still considered a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, the two were still very surprised by what it. The Seventh Divine Grade was a key-step in one’s cultivation. Going from the Sixth to the Seventh Divine Grade was the toughest process in one’s cultivation. Countless prodigies and genius warriors had their cultivations halted in front of the doorstep of the Seventh Divine Grade. Additionally, the gap between the Sixth and Seventh Divine Grade were also something which couldn’t be made up by mere numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others had also managed to increase quite a lot of their strength, but when compared to Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong, they came a little short.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui reminded them that they would have to spend the next half a year or even one year to stabilize their current realms. Before he managed to finish his sentence however, thunders already started accumulating in the sky. The Divine Tribulation was here…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, it was undeniable that Qing Shui was a bit worried. Nevertheless, the two still managed to make it through smoothly. By the end of it, they looked really exhausted. If there had been two more waves, it would have been a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without realizing it, half a day passed. Qing Shui bid his farewell to the gang and immediately proceeded to Sunset Seaking Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunset Seaking Palace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye was now already three months pregnant. However, from the outside, it didn’t seem obvious that she was pregnant. When the girls saw Qing Shui, they inquired him about the things going on back at home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It went on until noon and Qing Shui let them fed on the Opportunity Pills. Qing Shui was aware that he wouldn’t be able to leave today. With that being the case, he decided to stay here for a few days before setting off for the Vampiric Demoness Hill. It had been a long time since he last visited. He couldn’t help but wonder if the Vampiric tribe was doing good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed the girls all had decent luck. However, the one who benefited the most from it was Muyun Qingge. This caused Qing Shui to feel very upset as he thought about both Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong. Could it be because they were the Battle God Inheritors? Other than that was Tantai Lingyan. If he was only taking account of the amount of increased strength, Tantai Lingyan could be said to be the one who had received the largest boost. Her offensive prowess immediately went up to be almost Qing Shui’s equal. This meant that she had barely stepped into the late-stage of the Seventh Level of Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Muyun Qingge was at the mid-stage of the Seventh level of Divinity. At the same time, she also triggered her Divine Tribulations. Despite being underseas, it seemed as if the Divine Tribulations could happen anywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all of these were done, the sky was almost dark. Everyone chit-chatted with each other for a while. Qing Shui was the only man there and he was surrounded by multiple beauties around him. However, the people who truly managed to have relationships with him were Yiye Jiange and Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than the first time which was an accident, Tantai Lingyan hadn’t done much with Qing Shui. Hence, strictly speaking, for now, she couldn’t be considered as Qing Shui’s woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had tried to seduce her multiple times. He wanted to let her feel the ecstasy. However, he always failed to take the final step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, we intend to move the Sunset Seaking Palace to a place located deeper within the Northern Ocean.” Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui started thinking about it. Deep within the Northern Ocean… It was said that the deepest part of the ocean was linked to the Nine Continents Stars Ocean Domain. Hence, he knitted his brows and said, “For the time being, it’s better if you don’t make any moves. If you truly feel like migrating, don’t move too far away from here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, do you think it will be a better idea if we move to the Sacred Ocean first?” Yiye Jiange asked after giving it some thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. The Sacred Ocean, Sacred Mountain and then the Vampiric Demoness Hills… He rubbed his head and asked, “Why are we moving there?”</span></p>

Furthermore, we also share a good relationship with each other.” Yiye Jiange revealed an even more joyful expression than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the extremely pure woman and said, “Woman, you better spill the beans or else don’t blame me for using the family’s punishment against you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, she understood what he meant by the ‘family’s punishment’. It was merely spanking her butt.</span></p>

Nevertheless, the tone which she used to speak made Qing Shui feel numb. For a woman like her to speak like this, it was indeed like a test of willpower to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a bit worried that a conflict might break out between them and the Vampiric Empress, but very quickly, he thought about Sheng Jun and felt that everything should work out just fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, little Qing Xuan looks very beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed an awkward smile. He didn’t know how to respond to her. It seemed all of them had found out about it. In fact, Qing Shui never intended to hide it from them, however, things just happened too suddenly at that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange went forward and embraced Qing Shui’s neck, “Alright, I only happened to hear about it from Sheng Jun. I didn’t really mean anything with my words. My dearest husband, please don’t get angry at me for that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This might be her first time talking like that. She didn’t sound smooth when she was saying it. However, the more she acted this way, the more emotionally stirred Qing Shui got. It was a kind of spiritual impact which words couldn’t describe. It felt the same as hearing an extreme beauty confessing to him. The impact he received from it was just too huge. It was no wonder that some people enjoyed listening to some sweet stuffs or maybe on certain occasions, vulgar languages when making love. It was a kind of emotional impact, let alone when it was from a beauty like this who was capable of toppling over cities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui embraced her. When he saw the faint blush on her face, he already knew that she was feeling very shy. Nevertheless, she still said it out. Seeing this, he felt even more emotionally affected by her. He immediately moved his head forward and kissed those sexy lips of hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

The migration wasn’t something which could be done in a day or two. Although the Sacred Ocean might contain abundant Spiritual Qi, that wasn’t the main intention. They hoped that the Vampiric Empress could have someone to keep her company. This was very likely Yiye Jiange and the girls’ true intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t care less about these. With their current strength, as long as they didn’t enter the deepest part of the Northern Ocean, everything should be fine.</span></p>
