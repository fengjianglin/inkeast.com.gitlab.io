  <p><strong>AST 0147 – Completion of the Small Revitalizing Pill</strong></p>
  <p>“Wushuang, that was an accident. She is my woman now, and I do not wish for her to marry into Situ Clan under such a situation!” Qing Shui said bitterly!</p>
  <p>“Alright, let’s not mention it. I came here so that I could help you in case you were in trouble. That person earlier is from Situ Clan!”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wushuang’s word made Qing Shui even more firm that the person was indeed the expert from Situ Clan, and he was glad that he had managed to sneak in his hidden move. When the time comes, he would eliminate that old fart.</p>
  <p>“Alright, since you’re fine, I will be leaving!” Wenren Wushuang smiled, and turned to leave!</p>
  <p>“Wushuang!”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wushuang stopped in her tracks as she turned to look at Qing Shui, with still that light smile in her eyes. But to Qing Shui, that smile would only make him feel increasingly bitter.</p>
  <p>“Thank you!” He eventually spew out these three words with much difficulty!</p>
  <p>Wenren Wushuang smiled and left. Qing Shui heart gradually sunk together with Wenren Wushuang’s departure, knowing that the two of them may only remain as friends in the future. While he had expected such a reply, it still felt bitter when the truth sank in. He recalled the memories he had shared with Wenren Wushuang, the first time he saw her breathtaking beauty; the charming scene when he treated her; and the flirtatious moment they shared in the Golden-Ringed Valley a few days back. Qing Shui even thought that this unparalleled beauty really did like him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stood there in a daze. He knew that if he was to marry Shi Qingzhuang, he would lose Wenren Wushuang. It was not that he did not wish to be two-timing, but that he felt that she was not deserving of that. It would be an insult to them!</p>
  <p>Wenren Wushuang was an unparalleled beauty, and to top it off, she was also a Xiantian cultivator. Even if she were to look for a man, she would look for the best. Such a woman would not easily share a man with other women.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not have the heart to remain in the Martial Clinic. He decided to close up for the day and head back, but he met Qing Lang!</p>
  <p>“I have helped you to gather the things that you asked for!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned as he recalled that he had asked Qing Lang to gather the ingredients required to refine the Small Revitalizing Pill, with the exception of the thousand year old ginseng as for the ingredients required for the Five Dragon Pellet, Qing Shui had no plans yet. Amongst them, was an ingredient by the name of “Moonlight Grass” which must be used within a hour after plucking it. In addition, the “Moonlight Grass” exists in the Central Continent. Therefore, there is no way to refine it for now. But, he had slowly gathered and grown the required medicinal herbs in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Once he got his hands on the “Moonlight Grass”, he would be able to start the refining process immediately!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui received a big package from Qing Lang. “Qing Lang, thanks for going to the trouble!”</p>
  <p>“It’s something I should help with!”</p>
  <p>Qing Yu was very satisfied with Qing Lang, and once he placed his trust in a person, he would not change his stance. He thought of what had happened previously. Many people had stayed away from Qing Clan, and he himself had wanted Qing Lang and company to leave too. But, not only did they provide him with information, they did not avoid contact with him. While their powers were limited, it was very heartwarming.</p>
  <p>After Qing Lang had left, Qing Shui took out the many boxes inside, opening them one after another. Seahorse, one hundred year old King Cotton Snake, Amethyst, Camellia, Railway Beggarticks Herb, Epimedium, Vinca, Cherokee Rose, one hundred year old Deer Antler, and the innards of a three hundred year old Dinodon Rufozonatum!</p>
  <p>The medicinal herbs from his memory appeared in front of his eyes one after another, and the quality of them were all quite good. Qing Shui was not concerned about the price, and thus he had gotten medicinal herbs which were all a hundred years old or above. After all, the herbs in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were still quite young!</p>
  <p>“Haha! I can finally refine the Small Revitalizing Pill!” Qing Shui let out a satisfied laughter!</p>
  <p>Recalling that the Small Revitalizing Pill would increase one’s overall abilities by 10%, Qing Shui felt excited. He already had a monstrous strength of no less than 250,000 jin. 10% of that would be equivalent to a strength increase of 25,000 jin. Moreover, a person could take two of the Small Revitalizing Pill, and that would give him an additional strength of over 50,000 jin, allowing him to break through, and get a monstrous strength of 300,000 jin.</p>
  <p>At the same time, it would also increase one’s speed, endurance, defense, vitality…all of these areas will improve by 10%. After taking 2, the speed would be similar to reaching a certain level of training of the Deer Cantering. It was just too bad that each person could only take 2, otherwise if he were to keep taking the Small Revitalizing Pill…</p>
  <p>After pushing back the “perverse” thoughts, he stored the ingredients back into their boxes carefully, and left them in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Afterwards, he closed up the Martial Clinic, and went back to the Qing Clan. When he recalled the scene with Wenren Wushuang, he felt a sense of pressure and helplessness. When would he be able to reach the state of passing by a field of flowers, but having not a blade of leaf on himself?</p>
  <p>“Why is it that when other people pass through to a different time or dimension, even if they were to have many wives and concubines, they would all live in harmony, and even help the main character keep a lookout for beauties. Why don’t I have that kind of bastard’s luck…? Why is it that when it comes to me, the words just don’t come out from my mouth? Do I lack the confidence? Or is it abilities? Or do I not understand women’s hearts?” Qing Shui thought about it gloomily.</p>
  <p>After dinner, Qing Shui played with the little girl for a while before rushing upstairs, informing the others not to disturb him before he left!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s mind were fully occupied by the thoughts of the Small Revitalizing Pill, while being glad that he had broken through to the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, and that his abilities had been blown sky high. If he had refined the Small Revitalizing Pill before he had broken through the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, then he would not able to control the increase in abilities after taking the pill compared to what he could achieve now. It would be a complete waste of a precious item!</p>
  <p>Locking the door tightly after entering his room, Qing Shui quickly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p>Calming his mind, cleaning the medicinal herbs, harvesting them and putting aside the proportions needed…</p>
  <p>After completing the preparation, Qing Shui began circulating the 62 cycles of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. After having been through a long period of tough training, the golden drop the size of a soybean in his Dantian had increased to the size of a peanut! He could feel an obvious increase in his abilities!</p>
  <p>What made Qing Shui the happiest was that the thousand year old ginseng could be used two times. This meant that Qing Shui could refine the Small Revitalizing Pill two times. Furthermore, with the unique trait of the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, the success rate was very high!</p>
  <p>After adding in the correct proportions of medicinal herbs into the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, the primordial flames roared and Qing Shui shut his eyes, utilizing his spiritual sense to feel the changes within the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron as he controlled the degree of the flames!</p>
  <p>The grey-colored primordial flames gradually burned fiercer, and a bubbling sound came from within the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. Qing Shui kept his eyes shut as if he was a meditating monk without worldly possessions!</p>
  <p>In the middle, he added a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle which he had prepared earlier. When he was preparing earlier, Qing Shui was astonished when he gathered a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle. This was because the blood of the Golden Medicinal Turtle was also golden in color, and was rich as if it had the thickness of a paste!</p>
  <p>As time gradually passed, the flames remained burning fiercely, and only gradually decreased after being sustained for about 6 hours!</p>
  <p>The flames gradually decreased until they were below an inch high, and were sustained at that level for about three more days!</p>
  <p>After not eating or drinking anything for three days, Qing Shui quietly opened his eyes. His bright eyes flashed, and were soon replaced with a strand of joy. “Damn, if I had not broken through to the 4th level of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, there’s no way that I would have been able to sustain and refine this Small Revitalizing Pill!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that everything that he knew was all tied in with the Ancient Strengthening Technique. After keeping it in for a while, Qing Shui could not wait any longer and opened the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron!</p>
  <p>An immense medicinal fragrance floated out, causing the minds of those who had smelled it to be in a drunken stupor!</p>
  <p>There were six completely golden-colored Small Revitalizing Pellets, each the size of a peanut!</p>
  <p>“Hahaha!” Qing Shui could not hold it in and laughed out loud!</p>

 <p>The grey-colored primordial flames gradually burned fiercer, and a bubbling sound came from within the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. Qing Shui kept his eyes shut as if he was a meditating monk without worldly possessions!</p>
 <p>In the middle, he added a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle which he had prepared earlier. When he was preparing earlier, Qing Shui was astonished when he gathered a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle. This was because the blood of the Golden Medicinal Turtle was also golden in color, and was rich as if it had the thickness of a paste!</p>
 <p>As time gradually passed, the flames remained burning fiercely, and only gradually decreased after being sustained for about 6 hours!</p>
 <p>The flames gradually decreased until they were below an inch high, and were sustained at that level for about three more days!</p>
 <p>After not eating or drinking anything for three days, Qing Shui quietly opened his eyes. His bright eyes flashed, and were soon replaced with a strand of joy. “Damn, if I had not broken through to the 4th level of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, there’s no way that I would have been able to sustain and refine this Small Revitalizing Pill!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that everything that he knew was all tied in with the Ancient Strengthening Technique. After keeping it in for a while, Qing Shui could not wait any longer and opened the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron!</p>
 <p>An immense medicinal fragrance floated out, causing the minds of those who had smelled it to be in a drunken stupor!</p>
 <p>There were six completely golden-colored Small Revitalizing Pellets, each the size of a peanut!</p>
 <p>“Hahaha!” Qing Shui could not hold it in and laughed out loud!</p>
