 <p><strong>AST 1251 - Before The Battle, Accepting The Challenge</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected for someone to come and challenge him as soon as he broke through. Was this a coincidence or a scheme? However, he was still really happy. Before he left, he was still worrying about how he should make fame for himself. This was almost like someone giving you a pillow when you want to nap.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui didn’t understand why they wanted to unite and challenged him? Could it be that he was really close with the Eldest Princess last time? Or was it that he was really close with the higher-ups in the Heaven Secrets Academy and that his name as the Guest Custodian had been spread?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart was moved as soon as he saw the Saint Child’s name. It might be that he felt that he had been careless last time and he wanted to fight again. Or, it might be that the challenge this time wasn’t suggested by the Saint Child. This was just pushing somebody to do something way beyond their ability. For example, if Qing Shui got beaten by the Lord Sect or by other people, wouldn’t that in a way say that he himself was inferior to them?</p>
 <p>In just a moment, Qing Shui’s thoughts spun about in his head quickly. Different ideas constantly flashed across his mind, but he wasn’t worried for now. However, he also didn’t want to offend all of them at once. Even though he wasn’t scared of them, there were still the Eldest Princess, Qing Sha and others here.</p>
 <p>When someone loved their house, they would love their crows too. (chinese idiom) Similarly, when someone hated it, they would also hate the crows together. Hence, if one of them were insane, who could guarantee nothing would happen? If he really wanted to fight, he would have to make sure to smash them completely and make sure that they couldn’t stand back up forever.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui was indulged in his thoughts, Tian Jiange came. Compared to before, he seemed to be a lot more calm and steady. However, his brows were slightly knitted at the moment. As he saw the challenge letter in Qing Shui’s hand, he said helplessly: “This was elder brother’s wish. I couldn’t stop him.”</p>
 <p>“Why stop him? Are you confident in taking over the Lord Sect?” Qing Shui suddenly asked Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>“I don’t understand?” Tian Jiange seemed panicked. He stared at Qing Shui very tightly.</p>
 <p>“I’m saying, if your brother lose the match this time and that you end up taking over the Lord Sect, will you be able to control it?” Qing Shui pinned the challenge letter on the stone table.</p>
 <p>“Brother, my current strength is still insufficient to control the Lord Sect.” Tian Jiange let out a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Don’t rush. We will wait a bit longer then.” QIng Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange felt that the current Qing Shui was a bit unpredictable. He didn’t know what exactly he should say. Even though he could roughly guess it, he couldn’t really believe it either. This time, a few people had united to challenge him. A lot of people could tell that the Saint Child had been careless last time. Hence, if Qing Shui accepted this challenge, things definitely wouldn’t end well for him.</p>
 <p>“Elder brother, please help me pass the message. Just tell them that I accept the challenge, but we will need to bet on something by then.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Brother, even if you don’t accept it, the outsiders won’t say anything. Why don’t you reject it?” Tian Jiange tried to convince him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. Just help me pass the message to them. As long as they promise that, I will accept the challenge. By then, the conditions of the bet will satisfy both sides. Tell them to not worry about it.” Qing Shui smiled. This time, he had considered to helped the Eldest Princess paved ways.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange stopped convincing him. He knew that Qing Shui normally wouldn’t change his minds on things which he had decided on. Besides, from the way he knew this man, he knew that Qing Shui wouldn’t do things he wasn’t confident with.</p>
 <p>When he first came, he had already noticed that Qing Shui felt different than before. Even though he wasn’t really sure, but it must have a huge relation with the breakthrough in his strength.</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow noon at the Heaven Secrets Arena!” Qing Shui confirmed the time as he smiled and told Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui accepted the challenge. He once again spread it around the Heaven Secret Academy.</p>
 <p>People were already talking about all kinds of things after just a while. Now, no one dared to look down on Qing Shui anymore. In any case, how many people were there that could force the Saint Child to the extent that he united with other people to challenge someone? Furthermore, Qing Shui also held the position as the Guest Custodian.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Brother Sui, are you still going to spectate it this time?” The old man with surname Cao chuckled as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Do you think that it’s still something to look forward to?”</p>
 <p>“Most likely not, the gap is too wide.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, by the way nurture that little lass well. In the future, the Heaven Secrets Academy will be in her hand. It’s only by her ruling that the Heaven Secrets Academy will be the strongest existence within the Western Oxhe Continent. The Heaven Secrets Academy may be able to spread out its force across the entire continent earlier than expected. It may even have hope of making its way into the other three continents. This is an opportunity.”</p>
 <p>“You are saying that the brat likes Sunu?” The old man with surname Cao asked in a slightly strange manner.</p>
 <p>“Haha, is this even something to be questioned about? Just watch, in the future, Sunu will definitely get together with this brat.” The old man in gold dragon gown said while he laughed.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“You’ve changed!” the Eldest Princess got shocked after she saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I look more handsome now, don’t I?” Qing Shui quickly went with the flow and said.</p>
 <p>“You have become even paler. Your skin also looks smoother. You look a bit like a girl now.” the Eldest Princess said seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt black lines hang above his head. He angrily clenched his teeth and hugged her: “Do I seem more manly now……?”</p>
 <p>“Pu!”</p>
 <p>As she saw Qing Shui’s face, the Eldest Princess laughed. She softly opened up his arms, let out her hand and rubbed his head. She only stopped after she messed up his hair.</p>
 <p>“You are fighting again? Are you confident you can win?” the Eldest Princess turned around and went forward.</p>
 <p>“Have you ever seen me before doing something I’m not confident with?” Qing Shui said as he showed off.</p>
 <p>“Good then, inform me when you’re about to leave. I’ll send you off!” the Eldest Princess smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Going to miss me?” Qing Shui took two steps forward towards her.</p>
 <p>“Who do you think you are? I won’t even remember you.” the Eldest Princess smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Can I ask you a question?” Qing Shui asked strangely.</p>
 <p>“What question?” the Eldest Princess felt that Qing Shui’s expression looked a bit weird.</p>
 <p>“I have said before that everyone has emotions regardless of whether they are guys or girls. Have you ever thought of a man throughout these years? For example, have you ever had any wet dreams?” Qing Shui said patiently while he looked at the Eldest Princess. If the Eldest Princess’ expression changed very quickly, he would immediately stop.</p>
 <p>“What kind of answer do you want?” the Eldest Princess wasn’t mad, nor was she angry. It was as if she was emotionless. Instead, she asked back another question to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I want the real answer.”</p>
 <p>“Can you distinguish between the real and fake answer?”</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>“Well that explains it. What answer do you want to hear? I’ll answer you that, wouldn’t that be better?” The Eldest Princess responded with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“Yes, that makes sense too. Well then, you can say you have emotions. You have also had a lot of charming and gentle dreams before. In those dreams, you were having fun with Qing Shui and you almost died from the overwhelming pleasure after I fulfil your sexual desir……”</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui could finish his words, the shy Eldest Princess immediately covered his mouth.</p>
 <p>She also never expected this tactless little brat to become more and more daring. Qing Shui, whose mouth had been covered, already experienced this before. He let out his tongue and licked it around her palm. The Eldest Princess retracted back her hand as if she just got shocked.</p>
 <p>“You are not respecting me.” the Eldest Princess slightly lowered down her head and said depressingly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as if his heart stopped for a while. With both of his arms, he held her shoulders which felt like blades and said seriously: “No, I have always respected you. It’s just that for some reason, I really enjoyed looking at your shy face. I am treating you like my soulmate, a soulmate whom I can share everything with. Since you say that you are not getting married, I want to give you another kind of life.”</p>
 <p>As the Eldest Princess heard Qing Shui’s words, her beautiful body shook. She lifted up her head and looked at the serious expression of the man in front of him. Then, she smiled gently: “I am not getting married. If I were to do so, I’ll get married to you.”</p>
 <p>“Do you not mind about the fact I have wives anymore?” Qing Shui looked at the Eldest Princess, confused. Women’s thought were indeed unpredictable.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to stick around with you everyday. Besides, I am just saying if. Don’t try to come up with any crooked intentions or else I will ignore you for my entire life.” The Eldest Princess revealed a relaxed smile.</p>
 <p>“Crooked intention? What crooked intention?” QIng Shui asked as he pretended like he didn’t know what she meant.</p>
 <p>“Do not take off my cloth……” It seemed like the Eldest Princess also didn’t know how she should respond to make it sound appropriate. However, she knew that Qing Shui was only teasing her. Hence, she was also playing with him as she was also aware of the schemes of men.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I know now. So as long as I don’t take off your clothes, I can do whatever I want, right?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>It was as if the Eldest Princess also heard something wrong with what he said. “Little bastard, you are becoming more daring now!”</p>
 <p>“I’m about to engage in a fight with other people. Sister Su, please give me some motivation.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess was helpless. However, she still stepped forward and gently hugged Qing Shui. From what she said before, it could be already considered she have made a promise with Qing Shui. Hence, she didn’t feel that any of the close interactions they had with each other were repulsive. She realized that she didn’t really hate this kind of sensation but rather, it seemed that she even started to look forward to them.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui looked at her, he was a bit stunned. He gently kissed her jade-like face. It smelled really fragrant, felt really smooth and soft. He quickly separated away from her after he kissed her. Despite so, this still stunned the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>The impact was still really huge. After she looked at Qing Shui for quite a while, she dug her head into his chest. The two of them hugged each other very tightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt the firmness of her breast and wonderful softness of her body. He couldn’t resist the erection of his little brother. It pressed against a tender spot, causing the beautiful body in his arm to immediately weaken.</p>
 <p>He was aware which part of her body he had bumped into. Compared to himself, the Eldest Princess’ slender body wasn’t really that short. She had long and slender legs, as she also tiptoed back then when she hugged him. And now, the firm object below Qing Shui already pressed itself against her wet spot.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui inhaled some cold air. This was a kind of comfortable sensation. It has been a long time since he had last ‘eaten any flesh’. As he embraced that beautiful waist, he unknowingly exerted a bit of force. Qing Shui didn’t know when, but his hands were already on her upright and beautiful buttocks. As he touched it, it felt smooth like jade and also felt incredibly tight. Without himself noticing, he had already grabbed it.</p>
 <p>“If you try to do anything more than that, I will leave right away.”</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess’ weak and soft voice came through.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui wasn’t moving, the firm and upright object below him got stimulated. It felt as if it was moving up and down slightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s arms embraced her alluring butt. He lowered down his head and looked at the her blurry eyes. The Eldest Princess, whose entire face had turned red, was tightly embracing Qing Shui’s neck with both of her arms. She wanted to lift up her body a bit higher to avoid the interaction down below which made her flustered.</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t know that the higher she tried to lift up her body, the more awkward the angle looked. Even though she had her clothes on, he still had a really strong desire to make his way in. Right now, Qing Shui was feeling both comfortable down to his core, but was also feeling tortured. He was just like a person that was about to starve to death who saw a piece of fresh, cooked meat. However, the only thing he could do was to lick it, he couldn’t bite it or eat it.</p>
 <p>It had only been roughly about half an hour and the only thing Qing Shui felt was the woman in his arms being stiff. Following that, he felt something very wet below him. However, it didn’t really come from him. The woman in his arms on the other hand, was still twitching.</p>
 <p>She was actually this sensitive…...</p>
