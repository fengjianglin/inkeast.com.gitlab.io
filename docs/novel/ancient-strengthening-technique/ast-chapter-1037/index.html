 <p><strong>AST 1037 - Returned, Gaining Another Power Of 20 Stars</strong></p>
 <p>After meeting Yu Ruyan and receiving a stink-eye from her, Qing Shui rubbed his nose in an awkward fashion. However, when he took another glance at her, he noticed that she was actually smiling at him while she gave him a nod.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was confused by her gesture. She had already nodded her head when they first exchanged their greetings, but she gave him another nod to him yet again. Worst of all, he couldn't tell by her expression what her exact intention was.</p>
 <p>Then a thought popped into his mind. The expression Yu Ruyan gave him was a bit confusing, but he could sense an emotion of delight in her eyes. Surprised by his discovery, he turned to look at Duanmu Lingshuang, wondering if they were all on the same wavelength.</p>
 <p>This time, Duanmu Lingshuang was also nodding her head. He felt pleased to know what Duanmu Lingshuang had meant by her gesture, because she was actually encouraging him to pursue the matters between himself and her mother.</p>
 <p>When Duanmu Lingshuang and her husband arrived at the Duanmu Residence to greet Yu Ruyan, they had unintentionally seen Qing Shui embracing Yu Ruyan in his arms. That image was still as clear as day in their minds. Both Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan didn’t even have the chance to explain themselves, but it seemed unnecessary now that Duanmu Lingshuang was supportive of their relationship.</p>
 <p>“Thank you Miss Lingshuang!” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to thank me. I still have to thank you for helping us through and through. You have given us so much since the moment when we first met you.” Duanmu Lingshuang laughed cheerfully.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was speechless as she glanced towards Qing Shui. She wanted to ask him why he was thanking Lingshuang, but ultimately kept silent as she felt helpless towards his behavior.</p>
 <p>They went into the hall together, where the banquet in the living room was already prepared and set. This was a private banquet as there were only a few of them joining for a feast together.</p>
 <p>“Mother, are you sure you want to give the position of the head clan to Duanmu Zhen?” Duanmu Lingshuang allowed her child to roam around and play. A maidservant would be accompanying the young child to play and protect him from harm.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Although the members of the Duanmu Clan has nothing more to say, this is still the Duanmu Clan. Duanmu Zhen is more than capable of being the head clan. At long last, I can finally have a peace of mind.” Yu Ruyan said with a calm tone.</p>
 <p>“Even though they knew mother did everything for Duanmu Clan, they are still narrow-minded. I guess it’s fine to give them the power of the Duanmu Clan after all this time.” Duanmu Lingshuang said nonchalantly.</p>
 <p>Hu Yanlin wasn’t good at speaking with others, so he kept a benevolent smile on his face without delving into the family matters of Duanmu Clan. Qing Shui didn’t ask him about it, and Hu Yanlin wouldn’t make the effort to talk about it either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this wise man hidden behind the appearance of a fool. He lifted up his cup and clinked to Hu Yanlin’s before he gulped down his wine. Naturally, he was able to hear the conversation between Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang around the table.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan had already made up her mind, and because of Qing Shui, she was more than determined to give up her life in the Duanmu Clan. Some things would be better if she gives it up entirely.</p>
 <p>After they had dinner, the sky was already dimming to darkness. Hu Yanlin and his family left soon to their designated courtyard, but only after they had bid goodnight to Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan were the only ones left in the living room. The atmosphere became romantic all of the sudden.</p>
 <p>“Ruyan, where am I going to sleep?” Qing Shui asked with a grin.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan jolted for a moment before she quickly turned her gaze away and said: “I will escort you to your room!”</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Qing Shui wanted to say something, but he didn’t. He proceeded to follow Yu Ruyan and left the hall with her.</p>
 <p>They were now on their way to Yu Ruyan’s other courtyard. The atmosphere in this courtyard was peaceful and elegant. Qing Shui had no concept about large houses or rooms, and he had always preferred smaller yet cozier homes, especially his bedroom, where he would feel most comfortable if the room was snug and adequately sized.</p>
 <p>They hadn’t gone too far yet, and Qing Shui was already grabbing onto one of Yu Ruyan’s delicate hand. Even though the sky was a bit dark, he could still see the anxiousness in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Even though they had arrived at the courtyard, Yu Ruyan had no choice but to allow Qing Shui to continue holding her hand as they proceeded towards the front entrance of his room.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you can go in and rest here. Everything in this room is new. I’m tired, so I will go back to my room and rest.” Yu Ruyan didn’t enter and stopped to part her ways with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Elder sister, I see you’re quite exhausted. Why don’t you come in and let me give you a massage. My hand techniques are really good.” Qing Shui continued to hold her hand without the intention of letting her go.</p>
 <p>“Are you thinking of doing something naughty?” Yu Ruyan huffed in anger.</p>
 <p>“Eh, Am I that kind of men in your eyes? Hmm, what kind of naughty things were you talking about?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed. Yu Ruyan was immediately silenced by his boastful laughter.</p>
 <p>“Alright, fine. Kiss me and I’ll let you go. If not, I will take you inside and give you a massage.” said Qing Shui as he tightened his grip on Yu Ruyan’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you dare!” Yu Ruyan scowled at Qing Shui embarrassingly. She knew what his ‘massage’ really meant.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I see you’re doubting your husband’s ability.” said Qing Shui as he swept her off the ground and carried her into his room.</p>
 <p>Before Yu Ruyan could retaliate, they were already inside the living room.</p>
 <p>“I’ll kiss you, just put me down. What a rascal.” Yu Ruyan was already weak as she fumbled to regain her composure.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to force her excessively, so he put her down gently on a wooden sofa with her back against the armrest and her feet on his thighs.</p>
 <p>He revealed a smile as he inched his face closer to hers.</p>
 <p>His heart was throbbing faster as he anticipated a kiss from his wife.</p>
 <p>He could feel a soft sensation on his cheek. Her lips were moist and soft, and her sweet fragrance traveled to his nose when she closed in for a kiss.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui wouldn’t push his luck with Yu Ruyan, he would still try to push his luck a little. He allowed her to kiss, and she kissed him on the cheek. Their relationship was already established, so he decided to push forward to the next level.</p>
 <p>He slowly turned to face her and went in for a kiss on her seductive lips while she looked at him with nervous eyes.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan gave a little whimper and struggled to break loose, but Qing Shui was too domineering. She finally calmed down after a while and continued to kiss him for 15 minutes. When Yu Ruyan was about to lose her breath, Qing Shui stopped and let her out from his grasp.</p>
 <p>He smiled, because Yu Ruyan had finally responded to his love bashfully, even to the point where her tongue was teased into his mouth.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was too shy to look directly into Qing Shui’s eyes. Perhaps she felt pressured being with Qing Shui. Her age, her past marriage, and the fact that she already had a daughter who was already a grown woman…..</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to tease her initially, but when he saw her expression in that moment, he held her into his arms and asked: “What’s wrong? Why do you look so sad?”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you already know about my situation. I’m scared that you will get tired of me one day….”</p>
 <p>“Slap!”</p>
 <p>A distinct slap could be heard when he spanked her bulbous buttcheek. He didn’t use that much of a strength, but the sound was still audible.</p>
 <p>“What nonsense are you thinking again. I admit that I’m a scoundrel for courting you when I already have a few wives by my side. But I can tell you this earnestly: I have always loved all my women with my life and soul, and that includes you too. You are my woman and my life. Do you think I will throw away my life just like that?” Qing Shui looked at her misty eyes and said in a serious tone as he placed his fingers on her chin and angled to his line of sight.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Ruyan isn’t a woman to go through all that all over again.” said Yu Ruyan as she placed her hands on his cheeks.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I’m your man, so I will never let you suffer anymore. I won’t die so quick, because I don’t think I can part with a beautiful woman like you.”</p>
 <p>“You loudmouth!”</p>
 <p>“Ruyan, you should aim for Martial Emperor. That way, I can take you to the other four continents in the future.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words felt unreal to Yu Ruyan. She stopped for a while before shaking her head: “Martial Emperor? I don’t think I have a chance anymore.”</p>
 <p>“The bones of our Yu Ruyan are extraordinary, and you have a Divine Body with superior talents. You will become a Martial Emperor soon.”</p>
 <p>“Tch, I’m not yours, you know.” Yu Ruyan spat him a short reply. The rosy flush was still lingering on her cheeks.</p>
 <p>“Come, I will give you a massage.” As soon as Qing Shui was done talking, he grabbed one of her delicate feet and saw that it was covered in long white socks. His heart skipped a beat upon seeing the exquisitely sultry leg of hers.</p>
 <p>Even though he was just grabbing her foot, he could still sense the smoothness of her skin.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan let out a soft cry and tried to pull back her leg, but Qing Shui would never let her do that and took off her socks immediately. Her refreshing foot was delicately smooth and pale, and her toes were dainty and exquisite. Qing Shui began moving his hands and pressed firmly on the acupoints beneath her foot.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan went weak and numb while letting out a squeal uncontrollably. She quickly covered her mouth to stop her voices from coming out and subsequently lowered her head.</p>
 <p>No one could resist Qing Shui’s massage technique. It was a feeling of ecstasy that was quite comparable to his hand-to-hand combat technique, but less of the intensity in the visual senses and pounding force of his techniques.</p>
 <p>“Don’t hold back. You’ll feel better if you let out your voice.” Qing Shui smiled as he exerted more pressure on her foot and sped up his hand movements. The area with the largest number of acupoints would always be on the sole of the foot.</p>
 <p>A layer of sweat rolled down from Yu Ruyan’s forehead as her cheeks were flushed with intense red. Her misty eyes were filled with a subtle layer of tears as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried the weak limping woman and went towards the bedroom.</p>
 <p>This time, Yu Ruyan remained silent in his chest without lifting up her head. Both of her arms were already clinging to his neck as he continued to embrace her in his arms.</p>
 <p>This mature woman was surprisingly reserved when she laid on the bed. She has the poise of a mature lady, yet her expression and movements were that of a bashful woman. When both of them connected their bodies together, they let out a gasp of breath simultaneously and instinctively.</p>
 <p>He laid on the delicate body of the dignified woman after a sending her to a climax through his foreplay and began gently moving his body in a rhythmic grinding motion. He let his emotions overcame his body as he watched the embarrassed expression of the beautiful woman.</p>
 <p>“Ruyan, open your eyes!” Qing Shui whispered gently and planted a kiss on her soft tender lips.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan opened her eyes to reveal a misty gaze at Qing Shui. He couldn’t explain why, but he felt an excited throbbing in his chest, yearning to devour every part of her body in an instant.</p>
 <p>…….</p>
 <p>Perhaps they had been separated for too long after that one incident, Qing Shui was surprised to find her strength greatly boosted. Unexpectedly, his power was surged as well, gaining the amount of 20 stars overall. The energy flowed within his body felt quite pure too.</p>
 <p>The last accidental copulation with Yu Ruyan didn’t grant him a large amount of power because he was still quite weak back then. He gained a mediocre sum, unlike the amount accumulating to the strength of stars. Could the amount gained have anything to do with their current power?</p>
 <p>He pondered for a while and came up with the same conclusion. He then recalled his experiences with Shi Qingzhuang and Huoyun Liu-Li, and he knew his power boost was definitely related to their Divine Bodies, or in other words, he would need to copulate with a woman who would not be deemed as inferior to the women in the Portrait of Beauty in order to gain an exponential amount of strength to his power.</p>
 <p>The amount gained varied with each woman he had intimate interaction with, and Mu Qing was the one who had gained the largest amount of power among them all!</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was shocked as well. She didn’t expect she would gain an enormous amount of power after having sex with Qing Shui again. Last time was shocking enough, but this time was way out of her comprehension.</p>
 <p>“Are you satisfied?” Qing Shui continued to lock his body with hers as he asked Yu Ruyan gleefully.</p>
 <p>“Why did my powers surge that much?” Qing Shui didn’t reply and ignored her question as he continued to embrace Yu Ruyan tightly. Both of them were still wrapped together like a whole entity.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wouldn’t tell her about the Portrait of Beauty, of course. He only explained to her that her bones were extraordinarily compatible for martial cultivation.</p>
 <p>After an incessant amount of pressure from Qing Shui, Yu Ruyan couldn’t endure much longer and finally shouted ‘Husband’ with a weak voice. It was only then Qing Shui finally stopped and glanced at her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Ruyan, I will stay for a few days and help you become a Martial Emperor. I will go to the four continents to fight for a territory, then when you’re ready, I will come to welcome you personally.” Qing Shui said with a smile to Yu Ruyan.</p>
