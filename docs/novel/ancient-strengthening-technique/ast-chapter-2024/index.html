 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew it now, the main ability of the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider was to reduce the target’s speed, trap it and poison it. However, the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider had a scary strength currently. Moreover, it was fast. The Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider could easily kill the target once it was greatly weakened and unable to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At its present state, the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider had incredible defensive power and sharpness of claws. Besides, the demonic spiders around the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider had tremendous changes. They were largely experiencing the breakthrough, previously, they were suppressed by the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the demonic spiders were still eight-headed, a small golden dragon head appeared on each of them. Some of the dragon heads were silver-colored. Qing Shui felt that he owned many demonic beasts by just taming one Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider. Plus, he did not have to bother about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui asked the Dragon Spider to show its abilities in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He was more satisfied and pleased as he saw its performance. The Dragon Spider’s ability improved substantially. With that fact, his overall strength and output ability were greatly boosted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By owning the Dragon Spider, Qing Shui could use his multiple skills without worries. The Dragon Slaying Beast could also kill as it liked. If he had the Dragon Spider in the bottom of the lake, he should be able to fight against the monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, the Dragon Spider would never be so powerful if there was no accident at the bottom of the lake. Gains and losses were simultaneous, there were both opportunity and hazard. This time, the reward in exchange for the risk taken was definitely worthy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the dawn when Qing Shui came out from the realm. Qing Shui came out once halfway at night when the two women were resting. Then, Qing Shui entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal again. This time, the sun was already rising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a stroll at the spacious suburban area. The sky was full of stars, silver beams were shining like gems. It was pleasing to the eyes. The sky was very beautiful here at night. Qing Shui would be spellbound if he was not used to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could not spot the galaxy, the current world was unlike his previous world. On top of that, he had been here for several tens of years. He wondered how was the past life now, he made his home here, and everything about his past life was fading.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not want to return, needless to say, he wasn’t sure how to. Even if he could, he was already a totally different person despite having the same environment. He would feel absolutely lonely if he were there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The night breeze was a little chilly, but that only applied to the ordinary men. At the Xiantian level, he was already invulnerable to various weather conditions, let alone Qing Shui’s current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taichi fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had nothing to do. He found a distant place to practice his fists so that he would not affect the two resting women. He would persistently practice the Taichi fist daily. It was a fist technique that was physically quenching, foundation-stabilizing, and Origin Qi strengthening. The more Qing Shui practiced it, the more he sensed the magic of this fist technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun was rising up from the East, a thousand golden beams shone at the land and lightened up the surrounding objects. Everything seemed so lively and active now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui found the dishes were ready as he came back, the two women were waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, time to eat,” Yu Xixuan said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beiming Xue looked at Qing Shui, her smile was subtle and warm. She wanted to be close friends with Qing Shui like before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of his past life, it was nothing to have a kiss. A divorce was not surprising and it was normal to have sex. The Main Continent was similar to the past life, only the partner was the key. Some women were open like many women in his previous world. However, some other women took their integrities heavier than their own lives like the ancient women from the past. There were fewer women like these in his past life than in the current world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan noticed something fishy, she took a glance at Qing Shui and then Beiming Xue. She said, “Are you guys hiding anything from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” Beiming Xue said hastily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, there must be something, did you guys……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, we just……” Beiming Xue stopped talking. She was a newbie in this matter despite her intelligence. She avoided the topic once she heard Yu Xixuan’s words. Yet, she did not know that would further increase Yu Xixuan’s suspicion. The previous statement revealed that there was something between her and Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you do?” Yu Xixuan smirked, she was no longer anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, don’t bother about that, let’s eat,” Qing Shui replied instantly after seeing the awkwardness of Beiming Xue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Sister Xue is my good sister, you can’t treat me this way even if you are closer to Elder Sister Xue,” Yu Xixuan stared at Qing Shui in grief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui raised his hand, “Alright, my fault. Let’s eat, okay? Let’s eat……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Sister Xue, say it. I’m curious, what happened to you guys? Did he touch you over there?” Yu Xixuan sounded cunning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was not loud, but Qing Shui could hear her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nearly spurted out, this woman was a vixen, definitely a vixen. Surprisingly, this serious, alluring, and slightly arrogant woman said something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, stop making a silly guess. You only know how to talk nonsense. There is nothing between us, we only hugged each other when we were dragged into the water,” Beiming Xue glared at Yu Xixuan shyly and said in a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only that? Okay, let’s eat,” Yu Xixuan seemed disappointed, but she knew it was not that simple. Yet, she knew when to stop; otherwise, things would get ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the meal, three of them continued on their journey. This time, they headed back while looking for treasures. The Dragon Slaying Beast searched ceaselessly. The journey back was different from the previous route, but it was directed towards the spiritual land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Herbs and stones were abundant. Unfortunately, Qing Shui had yet to find the ingredients to forge the Flying Swords. He only lacked about two ingredients and thought he would find it this time. However, the hope was slim now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten days later, three of them arrived at the entrance of the spiritual land. As they were approaching, Qing Shui did not call upon his demonic beast. He planned to stay for a few days and leave this place. After all, there were only several days left until the entrance opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not see Lei Bao and Wang Zhong, but the men from the Bright Moon Palace were there. They did not expect Qing Shui and the two women to return, but they were not too surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Qing, how are your gains?” Qu Bai smiled, that sounded more like a greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s alright! What about yours?” Qing Shui smirked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui recalled when these people left. He held no sentiments for them at all, especially for the middle-aged man whose three-headed snake was dead. His eyes were glued to the two women as if he wanted to strip their clothes off.</span></p>
