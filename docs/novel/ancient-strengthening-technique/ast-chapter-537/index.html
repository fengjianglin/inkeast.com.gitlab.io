 <p><strong>Chapter 537 A Slaughter , The Insane Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 537 - A Slaughter , The Insane Diamond Gigantic Elephant</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Such terrifying speed……” Qing Shui stared blankly at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the Diamond Gigantic Elephant didn’t break through to the Martial Saint Grade, Qing Shui felt that it’s within his expectations. After all, it previously only managed to achieve the strength equivalent to an Eighth Grade Martial King. Although its strength still exceeded that of a human Eighth Grade Martial King, it was still restricted by the limitations of its cultivation grades. Its speed in particular. This had caused the strength of the Diamond Gigantic Beast to be restricted significantly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, after breaking through to the pinnacle of the Martial King Grade, its strength doubled and surpassed the Demonic Beasts with sharp ten countries worth of strength. At this rate, it would only have to break through one more time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The next time it broke through, it would be a Martial Saint Grade Demonic Beast. To both Demonic Beasts and human warriors, the Martial Saint Grade was an impassable abyss. Regarding the strength of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Qing Shui was already quite satisfied with it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In an instant, the Diamond Gigantic Beast had already charged into the crowds in the Demon Beast Sect. Due to the crowd being extremely concentrated in one area, almost half of the men from Demon Beast Sect straight away lost their ability to fight. A third of the people died on the spot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For the people who remained, there were also some of them who swung their weapons and struck towards the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. A loud clang resounded as the weapons collided with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's armor like hide. It made them felt particularly helpless. Their hearts felt as if they turned into dead ashes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A defensive strength of more than thirty countries was just too insane! Unless they performed a combined attack which was perfectly in sync, &nbsp;it would be futile even if they had more weapons. Their strengths were all scattered, it’s just like when a child hit an adult, the adult wouldn’t feel hurt. Even if there were more children hitting him, he would still feel nothing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With its current strength, it would be basically really hard for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to meet its match in the Green Cloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked on as the Diamond Gigantic Beast drove back and forth the crowd in the Demon Beast Sect like a phantom with its enormous body. Its gigantic body was as agile as an ape, it looked really smooth and violent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A golden light flashed. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant shot out a thread and created a golden afterimage. It was an indescribable feeling of power.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The shining Diamond Gigantic Elephant immediately charged towards the defenseless Demonic Beast Sect’s Supreme Leader.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Its tremendous strength immediately killed a few people on the spot. The smell of blood started to spread out through the air. The entire area was filled with an intractable pressure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In its breakthrough this time, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant once again gained new abilities.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw the previous attacks and speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he could already tell that it had awakened its battle techniques that probably stemmed from its ancestral memories.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, Qing Shui didn’t have the time to witness it because he was occupied with the things around him. There was still a Grand Elder left with a few formidable Demonic Beasts on his side.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the Demon Beast Sect hadn’t sent out all of their troops, they had already used up almost half of their strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, Green Cloud Continent is about to undergo a significant change. Hehe, who would have thought that he would be the one to trigger it?” Hai Dongqing smiled at the man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Dongqing, tell me, is this a good thing or a bad thing?” The man knitted his brows and asked as he glanced towards the short yet chivalrous young man standing afar.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Whether it’s good or bad, it doesn’t matter. Among the nine, the Green Cloud Continent has akways been the weakest continent for so many years. I feel that this might be a chance for it to change, everything might change because of him.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If the Heavenly Palace were to rise……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m also just making a guess. But it is really rare to see someone who is as talented and stunning as him. In the future, he alone will be enough to cause chaos across the World of the Nine Continents.” Hai Dongqing smile faintly as she looked at Qing Shui from behind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is the first time you have complimented someone to this extent. For someone who can get you to praise them like this, do you think that he is suitable for you?” The man asked as he chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, what if I say yes?” said Hai Dongqing with a smile as she looked at the man with her graceful pupils.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I too think that the brat suits you quite well, do you want me to help you build some connections?” The man laughed after thinking for a while.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have you seen how many women are already around him?” Hai Dongqing told the man off while laughing. Her gracious pupils made her seem really unpredictable.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“*Sigh*, this brat really is lecherous……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Every capable man would naturally have more than one women around them. Only those incapable ones are stuck with only one woman. I won’t be happy if I stay by his side. It’s better if I just wait for a man who treats me like a treasure to appear.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I too feel that this Qing Shui is outstanding. No matter how I look at it, every aspect of him perfectly matches the things that you have been seeking for. You really got to think this through carefully. It doesn’t necessarily mean that he wouldn’t spoil you if you’re with him. Look at the women around him, they are all really happy too.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, are you feeling that hurried to get me married?” Hai Dongqing rolled her eyes at the man.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“*Cough, cough*, your brother, I, really can’t wait for you to get married. This is all to make sure that you will be happy. A woman will only feel true happiness once they get married.” The courteous man smiled embarrassingly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">.……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was aware that the enormous tiger that got drawn by his talismans last time was a Demonic Beast which belonged to the old man in front of himt. He hadn’t really interacted with Demon Beast Sect much, but they had tried to assault him multiple times. Every time they did so, he would end up being forced into a life-and-death situation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The feeling of getting bullied was really uncomfortable. They had been doing this for a long time. And now, they even dared to set their foot on the Heavenly Palace. He felt that if he continued allowing them to roam around the world freely, he wouldn’t be qualified to be called the Patriarch of the Heavenly Palace, nor would there be any point in the Heavenly Palace establishing their sect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A thunderous rumble like a tiger’s roar was emitted from Qing Shui’s body. The rumbling noise was capable of stirring one’s heart to the point of making them feel like even their soul was shaking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Emperor’s Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Emperor’s Qi locked the Grand Elder of the Demon Beast Sect as well as the three Demonic Beasts around him. Those were three Peak Martial King Demonic Beast. Their strength was almost equal to the enormous tiger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the current Qing Shui’s point of view, the fearsome existence back then had become really fragile. There was a saying ‘Caution is the parent of safety’, therefore, Qing Shui wouldn’t act rashly, even if it looked really weak.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui moved his entire body to avoid them. Simultaneously, he also summoned the Diamond Gigantic Beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s the overlapping attack again. It once again charged into the Grand Elder. This was the second time Qing Shui had used this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Mighty Elephant Stomp had achieved a strength that was worth as much as twenty six countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But at the time when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant performed the Mighty Elephant Stomp, Qing Shui was stunned. Even though he couldn’t explain it clearly, but he knew that the Mighty Elephant Stomp was upgraded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Large Success Stage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The stomp contained a strength of almost forty countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the Mighty Elephant Stomp was really powerful, it’s true power would only be drawn out when used against a group of people. If the difference in strength wasn’t significant however, the Mighty Elephant Stomp wouldn’t be of much use. But this would be a different story if it was combined with other compatible skills.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui’s eyes turned fierce. He thought about the Heavenly Talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One of the Heavenly Talisman that Qing Shui felt was insanely strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Body Securing Talisman!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body would be secured to one spot for three breaths time. During the time, the users wouldn’t be able to leave the place, but they could still fight and defend.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All along, Qing Shui didn't really dedicate himself to learning this Heavenly Talisman. To say the least, he hadn’t learned it for the awhile. However, Qing Shui has already decided to learn this ‘Body Securing Talisman’ properly. The reason being that it would come in handy when his opponent was attempting to escape. When Qing Shui saw Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Mighty Elephant Stomp, his eyes shone brightly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If the ‘Body Securing Talisman’ was combined with the Mighty Elephant Stomp...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Demon Beast Sect’s Grand Elder spurted up the sky with his body and streaked across the sky like a shadow. However, the Demonic Beasts below were all crushed and killed. The enormous force once again cracked the earth. The terrifying tearing force clashed with Qing Shui’s Mighty Elephant Stomp and caused an enormous crushing force.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Grand Elder who was in mid-air. An unknown flying beast suddenly appeared out of nowhere and caught the Grand Elder. It was about to escape.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the Soul Shaking Bell. Originally, he had planned to use the Red Crimson Bow. But eventually, he changed his mind and instead took out the Soul Shaking Bell which he had never used before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The violet gorgeous bell possessed a unique and unusual strength. Qing Shui aimed the Soul Shaking Bell in his hand at the unknown flying Beast in mid-air and shook it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A violet colored light shot out from the bell. It resembled smoke and mist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A soft colliding noise rang out. The next thing that followed was a mournful cry. The flying beast died immediately and fell down from the sky. Qing Shui summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui &nbsp;dodged it along with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment the Grand Elder dropped down, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant struck into him with its Gigantic Elephant Collision.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ka-cha-cha!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everything went silent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the area within a few hundred meters which was left with a ten meters deep imprint. The entire place was a mess. The ground was already dyed red by fresh blood with broken limbs and arms littered about. It looked mournful and dreary.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">None of the intruders were kept alive. The five hundred people who came from Sword Tower and the two hundred from Demon Beast Sect all died in the battle. Even Heavenly Palace also lost more than a hundred Supreme Elders. However, Cang Wuya and the other two hundred people who watched over the coffin were the people who were truly useful and loyal to Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was why Qing Shui let them kept watch beside the coffin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was because Qing Shui was able to predict the result of the battle. He was also taking the advantage of this battle to remove some of the decaying teeth of Heavenly Palace and the people who harbored bad intentions. Through the Old Ancestor, Qing Shui had found out quite a lot of things about the Heavenly Palace Elder Association.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The funeral continued on.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From this battle, a lot of the ordinary disciples in Heavenly Palace as well as other external forces had become aware of Qing Shui’s true terrifying strength. The originally unstable Heavenly Palace once again regained its firmness which was solid like a mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Other sects, on the other hand, they secretly sighed in sorrow. The future of the Heavenly Palace has been decided. Sword Tower was finished, and so was Demon Beast Sect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The funeral went on all the way until the sky got dark. The Old Ancestor was finally buried in peace. The gravestone was carved by Fei Wuji, who cried sorrowfully. He felt really hurt. Even though it has been a really long time, he was still unable to let go of the incident at that time. Or else, he wouldn’t have ignored the Old Ancestor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He only found out that his grandfather was forced to kill his parents now. If he alone was already feeling so sad, how would his grandfather have felt? Killing his only son with his own hands, that must have hurt him a lot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And also, who would have been able to understand the hardship of not being loved by parents since young?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Donggong clan in Southern Viewing Ministry Continent, Fei Wuji remembered it deep in his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji and Bai Gui guarded the grave together until nighttime. They had to guard it for seven days because this was the culture in Green Cloud Continent. Since Old Ancestor didn’t have any children, his disciples and grandsons would have to be the one to look after it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still intended to go to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at night. Since he didn’t really share any relations with the Old Ancestor, he was only there during the daytime. Qing Shui remembered all the things that the Old Ancestor did for him deep in his heart. He would use other methods to pay him pack.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the evening, Qing Shui went back to Cang Wuya’s place. The two girls were also there. They had already prepared the food. After greeting the two girls, Qing Shui went up to take a bath.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui changed into a new set of clothes and came down. He had dinner with the two girls. After telling them to rest early, he went upstairs straight away. This was because it was the time for him to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal again for the day. Today, he wanted to stay in there for three hours straight at one go.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Lousy Qing Shui, rotten Qing Shui! You still can’t show any intimation even after you took advantage of sister!” Huoyun Liu-Li whispered behind Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You impudent brat! What are you talking about!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t stop his feet and ran up the stairs. He wanted to be closer to them, but he didn’t want his relationship with the girls to be a reason for him to slow down his progress.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he wanted an even better and secure relationships with them, he would need more strength. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be capable of protecting his own women.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword Tower has already been eliminated… The remnants should have more or less been disbanded. It’s just that he was wondering how much treasures would be left behind in Sword Tower.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After seven days, Qing Shui planned to head to Demon Beast Sect. He felt that he should also have a look at Sword Tower.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. After he witnessed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s breakthrough, he felt even more secure with this big fellow around.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, by combining his strength with the &nbsp;Diamond Gigantic Elephant, if he was to perform the Realm of One with Elephant and wield the insane Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui felt that he might possibly for him to fight an ordinary First Grade Martial Saint to a standstill for half an hour. That’s if the Violet Gold Divine Shield could stand the impact and not break. But if it exceeded half an hour, he would have no choice but to suffer the fate of being chopped apart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Compared to four years ago, Qing Shui’s strength has already reached an extent which could topple the world. With the addition of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s breakthrough, Qing Shui felt that he has established an incomparably steady position in Green Cloud Continent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since there were no Martial Saints in Green Cloud Continent, Qing Shui was confident that there was no one in the continent who was capable of beating him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even if a Martial Saint was to intrude the Heavenly Palace, as long as Qing Shui triggered the Violet Divine Crystal, he was confident that he would be able to trap him there for eternity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">(note: fancy way to say kill him)</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly thought about the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s breakthrough, especially when he saw the power of the Mighty Elephant Stomp, he could already tell that the Mighty Elephant Stomp has been upgraded to the Large Success Stage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection were both passive skills. They weren’t able to be upgraded, but they were the most insane techniques. They helped permanently strengthened the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s strength and defense by one fold. Otherwise, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant wouldn’t have been so powerful like now. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp has achieved the Large Success Stage. It could draw out a strength which was five times stronger than its own physical strength and be used it against the ground.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There weren’t any changes in the Gigantic Elephant Impetus.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui has already spotted an additional passive skill below the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection. It’s the Diamond Crossing Rivers.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Crossing Rivers: Passive skill, permanently increases Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s speed by one fold.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No wonder it could be so fast.” Qing Shui secretly said. Originally, although the Diamond Gigantic Elephant wasn’t really fast, it could still be considered to have an average speed compared to normal Demonic Beasts. Its main assets lied in its defense and physical strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, one passive skill was already more than enough to strengthen it by folds. Just like the saying ‘adding wings to a tiger’, this was exactly how Qing Shui was feeling at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was really satisfied. This passive skill was not inferior to the Mighty Elephant Stomp at all. For now, Qing Shui has experienced just how insane the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was. Three passive skills, all of which were extremely terrifying.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Later on, Qing Shui saw two skills which required ‘Inner Core Qi’. He looked through it with interest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Instantaneous Diamond Evasion: Triggered instantaneously in an area within a hundred meters. Speed would increase again by one fold.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui remembered the terrifying speed shown by the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He figured out that it was this battle skill which it used. To the current Diamond Gigantic Elephant, this was a terrifying battle skill because it managed to help it overcome its lack of speed in the past.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui set his sight on the last battle skill which was shining.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ferocious Diamond Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ferocious Diamond Attack: A physical attack launched by the Diamond Gigantic Elephant in an instant. It increases its offensive strength by up to one fold.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 537 - A Slaughter , The Insane Diamond Gigantic Elephant</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Such terrifying speed……” Qing Shui stared blankly at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the Diamond Gigantic Elephant didn’t break through to the Martial Saint Grade, Qing Shui felt that it’s within his expectations. After all, it previously only managed to achieve the strength equivalent to an Eighth Grade Martial King. Although its strength still exceeded that of a human Eighth Grade Martial King, it was still restricted by the limitations of its cultivation grades. Its speed in particular. This had caused the strength of the Diamond Gigantic Beast to be restricted significantly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, after breaking through to the pinnacle of the Martial King Grade, its strength doubled and surpassed the Demonic Beasts with sharp ten countries worth of strength. At this rate, it would only have to break through one more time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The next time it broke through, it would be a Martial Saint Grade Demonic Beast. To both Demonic Beasts and human warriors, the Martial Saint Grade was an impassable abyss. Regarding the strength of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Qing Shui was already quite satisfied with it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In an instant, the Diamond Gigantic Beast had already charged into the crowds in the Demon Beast Sect. Due to the crowd being extremely concentrated in one area, almost half of the men from Demon Beast Sect straight away lost their ability to fight. A third of the people died on the spot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For the people who remained, there were also some of them who swung their weapons and struck towards the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. A loud clang resounded as the weapons collided with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's armor like hide. It made them felt particularly helpless. Their hearts felt as if they turned into dead ashes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A defensive strength of more than thirty countries was just too insane! Unless they performed a combined attack which was perfectly in sync, &nbsp;it would be futile even if they had more weapons. Their strengths were all scattered, it’s just like when a child hit an adult, the adult wouldn’t feel hurt. Even if there were more children hitting him, he would still feel nothing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With its current strength, it would be basically really hard for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to meet its match in the Green Cloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked on as the Diamond Gigantic Beast drove back and forth the crowd in the Demon Beast Sect like a phantom with its enormous body. Its gigantic body was as agile as an ape, it looked really smooth and violent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A golden light flashed. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant shot out a thread and created a golden afterimage. It was an indescribable feeling of power.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The shining Diamond Gigantic Elephant immediately charged towards the defenseless Demonic Beast Sect’s Supreme Leader.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Its tremendous strength immediately killed a few people on the spot. The smell of blood started to spread out through the air. The entire area was filled with an intractable pressure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In its breakthrough this time, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant once again gained new abilities.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw the previous attacks and speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he could already tell that it had awakened its battle techniques that probably stemmed from its ancestral memories.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, Qing Shui didn’t have the time to witness it because he was occupied with the things around him. There was still a Grand Elder left with a few formidable Demonic Beasts on his side.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the Demon Beast Sect hadn’t sent out all of their troops, they had already used up almost half of their strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, Green Cloud Continent is about to undergo a significant change. Hehe, who would have thought that he would be the one to trigger it?” Hai Dongqing smiled at the man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Dongqing, tell me, is this a good thing or a bad thing?” The man knitted his brows and asked as he glanced towards the short yet chivalrous young man standing afar.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Whether it’s good or bad, it doesn’t matter. Among the nine, the Green Cloud Continent has akways been the weakest continent for so many years. I feel that this might be a chance for it to change, everything might change because of him.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If the Heavenly Palace were to rise……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m also just making a guess. But it is really rare to see someone who is as talented and stunning as him. In the future, he alone will be enough to cause chaos across the World of the Nine Continents.” Hai Dongqing smile faintly as she looked at Qing Shui from behind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is the first time you have complimented someone to this extent. For someone who can get you to praise them like this, do you think that he is suitable for you?” The man asked as he chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, what if I say yes?” said Hai Dongqing with a smile as she looked at the man with her graceful pupils.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I too think that the brat suits you quite well, do you want me to help you build some connections?” The man laughed after thinking for a while.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Have you seen how many women are already around him?” Hai Dongqing told the man off while laughing. Her gracious pupils made her seem really unpredictable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“*Sigh*, this brat really is lecherous……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Every capable man would naturally have more than one women around them. Only those incapable ones are stuck with only one woman. I won’t be happy if I stay by his side. It’s better if I just wait for a man who treats me like a treasure to appear.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I too feel that this Qing Shui is outstanding. No matter how I look at it, every aspect of him perfectly matches the things that you have been seeking for. You really got to think this through carefully. It doesn’t necessarily mean that he wouldn’t spoil you if you’re with him. Look at the women around him, they are all really happy too.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, are you feeling that hurried to get me married?” Hai Dongqing rolled her eyes at the man.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“*Cough, cough*, your brother, I, really can’t wait for you to get married. This is all to make sure that you will be happy. A woman will only feel true happiness once they get married.” The courteous man smiled embarrassingly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">.……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was aware that the enormous tiger that got drawn by his talismans last time was a Demonic Beast which belonged to the old man in front of himt. He hadn’t really interacted with Demon Beast Sect much, but they had tried to assault him multiple times. Every time they did so, he would end up being forced into a life-and-death situation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The feeling of getting bullied was really uncomfortable. They had been doing this for a long time. And now, they even dared to set their foot on the Heavenly Palace. He felt that if he continued allowing them to roam around the world freely, he wouldn’t be qualified to be called the Patriarch of the Heavenly Palace, nor would there be any point in the Heavenly Palace establishing their sect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A thunderous rumble like a tiger’s roar was emitted from Qing Shui’s body. The rumbling noise was capable of stirring one’s heart to the point of making them feel like even their soul was shaking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Emperor’s Qi locked the Grand Elder of the Demon Beast Sect as well as the three Demonic Beasts around him. Those were three Peak Martial King Demonic Beast. Their strength was almost equal to the enormous tiger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the current Qing Shui’s point of view, the fearsome existence back then had become really fragile. There was a saying ‘Caution is the parent of safety’, therefore, Qing Shui wouldn’t act rashly, even if it looked really weak.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui moved his entire body to avoid them. Simultaneously, he also summoned the Diamond Gigantic Beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s the overlapping attack again. It once again charged into the Grand Elder. This was the second time Qing Shui had used this.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Mighty Elephant Stomp had achieved a strength that was worth as much as twenty six countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But at the time when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant performed the Mighty Elephant Stomp, Qing Shui was stunned. Even though he couldn’t explain it clearly, but he knew that the Mighty Elephant Stomp was upgraded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Large Success Stage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The stomp contained a strength of almost forty countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the Mighty Elephant Stomp was really powerful, it’s true power would only be drawn out when used against a group of people. If the difference in strength wasn’t significant however, the Mighty Elephant Stomp wouldn’t be of much use. But this would be a different story if it was combined with other compatible skills.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui’s eyes turned fierce. He thought about the Heavenly Talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One of the Heavenly Talisman that Qing Shui felt was insanely strong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Body Securing Talisman!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His body would be secured to one spot for three breaths time. During the time, the users wouldn’t be able to leave the place, but they could still fight and defend.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All along, Qing Shui didn't really dedicate himself to learning this Heavenly Talisman. To say the least, he hadn’t learned it for the awhile. However, Qing Shui has already decided to learn this ‘Body Securing Talisman’ properly. The reason being that it would come in handy when his opponent was attempting to escape. When Qing Shui saw Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Mighty Elephant Stomp, his eyes shone brightly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If the ‘Body Securing Talisman’ was combined with the Mighty Elephant Stomp...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Demon Beast Sect’s Grand Elder spurted up the sky with his body and streaked across the sky like a shadow. However, the Demonic Beasts below were all crushed and killed. The enormous force once again cracked the earth. The terrifying tearing force clashed with Qing Shui’s Mighty Elephant Stomp and caused an enormous crushing force.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Grand Elder who was in mid-air. An unknown flying beast suddenly appeared out of nowhere and caught the Grand Elder. It was about to escape.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the Soul Shaking Bell. Originally, he had planned to use the Red Crimson Bow. But eventually, he changed his mind and instead took out the Soul Shaking Bell which he had never used before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The violet gorgeous bell possessed a unique and unusual strength. Qing Shui aimed the Soul Shaking Bell in his hand at the unknown flying Beast in mid-air and shook it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A violet colored light shot out from the bell. It resembled smoke and mist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A soft colliding noise rang out. The next thing that followed was a mournful cry. The flying beast died immediately and fell down from the sky. Qing Shui summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui &nbsp;dodged it along with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment the Grand Elder dropped down, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant struck into him with its Gigantic Elephant Collision.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ka-cha-cha!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everything went silent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the area within a few hundred meters which was left with a ten meters deep imprint. The entire place was a mess. The ground was already dyed red by fresh blood with broken limbs and arms littered about. It looked mournful and dreary.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">None of the intruders were kept alive. The five hundred people who came from Sword Tower and the two hundred from Demon Beast Sect all died in the battle. Even Heavenly Palace also lost more than a hundred Supreme Elders. However, Cang Wuya and the other two hundred people who watched over the coffin were the people who were truly useful and loyal to Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was why Qing Shui let them kept watch beside the coffin.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was because Qing Shui was able to predict the result of the battle. He was also taking the advantage of this battle to remove some of the decaying teeth of Heavenly Palace and the people who harbored bad intentions. Through the Old Ancestor, Qing Shui had found out quite a lot of things about the Heavenly Palace Elder Association.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The funeral continued on.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From this battle, a lot of the ordinary disciples in Heavenly Palace as well as other external forces had become aware of Qing Shui’s true terrifying strength. The originally unstable Heavenly Palace once again regained its firmness which was solid like a mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Other sects, on the other hand, they secretly sighed in sorrow. The future of the Heavenly Palace has been decided. Sword Tower was finished, and so was Demon Beast Sect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The funeral went on all the way until the sky got dark. The Old Ancestor was finally buried in peace. The gravestone was carved by Fei Wuji, who cried sorrowfully. He felt really hurt. Even though it has been a really long time, he was still unable to let go of the incident at that time. Or else, he wouldn’t have ignored the Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He only found out that his grandfather was forced to kill his parents now. If he alone was already feeling so sad, how would his grandfather have felt? Killing his only son with his own hands, that must have hurt him a lot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And also, who would have been able to understand the hardship of not being loved by parents since young?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Donggong clan in Southern Viewing Ministry Continent, Fei Wuji remembered it deep in his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji and Bai Gui guarded the grave together until nighttime. They had to guard it for seven days because this was the culture in Green Cloud Continent. Since Old Ancestor didn’t have any children, his disciples and grandsons would have to be the one to look after it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still intended to go to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at night. Since he didn’t really share any relations with the Old Ancestor, he was only there during the daytime. Qing Shui remembered all the things that the Old Ancestor did for him deep in his heart. He would use other methods to pay him pack.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the evening, Qing Shui went back to Cang Wuya’s place. The two girls were also there. They had already prepared the food. After greeting the two girls, Qing Shui went up to take a bath.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui changed into a new set of clothes and came down. He had dinner with the two girls. After telling them to rest early, he went upstairs straight away. This was because it was the time for him to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal again for the day. Today, he wanted to stay in there for three hours straight at one go.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Lousy Qing Shui, rotten Qing Shui! You still can’t show any intimation even after you took advantage of sister!” Huoyun Liu-Li whispered behind Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You impudent brat! What are you talking about!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t stop his feet and ran up the stairs. He wanted to be closer to them, but he didn’t want his relationship with the girls to be a reason for him to slow down his progress.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he wanted an even better and secure relationships with them, he would need more strength. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be capable of protecting his own women.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword Tower has already been eliminated… The remnants should have more or less been disbanded. It’s just that he was wondering how much treasures would be left behind in Sword Tower.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After seven days, Qing Shui planned to head to Demon Beast Sect. He felt that he should also have a look at Sword Tower.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. After he witnessed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s breakthrough, he felt even more secure with this big fellow around.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, by combining his strength with the &nbsp;Diamond Gigantic Elephant, if he was to perform the Realm of One with Elephant and wield the insane Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui felt that he might possibly for him to fight an ordinary First Grade Martial Saint to a standstill for half an hour. That’s if the Violet Gold Divine Shield could stand the impact and not break. But if it exceeded half an hour, he would have no choice but to suffer the fate of being chopped apart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Compared to four years ago, Qing Shui’s strength has already reached an extent which could topple the world. With the addition of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s breakthrough, Qing Shui felt that he has established an incomparably steady position in Green Cloud Continent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since there were no Martial Saints in Green Cloud Continent, Qing Shui was confident that there was no one in the continent who was capable of beating him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even if a Martial Saint was to intrude the Heavenly Palace, as long as Qing Shui triggered the Violet Divine Crystal, he was confident that he would be able to trap him there for eternity.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">(note: fancy way to say kill him)</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly thought about the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s breakthrough, especially when he saw the power of the Mighty Elephant Stomp, he could already tell that the Mighty Elephant Stomp has been upgraded to the Large Success Stage.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp has achieved the Large Success Stage. It could draw out a strength which was five times stronger than its own physical strength and be used it against the ground.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There weren’t any changes in the Gigantic Elephant Impetus.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui has already spotted an additional passive skill below the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection. It’s the Diamond Crossing Rivers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Crossing Rivers: Passive skill, permanently increases Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s speed by one fold.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No wonder it could be so fast.” Qing Shui secretly said. Originally, although the Diamond Gigantic Elephant wasn’t really fast, it could still be considered to have an average speed compared to normal Demonic Beasts. Its main assets lied in its defense and physical strength.</p>
