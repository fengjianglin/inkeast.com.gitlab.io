 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man trembled when he saw Qing Shui’s face now. It wasn’t rage that caused a person to shake. If one wasn’t strong enough, then its anger could only be considered as merely getting angry. But at this moment, the old man felt a sense of killing intent from Qing Shui, which came from deep within his heart. It was like a solid substance cutting through his skin and hurting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even if that was the case, the old man had no intention to admit defeat. Sacred Medicine Palace had been passed down for a long time. If it was to be insulted by a nameless young man, how could they continue to hold their heads up? They would turn into a joke for many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will let you go if you hand over that medical skills of yours.” The old man spoke slowly after pondering over the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man, “Old geezer, you finally showed your true color and revealed to your disciples and grand disciples just how much of a disgraceful person you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am merely thinking for them. Since I don’t have much longer to live, these things are all for them.” The old man said with a very ‘righteous’ tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people around him didn’t actually find it strange. On the contrary, they got even more protective towards the old man. If a person was doing things by placing other people before him, even if he did bad things, it would be very easy for him to be pardoned by the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great, this is just too impressive. With a master like you supporting this place, the Sacred Medicine Palace must have been managed to live to this day very persistently. Just as the saying goes ‘one who is willing to throw away his face will be regarded as invincible’. I have finally seen it for myself today.” Qing Shui didn’t feel good about the Sacred Medicine Palace at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, what do you plan to do about it? You can decide whether or not you want to live.” The old man continued on to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have said it wrong. It should be the other way around. It seems you didn’t get the things which I said earlier into your head. Let me tell you just this once, one’s greed may potentially lead them to a very bad consequence.” Qing Shui took out the Golden Battle Halberd and summoned the Dragon Slaying Beast as soon as he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you! Go! Hong Chen, take a few men with you and kidnap the woman and child for me.” The old man said with a gloomy voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was enraged, truly enraged. This old geezer was extremely despicable. Seeing that, Qing Shui no longer had any intention to hold back. He teleported instantly and appeared on the old man’s left side. There was no need to mention about how extraordinary Nine Continents Step was. He immediately unleashed the Anger of Mad Dragon with his Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man dodged and shot the long sword in his hand towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t intend to battle for too long. He was skillfully applying the Basic Sword Technique into the Golden Battle Halberd as he shot it through the old man’s throat from a slanted angle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s long sword was about to pierce through Qing Shui’s chest, but Qing Shui’s battle technique which put his life at stake also gave him quite a surprise. Nevertheless, the old man didn’t take back his sword just because of this. Instead, he shot it towards Qing Shui with an even greater speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also really surprised. Qing Shui wielded the Paragon Golden Armor. He had a feeling that the old man should also have a treasure like that. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to attack him so boldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s chest was pierced by the long sword, but it only went into his body by a little before it stopped. The Paragon Golden Armor didn’t appear, which caught Qing Shui by surprise. He didn’t know if he should feel happy or upset about it. Happy because his current defensive prowess was formidable. Upset because he was injured. Even though the injury he suffered wasn’t really heavy, an injury was still an injury. Fortunately, it didn’t hold him back at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd had also managed to strike the old man’s throat. A bright silvery light shone. The old man wasn’t surprised. But following on, he was suddenly in a lot of fear. This was because the ring of light actually exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s face turned pale as he backed off quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. The ‘Piercing Ability’ of the Golden Battle Halberd appeared. It was supposed to be an ability which had a very small chance of being activated. From here, it could be seen just how wicked this old man was. To think that the Piercing Ability would appear right on the first attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the old man backed off quickly, he still didn’t dodge the attack completely and got hit in his collarbone. It seemed as though the Golden Battle Halberd just slashed through his body, leaving a deep bloody scar and snapped the collarbone across his body. Although the old man managed to stay alive, the injury he suffered, seemed heavier than Qing Shui’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Chen and the others immediately made their way towards Qing Ci and Little Mo. The Dragon Slaying Beast, on the other hand, ran back to protect them. Qing Shui summoned the Nine Continents Mountain to block Hong Chen’s path off. The size of the Nine Continents Mountain was like a small mountain. He only needed to move it a little, and a lot of injuries would have happened. As for the Dragon Slaying Beast, other than Hong Chen and a minority of people, it killed off the rest of the enemies with ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Dragon Slaying Beast was fast enough, even the old man or Hong Chen wouldn’t be enough for the Dragon Slaying Beast to fill the gaps between its teeth with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui couldn’t care less about them. In any case, he still hadn’t used the absolute protection provided by the Paragon Golden Armor. Could there be any better timing for him to kill his enemies? When he unleashed the Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique with his Golden Battle Halberd, he looked like a God who came down from the sky. The people who charged towards Qing Shui immediately got their limbs cut off. The sky was filled with bloody smells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after he had crossed fists with Qing Shui, did he realize that he had underestimated Qing Shui’s ability. At first, he thought that Qing Shui was at the early level of Divine Grade or even below that. After all, Qing Shui could already be considered as a genius even if he was at that level. It was only now that he realized he was very wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had a bad feeling about this. Just as the young man said before, their sect might be annihilated. The imagination immediately caused the old man’s head to turn blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A false decision could instantly lead to the downfall of a sect. Before this, the opponent had given him the chance to live, but instead, he chose not to. It seemed that he could no longer undo his decision now even if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the long sword in his hand, the old man once again charged towards Qing Shui. He moved his sight to Hong Chen. Kidnapping the woman and her child was practically impossible at this point. Not only was there a formidable offensive Magic Weapon that resembled a small mountain, but it was even accompanied by a fearsome demonic beast. Even though this demonic beast was quite small, it still managed to kill more than ten powerful beasts in an instant. They were all killed from having their throats pierced by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of existence had he provoked? It was undeniable that the Sacred Medicine Palace was a force with authority across the Great Shang City. Though they specialized in medicinal herbs, they also possessed decent strength and cultivations. Yet now, they were actually at the brink of destruction because of a young man…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder how you are going to face the past Palace Lords of the Sacred Medicine Palace when you go to the other world. Persisting in evil brings self-destruction. If you keep doing the same thing over and over again, there is bound to be a time when you will run into misfortunes.” Qing Shui coldly wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth. He was also injured. However, both his ability to self-recover and his endurance towards attacks were beyond a normal person’s imaginations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am going to kill you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s long sword was shining brightly. A holy aura was emitting from it as it constantly healed the old man’s body. Furthermore, it was also increasing the old man’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sword Swallow!</span></p>

Their spirit and will had merged together.</span></p>

The old man fed himself to the sword. There should be a time limit for a skill like that. No matter how things turned out, the old man was sure to be crippled today. At the moment, Qing Shui was thinking more about his safety. The opponent’s killer move should be very formidable since he was already able to wound Qing Shui before. He could also tell that this sword was an extraordinary item. Now that the old man fed the sword with his Origin Essence, his ability was sure to increase significantly</span></p>

Its speed was so fast that it became like a meteor in the sky.</span></p>

Flying Swords? Could this be Flying Swords? Qing Shui had been working hard hoping that he could get a decent Flying Sword. Qing Shui felt that the offensive prowess of the Flying Swords was sure to be great, so much that it might surpass the Nine Continents Mountain. Another feature about the Flying Swords was its speed. It was so fast that it became unblockable.</span></p>

However, his entire body was blown backward as a result of the impact. He shook. If it wasn’t because of his breakthrough to the level of Buddha Light Treasure Qi, it was very likely that the attack would have caused him to waste his Paragon Golden Armor.</span></p>

This time, it was from up close and its speed was also 10% faster than before. As it shot towards Qing Shui, He had a feeling that he wouldn’t be able to stop it. He watched as the sword pierced through his chest.</span></p>
