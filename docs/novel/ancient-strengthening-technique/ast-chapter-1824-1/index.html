 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They instantly arrived at the Divine Cave that was in the Ice Ocean Domain. This wasn't the first time Yiye Jiange had traveled in this manner between the Qing Clan’s residence and the North Sea. Qin Qing had experienced it before and Tantai Lingyan wasn't a person who would be easily taken by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This method saved them a lot of time. The Divine Cave was exactly the same as before when they left. It was clean and everything was in abundance. Moreover, there was a kind of natural elegance about the cave. Previously, Qing Shui had set up a restriction here and thus, this place was a residence for Qing Shui and the ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, when the Sea King Palace hadn't yet moved, Qing Shui had stayed here. Thinking back, over ten years had passed and it had been a very long time since he had lived here. However, this place was still a very important location for Qing Shui to move between the Dancing Phoenix Continent and the Haohan Continent. Without this place, Qing Shui would need to spend a lot of time on his travels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cave was right next to the Linhai City and wasn't that far away from the Great Qin Dynasty either. It was the entrance to the Northern Sea City and only one step away from the palaces. The Sunset Sea King Palace, Dragonwolf Palace...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, Qing Shui realized that he had gotten himself involved with quite a number of forces. There was also the Divine Moon Immortal Sect...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't plan on staying here either. It had been some time and he should go to the Sunset Sea King Palace to check if they were fine. Therefore, he brought the group along with him and used the Nine Continents Step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing also went along to the Sunset Sea King Palace. The moment they entered, the few ladies came out, Qing Hanye included. Seeing that they were all fine, Qing Shui was relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Qingcheng seemed to be in a better condition now. They said that when one managed to survive an ordeal, they'd be able to enjoy great fortune. There was some sort of sense to this saying. However, Qing Shui wasn't very familiar with the metaphysics. The fact that both good and evil would each have their just desserts was related to the law of cause and effect. Nevertheless, enjoying great fortune after surviving an ordeal seemed to be a change in mentality and character for Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most people, after experiencing life and death, would go through a huge change in their lives. This was especially so in Qing Shui's previous life. For example, if a person were to survive a traffic accident, there would usually be two options after recovery. One would live life freely without any restrictions, thinking that life was too fragile and could be gone at any moment. Therefore, the choice would be to let loose of oneself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another option was to treasure. There would be a feeling that it wasn't easy to get one’s life back and it must be treasured more. One would understand many things and tend to turn over a new leaf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, despite the options one took, there would experience a huge change in mentality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same in this world. Although a cultivator's life was spent licking blood off one’s blade, many cultivators might never get to experience a life or death battle in their entire lives. After all, there were too many cultivators and only the true martial arts practitioners would occasionally experience life and death battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Qingcheng's mentality had undergone a huge change. Her previous experience with life and death made her say many things that she didn't wish to, resulting in a promised relationship between her and Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge and Qing Hanye walked over happily toward Qing Shui, Yiye Jiange, and Qin Qing. They also picked up Qing Xiu happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Did anything happen within this short period of time?" Qing Shui was glad to see that they were fine. No matter how serious things were, things would be fine now. Therefore, he merely asked casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Everything's fine. It hasn't been that long and nothing major has happened."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ladies were then introduced to Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing. They said that heroes cherished heroes. In fact, it was the same between beauties as well. Moreover, the few ladies were all very strong and were not that far away from each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the few ladies got to know each other, they looked at Qing Shui strangely. They felt that the most beautiful ladies in the world had all gathered around Qing Shui. All of them recognized that they were very beautiful, but when they saw each other, none could say that there was one more beautiful than the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn't compare them either. He couldn't say who was more beautiful than the other, but he knew that he wasn't a devoted man. A man who was devoted would be able to distinguish the most beautiful woman. There were men who would seem as if they had gone crazy if they fell in love with one particular woman. No matter how beautiful other women were, they wouldn't be willing to give them a second glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Men like that were devoted. They could be described as single-minded or dim-witted. Of course, there were also people who would say that a woman had cast a spell over said man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui hadn't been like that in his previous life, he was still considered as quite devoted. After arriving in this world, he felt that he was still devoted and simple-minded. However, not even demonic beasts would believe him if he was saying that...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At noon, Qing Shui took charge of the cooking while the ladies also helped. They made a sumptuous meal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lingyan, Qing`er, what plans do you guys have? Do you want to stay here?" Qing Shui asked them over the meal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I think we better head back to the Imperial Cuisine Hall in a while!" Qin Qing gave it some thought before saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the world in the ocean and although there wasn't much impact to live here, both of them still preferred to stay on land. Moreover, the two of them weren't that familiar with the few ladies here either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui merely brought this up. He knew that the chances of them staying wouldn't be high. However, after knowing that they wanted to head to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Qing Shui nodded. He gave it some thought and said, "You guys must take care of each other and if there are any troubles, do inform one another."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry. We know that." Yiye Jiange said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmmm, we know." Qin Qing smiled softly as she looked at Qing Shui. Her gentleness and understanding made Qing Shui very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll go with them to the Imperial Cuisine Hall to take a look. You guys haven't known each other for very long and can have a good chat. I'll be back after spending some time there." After lunch, Qing Shui said to them before leaving with the two ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, be careful on your way."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Linhai City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Sea King Palace was very near to Linhai City and so it didn’t take long for them to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was snowing in Linhai City. This wasn't a strange sight. Most areas in the Ice Domain Dynasty faced winter throughout the year. The Linhai City was close to the Ice Ocean Domain. Thus, the temperature there was low and there would often be snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was in a good mood now. He looked at the falling snowflakes, at how the entire place was covered in white and silver. He then looked at the two ladies next to him, Tantai Lingyan especially. There was an indescribable sense of harmony as if they had become a part of the surrounding world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Power! Aura!</span></p>
