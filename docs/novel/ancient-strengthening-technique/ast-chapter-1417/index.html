 <p><strong>AST 1417 - Mermaid Domination? Dragon Palace? Ancient Ruins</strong></p>
 <p>Jin Ci looked at Qing Shui. Right now the two of them are undoubtedly opposing each other. So what if Qing Shui was a member of Demon Lord Palace? So was Jin Ci. He was not obligated to do anything for him.</p>
 <p>Since Jin Ci had come, Qing Shui guessed that Jin Ci must know of his ways of retaining youth. Helping him with it would not be a problem. He could leave a good impression as a bonus. As for chasing after the Demon Lord, Qing Shui feels that his chances are close to zero, just as Jin Ci said so himself. Qing Shui definitely has the highest chances.</p>
 <p>No matter how you look at it, he had been the Demon Lord's first man and, as of now, was probably still the only one.</p>
 <p>A woman's first impression of a man is of utmost importance, which is why Qing Shui felt that he had an absolute advantage. Surely he was the first person that came into mind when the Demon Lord selected a partner. He still would have had a better chance even if he was up against someone more outstanding than him – well, not that there were many people out there more outstanding than him, even excluding age restrictions.</p>
 <p>"Sure, you don't have to say thanks. We're friends aren't we, I don't like fussing about that much." Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>Jin Ci felt bad. After all, he had originally come to talk about the Demon Lord, but ended up bringing up retaining his youth. This made it suspicious as to what his true aim was.</p>
 <p>"I'll leave it to you then, Brother Qing. If there's anything you need, just say so." Jin Ci said seriously.</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui wanted. There were still lots of things to be done at Demon Lord Palace that needs some help. Although he is an elder, he does not have much power, unlike the 12 Earthly Branches.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was currently in the Medical Pavilion, one of the 12 Earthly Branches. Plus, he was an elder who helped cure the Vice Palace Lord's body. He was now second-in-charge of the Medical Pavilion and was considered halfway towards becoming a Devil Chief.</p>
 <p>The current Pavilion Chief was the old monster. He insisted on Qing Shui becoming the new Pavilion Chief but Qing Shui refused, so he could only hold on to the position. In spite of that, almost every member of the Medical Pavilion knows that it was only a matter of time before Qing Shui takes up that post.</p>
 <p>The Medical Pavilion had the fewest members. Even so, there were still a lot of them. After all, it was one of the 12 Earthly Branches. If there were too little members, it would not have become one of the branches.</p>
 <p>"Brother Jin, you're being too polite. This medicinal pill can retain your youth for another century, and has healing properties too. You can decide yourself when to eat it." Qing Shui smiled and handed the Golden Fragrance Jade to him.</p>
 <p>"Oh, in that case, I'll keep it for now. It might come in handy in the upcoming battle between Demon Lord Palace and Dragon Palace in half a month's time." Jin Ci kept it carefully, not wanting to ruin the medicinal pill.</p>
 <p>"Battle with Dragon Palace? In Half a month's time?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui flinched. It seemed that his intel was not that good. The other reason was because of the name Dragon Palace – he had not known that such a thing existed.</p>
 <p>"Dragon Palace is a powerful force in the Dragon Abyss Ocean of the Soaring Dragon Continent. Their existence is like a mirage. These people live on the ocean. They are known to have many strong warriors at sea, with a huge palace deep in the ocean and have strong immortal demons at their disposal." Jin Ci told Qing Shui frankly.</p>
 <p>Immortal demons were as intelligent as the Hellfire Phoenix and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Though not as cunning as humans, they cared a lot about their safety. Moreover, they have their own King and pride as a race.</p>
 <p>To beasts, especially wiser beasts, humans are inferior. Humans have far weaker bodies, and have inferior weapons, agility, adaptability compared to them. The only difference is that humans are slicker, but still a formidable foe of the beasts. Therefore, they do not think of humans as superior, just like how humans do not think of beasts as superior.</p>
 <p>Things like mounts and beast taming were almost equal once a certain level is achieved. Beast tamers were always a match with their tamed beasts.</p>
 <p>Strong beasts in the sea were even more formidable than terrestrial beasts. Aquatic creatures usually have high spirituality, some are even close to humans, such as the Mermaids.</p>
 <p>Mermaids are usually thought as gentle beauties. But here in the World of Nine Continents, they are different. Qing Shui had yet to see them, but rumors said that this mysterious race existed deep in the ocean.</p>
 <p>Mermaids are the true kings of the deep ocean, and are above Hai Long. Mermaids and humans are very alike, they even have legs. Besides their anatomy, they are exactly the same as humans. For example, they are more adapted to living in the ocean, and their battle power increases greatly at sea, but decreases on land.</p>
 <p>The legend of Mermaids had always been a mysterious one. Legends have it that they evolved from humans who had adapted to living in the ocean and were extremely beautiful. There were both male and female mermaids, living in underwater palaces.</p>
 <p>The seas of The World of Nine Continents were just as scary as its land, maybe even scarier.</p>
 <p>As for the Dragon Palace of the Soaring Dragon Continent, they did not know if the mermaids would be participating, or Hai Long.</p>
 <p>According to legend, mermaids specialized in spirit energy and water element abilities, but because this race resided deep in the ocean and were insanely strong, normal people would not encounter them.</p>
 <p>"Brother Jin, I wonder how many people will the Demon Lord Palace send and who's participating?" Qing Shui felt like he wanted to see for himself, he was now a lot stronger than he was before. At the very least, Jin Ci is no match for him, he would be an easy kill.</p>
 <p>"Since Dragon Palace will not be an easy enemy, this time, two branch halls will be sent out, along with the Palace Lord and Vice Palace Lord." Jin Ci did not hide it.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui left and went to look for the Vice Palace Lord, Hua Rumei.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei's complexion was pleasant and it seemed that she was in a good mood. As soon as she saw Qing Shui, she dragged him into the living room. Qing Shui scratched his nose – this woman is rather intimate. It was as if they are real siblings.</p>
 <p>The feeling was very strong, and not at all feigned. Some things just could not be faked.</p>
 <p>"Sister, is it true that we're making a move against Dragon Palace in half a month's time?" There was no need for him to hold back against this cheap sister.</p>
 <p>"I knew you'd come for this matter. I've already put your name in it. My, how impatient you are," Hua Rumei smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>A faint shyness showed on Qing Shui's face:"I knew Sister would treat me best."</p>
 <p>"Ahem, save the sweet talk if you can't manage it. Such insincerity, it's so weird it has become obvious." said Hua Rumei, unable to hold in her laughter.</p>
 <p>"Sister, is Dragon Palace strong?" He felt that Hua Rumei should know more than this.</p>
 <p>"There are too many strong sects in Soaring Dragon Continent. Dragon Palace is more special, it is a strong force of justice, and is one of the people targeting the lord of Demon Lord Palace,"</p>
 <p>"I wonder how we'll act against Dragon Palace this time?" Qing Shui asked out of curiosity.</p>
 <p>"There's an Ancient Ruin in the Soaring Dragon Continent, and it's abandoned. It has long been emptied but it has been an ancient battlefield. Battles have always taken place there.”</p>
 <p>"Ancient Ruin?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized he had been in awe for the whole day. He had heard about Ancient Ruins and ancient battlefields before, but this time he was hearing it with his own ears – and he was about to see a real ancient battlefield with his own eyes soon.</p>
 <p>"Yes, there's nothing much left in the ancient battlefield, but it's impossible that everything has been looted. With luck, we might find some good stuff. However, it is a special place in these lands. Inside, there are powerful and vicious beasts. Some say that the Ancient Ruins are actually the deep parts of Haohan Continent,"</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei continued:"This has not been confirmed, it's just a speculation."</p>
 <p>"Is it possible for people other than Dragon Palace to enter?" Qing Shui thought and asked.</p>
 <p>"Yes, and in fact that possibility is very high. But, even entering there in big numbers isn't necessarily good. It is very chaotic inside, and extremely dangerous. Demon Lord Palace has an advantage in our formations. So, big numbers don't seem to be good, instead it will make us more cautious. No matter how strong the troops are, as long as there is someone with absolute strength, even one person would be sufficient." Hua Rumei said smiling.</p>
 <p>"Don't we, the Demon Lord Palace, have strong allies?" Qing Shui asked with the thought of the Four Great Evil Powers in mind.</p>
 <p>"No!"</p>
 <p>"What about the Divine Sound Sect, didn't we work together once before?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, we did, but we are not allies, we just occasionally have common enemies. Actually, people are saying that the Four Great Evil Powers split into two, with the Demon Lord Palace and Divine Sound Sect as a pair, and the Divine Beast Sect with the Wild Ghost Valley. If we do have an ally, it would be the Divine Sound Sect." Hua Rumei said.</p>
 <p>"I bumped into some people from the Divine Sound Sect when I came here. They were fighting with people from Eternal Spring Palace, so I gave a hand."</p>
 <p>” Shen Ling is very beautiful, ain't she!" Hua Rumei suddenly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>"Yes, very beautiful indeed. Just that most men won't be able to handle her because of the Bones of Immortal Fox." Qing Shui shook his head and laughed.</p>
 <p>"You didn't seem like you know these stuff. Here, come and see what constitution I am." Hua Rumei said laughingly.</p>
 <p>"You really want to know?" Qing Shui thought before saying.</p>
 <p>"Of course!"</p>
 <p>"Sister you are of Inner Charm Physique, your husband will be very lucky," Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>Inner Charm... In other words, Inner Coquette… Naughty~</p>
 <p>"Oh my, you dare tease even me?" Hua Rumei pinched Qing Shui, face blushing. Only she knew whether what Qing Shui had said was correct, but by the look on her face, he probably was.</p>
 <p>"No, I dare not. Oh yeah, these are for you." Qing Shui changed the topic and gave the Purple Jade Pendants to her.</p>
 <p>"Meeting you during the final periods of my life has really changed my life." Hua Rumei accepted the pendants happily without saying thanks.</p>
 <p>"You would have been fine even if you didn't ask, there will be a savior to help you."</p>
 <p>"You are that savior of mine. I'll go whip up some food. Let's eat together." She said while laughing.</p>
 <p>"I'll go with you."</p>
 <p>Even though they just met, Qing Shui and Hua Rumei have strangely gotten pretty close. Qing Shui can be considered as her savior, and she doesn't hold back on the intimacy with him, and Qing Shui felt that Hua Rumei treats him very well. No matter how you look at it, she was just like an older sister.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, when we go to the Ancient Ruins, let's go together. That way, you can fight alongside the Palace Lord. Just don't hold us back, kay?" Hua Rumei smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
