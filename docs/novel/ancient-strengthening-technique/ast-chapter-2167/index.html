 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“On second thought, I feel that I would be better off staying in the Sea King Palace.” Muyun Qingge said without hesitations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should be able to. I will help you ask the Palace Lord.” Qing Shui knew that Muyun Qingge didn’t enjoy jokes. Thus, he felt that it was wiser if he stopped teasing her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui... Di Chen, Di Qing, Yu Ruyan, Tantai Xuan, and Hai Dongqing are planning to come here. I intend to invite them to strengthen our power.” At this moment, Qing Hanye spoke up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This may sound great, but will they really come?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Initially, they have already shown some interests in coming over. But now that you are close-by, if you can convince them about it, I am sure that they will definitely come.” Qing Hanye chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t force you guys to do things which you don’t want to do. They have all got their own matters to attend to. Are you sure this is a good idea?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To be frank with you, to prepare for such occasions, they have already found heirs to take after them. In their absence, these people could help them watch over the sects. Similarly, the Sea King Palace will also slowly gather their members here. Does that sound alright to you?” asked Qing Hanye, throwing a hopeful gaze towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Certainly... before this, I have also shared this kind of thoughts. However, the main problem is that I am constantly moving here and there, and the strength each of you possessed is not enough for you to conquer the world. Thus, I believe it will be safer if you guys live somewhere more distant.” Qing Shui confessed his worries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have taken these things into considerations as well. But you may not have taken into account that Sister Jiange is very powerful. Besides that, each of us is also improving at a fast pace. That’s not all, we still have the formation which you gave us up our sleeves and most importantly, we won’t try to provoke anyone without any reasons.” Qing Hanye responded with a confident smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, in any case, in the eyes of a man, beautiful women are no different from a precious treasure. With all of you together in one place, do you really think that no one will be coming with a bad idea towards all of you?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For your information, it’s not like we can be messed around with so easily. But I will let you make the final call.” Qing Hanye passed the problem to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately started to ponder over the issue and soon, he came up with the solution, “If it is ok with you, I believe that we can get a few of them here first. But we must be careful and make sure that not too many of them come at once. We will wait until our strength has stabilized more, and we are able to stand on our own ground first. Only then can we concentrate more of our forces around this area. However, that doesn’t mean that we wouldn’t need to attend to our family matters. After spending so many years there, I believe that everyone must have built a good foundation and gotten used to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t intend to get his mother to move permanently along with them. In the future, he could visit them whenever he felt like it. Alternatively, he could also bring them here to stay for a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye nodded, “Hm, sure, why not?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After half a month, Di Chen and the others came. What surprised Qing Shui was that they had long since prepared for this day. Nevertheless, he was still very delighted to see them considering how long it had been since they last reunited with each other. It had gotten to the point where they even started finding each other’s face a bit unfamiliar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen’s eyes looked just as profound as before. Until now, she, who was once the Misty Hall Mistress, was still able to enchant people with the eyes of hers. This time, they could leave their children at home. With so many people at home and the children having grown older, they could start cultivating among themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Yehuang Guwu at the Qing Clan, Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel more relieved. And at the moment, there were also two elderlies watching over the house and guiding the younger generations through their cultivations on a regular basis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui embraced Di Chen, the woman whom he had become a bit distant with. After going through so many difficulties, their relationships had finally come to fruition. However, for most of the time, they were separated from each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen`Er, have you missed me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which part of me do you miss the most?” Qing Shui smiled and asked a mischievous question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The question which he just asked could represent a lot of meanings. Nevertheless, Di Chen hugged him tightly and answered, “Every single part of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you missed this particular part of mine?” Qing Shui whispered to her ear as he began pushing his lower hips towards her stomach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could feel a tremble across the body of the woman in his brace. As he felt the warmth of her body, he immediately leaned forward to kiss her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, you are being biased. You never bothered to kiss us when you first reunited with us, and Chen`Er is the only one who gets such a special treatment. If this already happens at the moment you guys meet each other, we couldn’t imagine how things would turn out at night.” Qing Hanye smiled as she teased the couple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed an awkward smile. It was without questions that this woman was just as mischievous as Huoyun Liu-Li. It was like if there was no outsider, then there wouldn’t be a restraint to the things which she said. In addition to that, when the two were alone together, she was able to pleasure Qing Shui just as much as the others could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui embraced Di Qing and gave her a similar kiss. After that, she moved on to do the same to Tantai Xuan, Yu Ruyan, and Hai Dongqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a question, Qing Shui enjoyed the best moment of his life at night. However, in order for that to happen, he would also be required to have a tough body. But no worries, the Nine Yang Golden Physique was the best asset Qing Shui could ever have in this regard. Therefore, instead of worrying about whether or not he could please them, his main concern should only be on whether or not he had enough time to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s kiss landed on Di Chen’s neck and moved all the way down to her bulging breasts. While his head was buried within her breasts, the movements of his hands were also causing Di Chen to constantly tremble. As he moved his hands down, he realized that the lower part of her body was already wet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that our Chen`Er may have gotten a bit out of control.” Qing Shui smiled as he whispered by her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui beside her, Di Chen could already interpret his words. Driven by embarrassment, she immediately dug her head into Qing Shui’s chest. In response to that, Qing Shui mounted her and intruded the warm, wet part of her lower body. As that happened, he began to do the exercises which every male would do with a female.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The process of migration isn’t particularly difficult but nor was it easy. The Sea King Palace was the first to move. After finding a good location, they started migrating slowly one after another. As of now, Qing Shui and the girls have resided in the Imperial Cuisine Hall of Lin Hai City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they arrived, Yin Tong and the others were also present. At the moment when Lan Lingfeng saw the girls around Qing Shui, he gave him a big thumbs up.</span></p>

It had been a long time since they last met, hence, it was only natural that they would have a lot of things to catch up on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, the Imperial Cuisine Hall had turned out to be a decent place. It was a large force. The one in Linhai City was taken charge by the Lan Clan. The Great Confucian Empire also had the one within their area under protection. Thus, no one actually dared lay a hand on the hall itself. Besides, Tian Yi was the most popular miraculous physician around here. Who could guarantee that they would stay healthy forever? Thus, it was only natural that people would want to desperately establish a close relationship with Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>

When he first noticed him, the old man was knitting his brows, but his expression soon turned happy when he saw Qing Shui, “Qing Shui! Come! You came just at the right time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Man Wen Jian was also present. Qing Shui smiled as he greeted the old man, “Hello, gramps!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, good. Qing Shui, as of now, I can sense an immeasurable amount of strength within you.” Wen Jian said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three settled down on a tea table and without further delay, the old man from the Xia Clan proceeded to say, “The old geezer of the Thousand King Empire has broken through.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thousand King Empire?” Qing Shui failed to understand what he was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All along, the old geezer has been my rival. Once he broke through, it would mean that one-fifth of the Great Confucian Empire would have to be split to them, and only a small part of the land is connected to the Thousand King Empire.” The old man of Xia Clan said in a displeased tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood it well. This was a way of putting pressure on the opponent. With them being rivals, this breakthrough was a good opportunity to demonstrate his new power to his rival. However, since it had been said that they have shared this relationship for a long time, it would mean that the Thousand King Empire wouldn’t try to take a complete advantage right away. The reason being that if one day, the opposing side grew even more tremendous, they wouldn’t hesitate to lay their hands back on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, it means nothing for me to share such a small part of a huge land, but my main concern is on my face. If I were to share it out, I would find it really disgraceful to my own name.” The old man of the Xia Clan revealed a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What will they do if we refuse to share the land?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They will send us a challenge letter. Similarly, it will be embarrassing if no one accepts it. Their main aim isn’t the land, their main aim is to embarrass the Great Confucian Empire.” The old man of the Xia Clan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, take it then. I will be the representative to fight.”</span></p>
