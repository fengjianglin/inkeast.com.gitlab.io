 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were guards at the entrance; totaling ten of them, five on each side. This was just a formality; if something happened, these few people would not be able to handle it. They could only deliver a message, or simply act as sentries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a while since Qing Shui and Beihuang Fan stood at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew the Northern Emperor Food Residence, but it was his first time here. He did not expect a food residence to be so huge. Many of his perceptions came from the past life, so he was shocked to see the scale here. He operated the Imperial Cuisine Hall and felt that it was successful. Moreover, he had opened many branches. However, he never thought that a food residence could be operated in this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan stood beside Qing Shui without a word. Qing Shui came back to reality and said with a smile, “Come, let’s go and try the dishes here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan nodded; then, both of them walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan was no ordinary person. Many people knew her. Even for those who did not, they would be stunned by her beauty. After all, those who came here had status. Thus, they were all arrogant. They had the guts to leer at beautiful women, since it was not illegal to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northern Emperor Residence Park!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northern Emperor Residence Park was the most classy part of the Northern Emperor Food Residence. The dishes here were the most delicious and expensive. It was a symbol of status to be there. The chefs working there were the best of the best. The chefs who made the dishes here were very famous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, there were more female chefs than male chefs. Unlike the past life, the women could not even move a cooking pot. It was different here; the women had more strengths than most men in the past life. This was the genuine difference in body constitutions. The women who had a little cultivation here were far ahead compared to the martial art practitioners in the past life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the journey, they gained a lot of attention because Beihuang Fan’s beauty was attracting everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui expected it. Besides, Qing Shui knew that the person in charge of the Northern Emperor Food Residence was aware of their presence. That was Qing Shui’s intention, to let them search for him. They would probably do so as everybody acknowledged everything now anyway. From the moment Qing Shui stepped into this place, it was obvious that both sides had already known about the situation well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, please show us your VIP card.” They were blocked as they were entering the main hall at Northern Emperor Residence Park.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not expect that he would need a VIP card. Qing Shui was just about to ask this guy to call upon the manager of Northern Emperor Food Residence before Beihuang Fan took out a card and waved. Then, they made their way in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised to see that Beihuang Fan had a VIP card. That was great, as they saved themselves some trouble. Otherwise, if Qing Shui had beaten up the guards, the rest would come out afterward. Thankfully, it had yet to reach that stage and he did not want things to escalate to that level now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he initiated the fight, he would lose some reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a main hall and reserved rooms here. The biggest specialty was the huge space. It appeared very pleasing to the eyes. Many people were eating; the dishes on the tables gave out an enticing fragrance. Besides being aromatic, they looked very appetizing as well. The dishes were extremely delicate, equally good in color, aroma, and taste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Beihuang Fan found a rather quiet place and sat down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as they were seated, the staff approached them instantly, “What would you like to order?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She handed over a menu to Qing Shui and Beihuang Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not here to eat, so he ordered some signature dishes right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please wait for a moment!” The beautiful waitress said while bending over. Then, she left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the main hall, but it was neither the cheapest spot in the main hall, nor the more classy places like the reserved rooms. There was some distance between each table. Martial arts were highly regarded in this world. People were more bold and frank. Thus, many people were used to sitting in the main hall. They could probably make some friends here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From time to time, somebody would look at Qing Shui. Those who knew him would look at him, those who did not know him would do the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, a man walked over, “Hi, Miraculous Physician Qing, I’m here to thank you. You cured my son’s white smoke disease.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “You’re welcome. Unfortunately, there were too many patients so I really can’t remember your son specifically.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man thanked him again and called upon the waitress on his way back. He said something to the waitress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, the dishes were served on Qing Shui’s table. Qing Shui and Beihuang Fan dug in. The dishes were really not bad. Though it was not comparable to Qing Shui’s dishes, they were very good. Beihuang Fan took one bite and said, “It is so much different from those you make.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want to catch a woman’s heart, you have to catch her stomach. Our forefathers didn’t lie,” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that exact moment, the waitress came and served the most pricy dish available. It was a treat from that previous man, she said. As Qing Shui turned to look back at where the man was, he had already left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Beihuang, long time no see!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A voice was heard at that time. Qing Shui was a bit pissed off after hearing that voice. It was rather frivolous. Qing Shui raised his head to look at the person who spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a young man wearing a white robe and holding a folded fan. He was handsome; his eyes were as bright as stars, his face was as clear as jade. He was indeed a pretty boy, much better looking than the pretty boys in the past life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging from his tone, this man knew Beihuang Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan showed no response upon seeing this man. She raised her head and took a glance at him and asked, “Yes?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is? Are you not going to introduce him to me?” The man was very good-looking, but his attitude made people uneasy. That kind of superiority was slightly annoying. However, it depended on who he was dealing with. If it was someone who was greater, Qing Shui was willing to accept that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would not feel anything different regardless of the opponent’s status. Hence, it was amusing to see this narcissistic and cocky man. At least, it was amusing in Qing Shui’s view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No,” Beihuang Fan replied emotionlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man seemed not surprised to hear that from Beihuang Fan. He smiled and looked at Qing Shui, “I’m Bei Tengyun. How do I address you, sir?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bei Tengyun, apparently this Northern Emperor Food Residence belongs to your family.” Qing Shui looked at this man; he was quite certain. Plus, this man’s surname was Bei, he should be one of the Bei clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Emperor Food Residence was founded by the Bei clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed!” Bei Tengyun replied in an authoritative tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, you will know who I am when you call your dad here,” Qing Shui replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Tengyun’s expression changed after listening to Qing Shui. That was looking down on him. How dared he? Moreover, it was a young man. Not only that, this wasn’t the first person to look down on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first one was Beihuang Fan, but she was a woman. Plus, she was an extremely beautiful woman. Thus, he ignored it and did not feel much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, this time, the person who looked down at him was a young man. Furthermore, he stood beside Beihuang Fan. Bei Tengyun was hostile to Qing Shui initially; his hostility grew more now. His face uncontrollably turned ugly as he said, “A young man shouldn’t be too arrogant even if he is capable. You have to know that your abilities are insignificant to others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “It seems like you know me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Tengyun knew him for sure. He did not expect to touch on this issue himself now. If he admitted, he would appear to have been hypocritical previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How are my dishes here? Do they suit your taste ?” Bei Tengyun said something irrelevant.</span></p>
