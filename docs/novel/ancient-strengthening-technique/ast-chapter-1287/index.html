 <p><strong>AST 1287 - Lu Zitai, Divine Beast Possession, Poisonous Python King</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that a day like this would come. After all, he killed the man with the surname Lu back then. The surname Lu was one of the most influential surnames in the Desolate Sect. Furthermore, the sect lord of the Desolate Sect also had the surname Lu.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui circulated a magical strength around his body and immediately removed the Spiritual Sense locked onto him. This way, he felt that it shouldn’t be a problem for him to finish his meal</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was being locked on by a Spiritual Sense. After repeated thoughts, the only conclusion he came up with was it was done by the man with the surname Lu which he killed. The person marked a seal on his body. This seal was something which only one could put in exchange for their life and the Desolate Sect had their own unique way to track Qing Shui through this seal.</p>
 <p>After he separated away from the Spiritual Sense, it would take a bit of time if the opponents wanted to lock onto him again. These kind of seals that exchanged for the user’s life weren’t something which could be removed away easily. It was a kind of inheritance seal. However, this was Qing Shui we were talking about. If it had been someone else, it was likely that they would have been disrupted by the mark. Similar to being possessed by a demon, they wouldn’t be able to find peace in their mind. Considering that Qing Shui had powerful spirit energy, he wasn’t in the least influenced by it.</p>
 <p>Just like this, the three of them happily finished their meal. After that, they walked out of the room and arrived at the courtyard. At that moment, they saw more than ten black spots spiraling around from far away in the distance and when they came out, the black dots seemed to be flying towards them.</p>
 <p>At that instant when Qing Shui came out, he was able to once again notice the Spiritual Sense which was locked onto him. He looked at the two girls, “Go back to your room or just stay here and rest.”</p>
 <p>At the moment when he finished speaking, he immediately soared up into the sky and appeared in mid-air. After that, he tried his best to distance himself away from the manor. The two girls, on the other hand, stayed down there and didn’t leave nor followed him.</p>
 <p>The sun was now already at three poles high. The air was really fresh and the weather was clear and bright. However, because more than ten demonic beasts had appeared and covered the sky, it somehow felt a bit gloomy. It was as if black clouds have covered the sky.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui roughly analyzed these people with his eyes. He could confirm that they were from the Desolate Sect as they all wore the same attire. All of them had looks of ordinary people and seemed that they didn’t share any traits from the Beast Blood Tribes.</p>
 <p>At this moment, three old men came out. They all had very majestic appearances and looked a bit domineering and intimidating. Once someone achieved this kind of strength, they would naturally exude a kind of capable appearance from time to time. Very few would actually look like bad people. There was no clear distinction between good and bad people, nor was there on justice and evil in the world. The winner would always be the king and no one would really show concern on which sects a particular place belonged to or who was the royal clan in it. The only thing which they cared about was whether the particular sect or royal clan would be able to bring about a healthy living environment for them.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? Why do you want to kill my people from the Desolate Sect?” The old man in the middle had chilly eyes and his body was straight like a pen. The thin and dry body of his looked really slender, yet it gave people a feeling of danger just like a poisonous arrow.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know anything about the Desolate Sect. I have killed countless people. Besides, I have no interest in questioning those who deserved to die who they are.” Qing Shui said so to purposely anger the old man.</p>
 <p>“Impressive. Brat, you are quite arrogant. Do you really think that you can do anything you want just because you are a disciple of the Heaven Secret Academy? What a joke. Even if you are the Palace Lord of the Heaven Secret Academy, I wouldn’t hesitate to kill you.” The old man didn’t hesitate to speak.</p>
 <p>Everything was now clear to Qing Shui, the Desolate Sect was planning to make a huge deal of the incident this time. Furthermore, they also planned to dissect the Heaven Secrets Academy. However, one thing which puzzled him was that was Desolate Sect really this strong?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and he looked at the old man. “So you are even going to kill the Palace Lord of the Heaven Secrets Academy. Do you really think that that 8,000 sun worth of strength of yours is truly an unbeatable existence?”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Qing Shui’s words, a trace of surprised look flashed across the old man’s eyes. He locked his sight at Qing Shui. “I don’t know where you find out about my strength. Even though 8,000 sun worth of strength isn’t considered the strongest in the Western Oxhe Continent, it’s more than enough to deal with you. The strength of the Heaven Secrets Academy is inferior to mine, let alone there are still people even stronger than me within the Desolate Sect.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected that the Great Desolate Sect actually think highly of him. It might be that they wanted to put pressure on the Heaven Secrets Academy. The other two old men, on the other hand, had a strength of around 7,000 sun.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Qing Shui still didn’t feel scared but he knew that he couldn’t let his guard down. His demonic beasts could only be able to barely fight against the three old men. Although, Qing Shui still felt a bit confident, he would have to fight a prolonged battle.</p>
 <p>“It’s already been said that the Desolate Sect plans to conquer the entire Western Oxhe Continent. It seems like this time, they are going to start their assault from Heaven Secrets Academy… However...it’s pretty sad…..” Qing Shui shook his head and said.</p>
 <p>“Huh, what’s there to be sad about?” The old man seemed really shocked by the fact that Qing Shui was aware of the Desolate Sect’s intention.</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, the Desolate Sect is too stupid.”</p>
 <p>“Little brat, we will first start off with you today.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing what Qing Shui said, the old man stopped saying anything and immediately charged towards Qing Shui. He held a jet-black colored Snake Spear Staff in his hand and traces of sinister aura could be felt from it. While it was being wielded by the old man, it somehow resembled a hissing snake.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui calmly avoided the attacks. The old man was powerful, he didn’t want to go head to head against him for now. Now that he had the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, it was fairly easy for him to dodge the attacks while he used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dodged the attacks and at the same time, a frightened look flashed across the old man’s eyes. However, Qing Shui immediately proceeded to summon the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Since they were fighting, they should fight more thoroughly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was aware that both he and the Desolate Sect would undoubtedly incur hostility with each other. Since that was the case, he felt that he should make it even more dramatic.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon! Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Fire Bird!</p>
 <p>Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider!</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swung his hand and summoned his demonic beasts. After being weakened, the old man in the middle was only left with a strength which was not more than 6,000 sun. The other two old men on the other hand, only had 5,000 sun of strength remaining. As for the rest of them, their strength was even more unbearable. Before they managed to realize the huge gap in strength, Qing Shui already unleashed attacks along with his demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Seals of Roc right off the bat.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, he didn’t meet the chances to double his attack prowess. Despite this, he still managed to push back the old man in the middle with around 6,000 sun worth of strength.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant on the other hand, cooperated with him and used the Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp. After that, it followed on by using the Diamond Sword Qi.</p>
 <p>The Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider summoned its army to quickly hunt down the people in the surrounding. The speed at which it hunted for its preys gave the three old men an urge to spit out blood. Those people were all their elites.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast, on the other hand, used its Thunderbolt to attack the three old men from far away. Qing Shui was keeping one of them occupied whereas the Thunderous Beast tried to bother the weakest old man among the three. The Fire Bird and Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant on the other hand, made their way towards the last remaining old man. The Fire Bird had a terrifying resistance against attacks. Even without any weakening effects, the old man in the middle was unable to kill the Fire Bird within a short period of time.</p>
 <p>All of these may have happened very suddenly, but the impact brought upon to the people from the Desolate Sect was something that would never disappear. In fact, half of the people there had already disappeared even before they managed to feel completely shaken.</p>
 <p>As the battle started, Qing Shui realized that he, along with his demonic beasts, didn’t really feel pressured when facing off against the people from the Desolate Sect even though three of them had a strength ranging from 7,000 sun to 8,000 sun.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he was still yet to absorb the feedback of strength provided by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. If he had absorbed it, Qing Shui would have been able to completely diminish his opponents with no effort at all.</p>
 <p>In just a short while, only the three old men remained. After all, with the strength possessed by those people, it was quite easy for the Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider to play them to death. They were all killed as a result of being corroded by the poison produced by the spider.</p>
 <p>“I am Lu Zitai. Let’s make a deal with each other. How does it sound?”</p>
 <p>The old man in the middle was aware that he would die if the battle went on. Qing Shui at the same time also felt upset. He had cast the Seal of Roc fifteen times, but none of it met the chances to double their attack prowess. When he heard what the old man had said, he immediately revealed a cold smile. “Really, you guys only learn to talk when you are on the brink of death. If you are telling me to let you guys live, there is no place for negotiation.”</p>
 <p>“I feel it is beneath my dignity to actually beg someone for mercy. It’s just that before I die, can you please answer a few of my questions?” The old man asked firmly.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so you are waiting for the reinforcement team?” Qing Shui knitted his brows and looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>“Eh, you are aware that we have called out to other people?”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense, do you guys really think that the Heaven Secret Academy will be disrupted by an insignificant people like you? The only things you guys will disrupt are the sects nearby here.” Qing Shui looked at them like he was looking at some sort of idiots.</p>
 <p>“Hah, it seems we have an awful start. Originally, I was thinking about taking down one of the sects here and make it our hideout. It seems this plan is not going to work after all.” Lu Zitai let out a sigh. He had already lost his fighting spirit.</p>
 <p>Ah!</p>
 <p>One of the weakest old men continuously got struck by repeated waves of Violet Lightning Strike and died. In the end, he had only managed let out a short, tragic scream.</p>
 <p>“Young man, you are a formidable foe. In terms of your talent, you aren’t in the least inferior to our young master. You must die.”</p>
 <p>Divine Beast Possession!</p>
 <p>The old man suddenly lets out a loud scream.</p>
 <p>The initially thin and light old man immediately grew taller by one meter. His body and beard were like green pines. His entire body was dyed with black color. He was being wrapped around by a black snake. With its huge and black head higher up in the sky, it was observing everything happening from below.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui once again broaden his horizon. It seemed that there were definitely strong warriors among the barbarians. Furthermore, it was likely that the body of the people from the Desolate Sect had bloodlines that belonged to the Beast Blood Tribe.</p>
 <p>“The Divine Beast Possession was a paragon owned by the Desolate Sect and the barbarians. They completely awaken the beast’s shape of the Demonic Beasts Armor Manifestation. Only the members of the Desolate Sect and core members of the Beast Blood Tribes were allowed to learn it. But upon usage, they will become weak for a month. Today, I am going to show you how terrifying the Divine Beast Possession was.” The old man was now already in a position where he had nowhere else to go. Hence, the only thing on his mind was to kill Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Even now, Qing Shui was a bit startled. The old man and the enormous black snake had actually merged into one. Its overall strength immediately went through a significant increase. It increased from the original strength of around 6,000 sun from before all the way up to 11,000 sun.</p>
 <p>The Divine Beast Possession was such a violent technique. However, Qing Shui figured out that it might be related to the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. At the moment, the old man’s body was really powerful. It was as if his entire being was stuck on the body of the enormous black python. A substance which looked just like black fog started to spread out around the surroundings. Upon smelling it, a person would feel dizzy and confused.</p>
 <p>Poisonous Python King!</p>
 <p>No wonder it was so violent! However, Qing Shui still had a fairly powerful resistance towards toxic substances. He immediately let out his Area Dominance.</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>A ray of white and pure aura started to spread out around Qing Shui, with him being the core of it. Upon meeting the black colored dense fog, they immediately disappeared together. However, what shocked Qing Shui was that the black dense fog was incomparably violent. To his surprise, it had actually slowly diminished the white dense fog released by his Area Dominance. Qing Shui’s Area Dominance was at a fairly low grade, despite this, it was still capable of resisting against poison. This was the first time such thing happened. This could only show that the opponent’s poison was too powerful.</p>
 <p>The toxic substance stopped at about two meters around Qing Shui’s body and was no longer able to progress forward. The Nature Energy around Qing Shui’s body was not something which could be diminished so easily.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, you indeed have a lot of treasures with you. But today, it’s certain that you would die!”</p>
 <p>Whirlwind Strike!</p>
 <p>The enormous Poisonous Python King approached Qing Shui like a tornado. Layers of poisonous liquid could be seen appearing across its entire body. They spiraled along with the Poisonous Python King to help raise its prowess. Even Qing Shui himself felt numbness in his scalp upon seeing such scene.</p>
 <p>Poison, they were poisonous. Despite this, Qing Shui didn’t dare to make any counterattack because that familiar Spiritual Sense had once again locked itself onto him. Previously, it was precisely the Spiritual Sense from this thing which he was being locked onto.</p>
