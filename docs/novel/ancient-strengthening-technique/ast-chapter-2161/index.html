 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was just about to make her move when she suddenly got stopped by Qing Shui. Carrying her, Qing Shui effortlessly dodged the attack with an unusual movement. This was the Minute Subtlety. By now, Qing Shui was able to pull off the Minute Subtlety at a very proficient level. He happened to be able to dodge right to the gaps of the attacks. Following on, he unleashed his ultimate attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stellar Transposition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A violet gold shadow which resembled both a staff and a whip immediately struck towards the man in black gown. However, what happened right after shocked Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud and clear noise came through. Upon being struck by his attack, the man vanished and left nothing behind. Not even his aura could be sensed in the air, nor was there any trace of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, Tantai Lingyan was also shocked by what she saw. What a formidable attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very quickly, Qing Shui recovered from his shock and came to understand what had just happened. Despite the man being very powerful, Qing Shui managed to unleash an attack that was almost an equivalent to his defensive prowess thanks to the Stellar Transposition. Needless to say, Qing Shui’s current defensive prowess had broken through the bottleneck, 50 million Dao Force. Most importantly, the attack, Stellar Transposition was an attack which didn’t take the opponent’s defense into account. It was within expectations that the opponent would burst from being whipped by the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all of that done, Qing Shui had finally authenticated his own strength. His current defensive prowess, the Divine Weapons, Emperor Qi, as well as his ability to set up formations had all gone up by one notch. Thinking about this, Qing Shui got agitated. Very soon, he would no longer need to be afraid of anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attack of Stellar Transposition completely ignored the opponent’s defense. Not only so, but it also had 100% accuracy. However, there was a distance to which its attack could take effect. If the opponent went beyond the distance where Stellar Transposition could reach, the technique would become useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, there were times when even the 100% accuracy would fail to work. This was a normal occurrence as nothing was absolute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan went back after buying some stuff. Initially, Qing Shui had wanted to shop around the night market with Tantai Lingyan. But due to the incident, he lost his mood to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui told Nuo Lan about this so that she could investigate who was behind this. Other than Demons Gate, Qing Shui didn’t know who else he offended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The things about Qing Shui — the Battle God and Tantai Lingyan — the Demon Lord was still spreading around the entire city. It was not unusual for people to talk about them, and since he couldn’t control what other people talked about, he chose to overlook it. So long as the Golden Battle God didn’t speak out, no one would be able to kick him out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Beihuang Yu came. This time, Beihuang Yu didn’t reveal any expressions when he yelled out, “It’s time to drink some wine!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “Sure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh yes, I remember you mentioned that you have very beautiful wives before. I never thought that it would be true.” Beihuang Yu mentioned it while smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui prepared some dishes in his room. Meanwhile, Tantai Lingyan also came out. She looked at Qing Shui after seeing Beihuang Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lingyan, I would like to introduce you to one of my close friends and also my brother-like figure. But for now, we have yet to decide who will be the elder one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice to meet you, auntie, It will be more convenient for me to call you aunt for now.” Beihuang Yu said in an unsure tone, not knowing if he should feel upset or happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might be the Palace Lord of Taiyi Immortal Palace and had outstanding talents, but he knew that he mustn’t get his positions mixed up. Somehow, he had a feeling that there was a high chance Qing Shui would eventually become his uncle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice to meet you!” Tantai Lingyan responded in a calm tone. She didn’t seem to feel uncomfortable being called an aunt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed an awkward smile, “You should know better than anyone else that it is impossible for your aunt to want to be with me. Please don’t overthink things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought back to the times when he kept getting beaten up. But despite all that, there was no denying that he did gain some benefits from it. After all, he was the only person who had managed to climbed onto the woman whom no one had even been able to interact with. Of course, this also came with a price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It has been so many years, and you are the first man whom my aunt is eager to meet. Hehe, besides, my aunt is the most beautiful woman in Northern Emperor Domain. Can you guarantee me a hundred percent that you won’t lay your hands on her?” Beihuang Yu chuckled and shot a gaze at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Somehow, I have a feeling that you are trying to cause trouble to your aunt.” Qing Shui found it really absurd for this brat to be advertising his own aunt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Men understand men well. Despite having so many wives, you are a responsible man. I can tell that no one other than you are qualified enough to be with my aunt.” Beihuang Yu said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Putting this aside for now, Lingyan, please don’t be mad.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if Beihuang Yu had just realized that Tantai Lingyan was Qing Shui’s woman when he revealed an awkward smile, “Auntie, I am not trying to be rude, but I am starting to realize that all the beautiful women seem to be related to him in some ways.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, she moved her sight onto Qing Shui, staring at him thoughtfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, let’s get straight to the point. Is there anything which I can help you with?” Qing Shui asked straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My aunt heard that your wife is here. She said that she would like to come and visit. I came here just to inform you about it.” Beihuang Yu ate a mouthful of vegetable and said with his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t express much reactions to the news that Beihuang Fan was coming. He shot a glance at Beihuang Yu, “What’s about it? Are you afraid that she might lay her hands on me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nah, I fear that my aunt may have recognized your wife as her enemy.” Beihuang Yu said in an awkward tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After giving it a few thoughts, Qing Shui realized that it was not unusual if things like this happened. Beihuang Fan was a member of Taiyi Immortal Palace. The Taiyi Immortal Palace was sworn-enemies with Demon Lord Inheritors, and Tantai Lingyan, no matter how hard she tried, could never escape the fact that she was not only a Demon Lord Inheritor, but also an actual Demon Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, Qing Shui realized that he didn’t actually understand her well. What exactly was this Demon Lord? How much of this energy still resided within her body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, Qing Shui lifted up his head and looked towards the staircase, only to see a bright figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the similar Goddess Divine Set, the same eyes that were calm as a pond, and also the same face which could bring about catastrophes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the two women came face to face with each other, they firmly fixed their sights on one another. Sensing something weird, Qing Shui stood up immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are a Demon Lord Inheritor. If you really love him, leave him.” Not beating around the bush, Beihuang Fan directly said her thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Beihuang Fan! That’s enough!” Qing Shui knitted his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, Beihuang Fan didn’t even bother to bat an eye on him. Her sight was fixed on Tantai Lingyan, “Stay behind if you want to destroy him. You possess formidable Demon Lord’s Blood in your body. Do you really think that Qing Shui has successfully purified all of the Demon Lord’s Blood in your body? When the time comes, you are destined to be the most powerful Demon Lord. To be truthful with you, even at this very moment, I am feeling a strong urge to kill you, knowing that you will eventually turn out to be one of the greatest demons in the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui got a bit anxious. He didn’t know how Beihuang Fan found out about it. Even Qing Shui only noticed this recently. At one point, he once purified the Demon Lord’s Blood and got reborn, enabling him to become stronger than ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan trembled. She felt like a voice was summoning her, demanding her to return to it so that it could bring her to a certain place. When she arrived there, she would become an expert warrior. Once that happened, she would finally be able to avenge her parents and did the things that she wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw Tantai Lingyan’s expression, he knew that something was up and intended to go and stop her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right at this moment, Tantai Lingyan smiled. At that instant, it felt as if an iceberg had thawed. She looked at Qing Shui, “Qing Shui, no matter how things turn out in the future, I will never forget about you. You are the only man whom I ever love. But deep down within my heart, I feel like I am always being guided to a certain place. There, I may be able to find the things which my parents have left behind for me. And now, I finally have the opportunity to go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will come back, and I will look for you again. Qing Shui, I think this is where we part ways for now. But I assure you that I will be fine!” At the moment she finished speaking, she took out a unique stone and crushed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a thing left behind by her parents for her. Before giving it to her, they reminded her to only use it once she was able to sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant it broke, her entire figure got surrounded by a green light. It resembled a Teleportation Seal. Tantai Lingyan shot a gaze at Qing Shui, her eyes showing that she missed him, causing Qing Shui to feel bad. After waving her hand for a while, she disappeared.</span></p>
