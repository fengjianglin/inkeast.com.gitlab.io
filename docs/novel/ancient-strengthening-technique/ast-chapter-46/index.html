  <p><strong>Ancient Strengthening Technique: Chapter 46 – Circumstances of Qing Shui’s Birth (1)</strong></p>
  <p>“Hmm, if that is so, could Grandpa give me a Crippling Divine Pill?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s request had almost given Qing Luo a heart attack. Complex emotions surfaced in his eyes as he faced Qing Shui. “You should already know about the effects of the Crippling Divine Pill. The current you could be considered to have a bright and almost limitless potential, so there is no need for you to even think about this pill at all.”</p>
  <p>“Yup, Shui`er, your grandpa is right. You must not be tempted by the sudden increase in strength and bury all of your future potential!” Qing Yi barely recovered from the shock of Qing Shui’s request, as she hurriedly tried to persuade Qing Shui, hoping to change his mind. After all, it was her who told Qing Shui about the effects of the Crippling Divine Pill.</p>
  <p>A bitterness arose in Qing Shui’s heart. His own future potential was limitless, but the current him was still stuck at the damnable bottleneck, sorely unable to make a breakthrough! That step through the doorway of the 4th heavenly layer, had evaded him for six years… a whole six years !</p>
  <p>“I understand, Grandpa, Mother, please rest assured, I will not do anything to damage my potential.” Qing Shui exhibited a reassuring smile, for only he alone understood the helplessness that he felt.</p>
  <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s constant reassurance, both Qing Luo and Qing Yi slightly relaxed, but had not given up on repeatedly reminding him about the harmful effects of the Crippling Divine Pill again and again.</p>
  <p>Unknowingly, Qing Shui already stood at the pinnacle of the 3rd generation, and had become the dazzling star of the Qing Clan. Everyone with the exception of Qing Shui himself, was enamored of him and his future achievements. Qing Shui did not like to be out in the limelight, exposing his abilities so soon. After all, could his current abilities really be compared to the truly monstrous cultivators of the continent? It was just that Situ Bu Fan was seriously too annoying, and for the sake of the Qing Clan’s future, he had no choice but to enter the arena. However, aside from this Qing Shui had another reason hidden deep within his heart.</p>
  <p>“Because that damnable Situ Bu Fan is the fiancee of Shi Qing Zhuang! Just thinking about it makes me uncomfortable. If I’m uncomfortable, then of course I must let it all out, only then would I feel better!” Thinking of this, Qing Shui softly sighed. He did not know why exactly Shi Qing Zhuang kept appearing in his mind.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gently shook his head, trying to clear all the distracting thoughts. The thought of Situ Bu Fan tainting the ice cold beauty was enough to send his emotions spiralling out of control as blazing waves of fiery anger overtook him. Strength, and power. This were the only two things that mattered in the world of the nine continents. With sufficient strength, he could do as he wishes, and even snatch those who took his fancy.</p>
  <p>As Qing Shui was lost in his thoughts, Qing Luo took out a sealed box and passed it over to Qing Shui. “Since you are so adamant about this, Grandpa shall grant your wish… but Qing Shui, you must promise me that you would never, ever, under any circumstances consume this pill. For if you do, any hopes of you reaching the Xiantian realm would vanish into the thin air just like a puff of smoke. Your mother and I are both looking forward to your future progression. Bear this in mind alright.”</p>
  <p>Even at this moment, Qing Luo was still preaching to Qing Shui about the dangers of the Crippling Divine Pill. He feared that Qing Shui would feel that the realm of Xiantian was too difficult to reach. Also, if in the future there was any powers that provoked or humiliated him, Qing Shui may because of a moment of impulse, consume the crippling divine pill and thus, bury his potential.</p>
  <p>After all, the coming of age ceremony had already concluded, and Qing Shui was no longer a boy, but officially considered an adult man. Qing Luo believed that he would be able to think things through and make the right decisions. No matter what, a man was entitled to a few secrets and as such, Qing Luo did not question Qing Shui on the reason behind him wanting the Crippling Divine Pill. “Sigh, if only I knew that he would make such a request…” Qing Luo shook his head. If he knew that Qing Shui wanted the Crippling Divine Pill, he would not have been so bold to suggest that Qing Shui could have any item he wanted in the Qing Clan’s treasury!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui expressed his gratitude after receiving the sealed box. Then he noticed Qing You was red in the face, seemingly wanting to say something, but he had not spoken for fear of interrupting them earlier.</p>
  <p>“Grandpa………” After the word resounded out, there was no other sound for a long moment.</p>
  <p>Qing Luo smiled, his favorite grandson was Qing You from when he was a child, thus how could he not know what Qing You was thinking about? Everytime he wanted something, Qing You exhibited this particular expression on his face. Qing Luo just received six 100-Year Fiery Power Fruits, and Qing You had that expression on his face. How could Qing Luo not put two and two together?</p>
  <p>“Hahaha, kid, I know you want the 100-Year Fiery Power Fruit. Giving two to you is not out of the question, but you must promise me that you will strive and work hard. In addition, after increasing your strength, you cannot wantonly challenge others to show off your might. If you want to challenge someone, then challenge your brother Qing Shui.” After saying that, Qing Luo took out two of the 100-Year Fiery Power Fruits and tossed them over to Qing You.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Qing Yi happily watched as the visibly excited Qing You kept the fruits. In this moment, one could see a mixture of surprise, joy, sincerity and gratitude towards Qing Yi from the eyes of Qing You.</p>
  <p>Afterwards, the three of them departed and Qing You excitedly stated, “Aunty, Brother Qing Shui, I shall go now and increase my strength. I will meet you afterwards.” He didn’t even wait for their replies before turning around and dashing away at full speed.</p>
  <p>Looking at the fervor displayed by Qing You, Qing Yi laughed and told Qing Shui, “Your little cousin Qing You won’t be able to sleep in peace for a few days. He is too excited.”</p>
  <p>“Hehe, indeed. In this cultivation-oriented world, how would there be anything more joyful than a massive surge in strength?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p>After returning back to their residence, Qing Shui decided to open the sealed box for a look at the infamous Crippling Divine Pill. Inside the box lay a small white bottle the size of a palm. Just as Qing Shui wanted to open it, he was stopped by Qing Yi.</p>
  <p>“Do not recklessly open it Shui`er, or the efficaciousness of the pill would be lost after the time it takes to brew a cup of tea.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stopped his actions, “Hmm, is just taking a look forbidden?” Qing Shui really wanted to know how this infamous pill looked like.</p>
  <p>“No.” Qing Yi said, certainty apparent in her tone.</p>
  <p>Ah forget it, since he was unable to peer at the pill, he might as well just pack it up. Today was the 15th day of the month. It was the date for the Lantern Festival in his previous world. Games such as guessing the lantern riddles were not popular in the world of the nine continents, but the whole village was still extremely lively, bustling with noise and excitement. People were everywhere, it was as if everyone who lived in the Qing Village, were out in the streets strolling about, enjoying the festive atmosphere of the Lantern Festival Day.</p>
  <p>“Mother, it is so lively out there, let us not remain cooped up in here.” Qing Shui wanted to make good use of his time and enjoy the festive mood together with Qing Yi. After all, such opportunities were rare for the both of them.</p>
  <p>“Okay!” Qing Yi happily agreed.</p>
  <p>In the end, like during the new year, both Qing Shui and Qing Yi decided to go to the Town of the Setting Phoenix. The only difference this time around was that everyone was staring at Qing Shui, and even quite a few others greeted him!</p>
  <p>Especially for those of the younger age groups. Strength in this world, was akin to riches in his previous world in terms of status. Qing Shui was considered to be “extremely wealthy” in the eyes of these youths.</p>
  <p>What made Qing Shui smile wryly, was that there was plenty of good looking beauties, who out of their own volition, went forward to introduce themselves to Qing Shui, leaving him flustered and looking for places to hide. This could not be blamed on him as it was his first experience in both of his lifetimes to have beautiful girls asking him out.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, look, there is a ravishing beauty right there, stealing glances at you.” Qing Yi happily teased Qing Shui as she pointed her finger off in a certain direction.</p>
  <p>After Qing Shui followed the finger, his gaze landed on a five to six year old little girl, whose exquisite features seemed to be carved from jade, as beautiful as a doll. The little girl was currently curiously staring at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Oh, a beauty indeed, but only after another 20 years.” Qing Shui laughed, as he gently smiled at the little girl. (TL: the pedo reference is strong in this one.)</p>
  <p>When they returned back to the Qing Clan, it was already approaching dusk. The sun slowly set, as it dyed the whole land with a dull reddish color. Both mother and son were chatting as they sat on some chairs placed in their courtyard.</p>
  <p>After some moments, Qing Shui decided that it was time to get the answers Qing Yi promised him earlier.</p>
  <p>“Mother, you once promised this to me. Can you tell me matters of the past now? Especially, about my father?” Qing Shui usually gentle tone of voice hardened perceptibly into something steel-like despite him trying to mask it.</p>

 <p>In the end, like during the new year, both Qing Shui and Qing Yi decided to go to the Town of the Setting Phoenix. The only difference this time around was that everyone was staring at Qing Shui, and even quite a few others greeted him!</p>
 <p>Especially for those of the younger age groups. Strength in this world, was akin to riches in his previous world in terms of status. Qing Shui was considered to be “extremely wealthy” in the eyes of these youths.</p>
 <p>What made Qing Shui smile wryly, was that there was plenty of good looking beauties, who out of their own volition, went forward to introduce themselves to Qing Shui, leaving him flustered and looking for places to hide. This could not be blamed on him as it was his first experience in both of his lifetimes to have beautiful girls asking him out.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, look, there is a ravishing beauty right there, stealing glances at you.” Qing Yi happily teased Qing Shui as she pointed her finger off in a certain direction.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui followed the finger, his gaze landed on a five to six year old little girl, whose exquisite features seemed to be carved from jade, as beautiful as a doll. The little girl was currently curiously staring at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh, a beauty indeed, but only after another 20 years.” Qing Shui laughed, as he gently smiled at the little girl. (TL: the pedo reference is strong in this one.)</p>
 <p>When they returned back to the Qing Clan, it was already approaching dusk. The sun slowly set, as it dyed the whole land with a dull reddish color. Both mother and son were chatting as they sat on some chairs placed in their courtyard.</p>
 <p>After some moments, Qing Shui decided that it was time to get the answers Qing Yi promised him earlier.</p>
 <p>“Mother, you once promised this to me. Can you tell me matters of the past now? Especially, about my father?” Qing Shui usually gentle tone of voice hardened perceptibly into something steel-like despite him trying to mask it.</p>
