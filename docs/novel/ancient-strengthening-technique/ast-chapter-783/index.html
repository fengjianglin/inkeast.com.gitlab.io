 <p><strong>AST 783 - Comprehending the Sword in the Southern Sea, Focus on the Concentration</strong></p>
 <p>Looking at the smooth rock surface, streams of waves attacked, causing him to feel happy. He was especially satisfied with the geographical area here and the sounds of crashing waves against the stone surface was extremely loud.</p>
 <p>There were only loud sounds of waves crashing against the shores here. Looking at the huge waves that were hundreds of meters tall, he felt that the overwhelming aura made him breathless. Qing Shui took out the Big Dipper Sword and gradually walked downward.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly walked into the sea. The cooling seawater caused his consciousness to be more agile. He slowly circulated his energies, working on attaining a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Brandishing the sword!</p>
 <p>Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Big Dipper Sword waved out, unleashing a simple but powerful wave of sword Qi, lashing it out toward the huge wave that was coming in his direction!</p>
 <p>Boom boom...</p>
 <p>A series of deep sounds rang out. Qing Shui was pushed back by the backlash of the force from the Sword of the Fifth Wave. Although he was not injured, he appeared to be all messed up. The power of nature was boundless.</p>
 <p>After getting up, Qing Shui gave it some thought and once again headed down. What followed was him being pushed back time and time again. Qing Shui had tried tempering his body under a waterfall and his body was undoubtedly strong. However, before great power, he still appeared to be slightly feeble.</p>
 <p>Thrown back time and time again, standing up time and time again. Each time Qing Shui was thrown back, he would gain something. To be able to use the Wave Essence properly, he must be able to feel it.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when Qing Shui heard about the Southern Sea, he suddenly thought of this idea. When he had gone to the Jade Sea Country in Jade Sea Country previously, it was an inland sea. It was generally hard to find such a great and suitable place.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui appreciated the force from the huge waves and then slowly contemplated. He then tried repeatedly until the moon hung high up in the sky before he retreated to the pine forest at the top of the mountain.</p>
 <p>Entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Each time he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui would feel a strong sense of satisfaction. This was a place that was not known to others, a place that was absolutely safe. Everything here belonged to him. There were many heavenly and earthly treasures and no matter which area of the realm he went to, he would feel safe. Moreover, there were a bunch of powerful demonic beasts following him.</p>
 <p>He had quite a number of new additions to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal but for some items, there were too few. Therefore, he had not been able to store that many. The Peach of Immortality and Vermillion Fruit were two examples.</p>
 <p>The 1,000-year Gloomy Wood was already at the height of a person and was growing up strong. When he walked near, he would feel a faint cooling force. It was not tall, but gave one the feeling of sturdiness and power.</p>
 <p>Wood which was yin in nature... Qing Shui still didn't know what it could be use for. For forging treasures, when one had gloomy wood, demonic beasts' cores, and treasures which were either many years of age or had extreme attributes would bring about some changes to forge a treasure. Qing Shui was not very sure about the success rate.</p>
 <p>However, thinking about it, the chances should not be high. Moreover, he was not sure what kind of treasures he could create either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the 1,000-year Gloomy Wood and could not help but wonder if it would flower and fruit. However, so far, there were no signs of it doing so. Moreover, what good would there be if it were to flower or fruit?</p>
 <p>The Nine-Petal Lotus in the pond seemed to have reached a limit, with very strong stems and had covered up the surface of the pond. The Nine-Petal Lotus had given the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal a celestial aura and its pure and divine aura let the surroundings have a comfortable feeling.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After exiting the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui didn't set up his tent. He had taken sufficient rest in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Now, it was still late in the night, with stars hanging up in the sky. The bright moon also hung up high in the sky and the things in the surroundings could be seen very clearly.</p>
 <p>In the village a distance away, there were still a few families with their lights lit up. Seemed like they had not turned in yet.</p>
 <p>He suddenly thought of his Pure Gold Fishing Rod. Since he had nothing to do now, he might as well try to fish with it and see how his luck was. Each time the Pure Gold Fishing Rod was used, it would bring about tremendous benefits to Qing Shui. Therefore, when he thought of it now, he felt agitated.</p>
 <p>It was not that the Pure Gold Fishing Rod could fish out good stuff regardless of the place. The prerequisite was that there must be good stuff in the area. The Pure Gold Fishing Rod would just greatly increase the chances that something good would be fished up.</p>
 <p>If the place he fished at had no good items, then there was no way that he would be able to get any. This was the Southern Sea and even though it was not at the deepest spot, it was decent. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to give it a try.</p>
 <p>If it was too deep, Qing Shui wouldn't dare to try it. The dangers in the water were greater than that on land and the demonic beasts were stronger too. Although the world of the nine continents had a great stretch of land, it was still far for a match compared to the vast Southern Sea or Eastern Sea.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked for a spot and took out his Pure Gold Fishing Rod. Here, Qing Shui wouldn't be afraid that he would fish out demonic beasts which were stronger than him. After all, at this distance, demonic beasts that were that powerful would not appear. Another reason was that the people living on this island had been able to live safely.</p>
 <p>Fishing tested a person's patience. Most people in his previous life who enjoyed fishing were the elderly who had done so mainly for entertainment purposes. Not many yougsters would be able to sit there the whole day even though there might be no catch at all. However, the elderly could sit there, enjoying themselves even if they didn't catch anything.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his patience level was acceptable. Moreover, with the Pure Gold Fishing Rod, it was impossible for him to not be able to catch anything. There was only one thing. It seemed that the Pure Gold Fishing Rod had not fished out any rubbish before. Even the fish it caught would be the most expensive kinds in the market. It was a pity that Qing Shui was not short of money and had no plans to sell fish. He just chucked them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Time passed by slowly and the time it took for an incense to burn passed by. Qing Shui's fishing rod didn't move in the least. However, this was normal. It was also because the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan had been wiped out that Qing Shui was in a very good mood, thus he was enjoying this peace which didn't come by often.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, the fishing rod moved."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly pulled up the Pure Gold Fishing Rod in surprise.</p>
 <p>Crimson Carp!</p>
 <p>He was neither disappointed nor happy, or rather, just a little happy since not everyone could catch something like this. The Crimson Carp was a type of carp and was extremely delicious. Moreover, it had another use, which was to invigorate the male's sexual abilities.</p>
 <p>Not every cultivator could excel in sex but they would generally be slightly stronger than ordinary people, especially people who tempered their bodies. When they strengthened their bodies, their kidneys and other internal organs would also be strengthened and thus their sexual abilities would be stronger as well.</p>
 <p>However, there were also people who overly indulged in sex and used strong medicinal herbs. As time passed, even powerful cultivators would eventually lose their sexual abilities. Therefore, even though this Crimson Carp was only about one foot long, it could fetch a hundred taels of gold outside. There might even be people who would pay a thousand gold taels for it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and tossed it into the pond in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The pond was now filled with a great variety of rare fish.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then continued to fish, taking it as a form of relaxation. When the day comes, it would be another tiring day. He had gotten used to a life like this. Everyday felt very fulfilling.</p>
 <p>The martial arts path was not just tough but also lonely. It required a strong heart and determination. Otherwise, even a genius would only go to waste.</p>
 <p>Another 15 minutes passed and the fishing rod moved again. Qing Shui grabbed it tightly and flung it up. He was stunned. Although he had not seen it before, he could call out its name in just one look.</p>
 <p>Nine-Headed Lion Grass!</p>
 <p>The item was only one foot long, and was a crimson red all over. At one look, it was just like a flaming lion but with nine small heads. This was a plant with dense roots and branches. It looked very real and was much better than other stuff people called art.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was exceptionally happy as this was one of the medicinal herbs required for the "Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet". He had not expected to get it here since he would never have thought that this crimson red Nine-Headed Lion Grass actually grew in the water.</p>
 <p>He was now only short of a couple of items. However, Qing Shui felt that he would probably still need a little more time to find them all. Qing Shui was also full of anticipation for the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to upgrade. There might be some powerful treasures appearing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to fish as the sky started to light up. He caught another two Crimson Carp and two crabs. Qing Shui planned to eat one of the fish today since it tasted good.</p>
 <p>With that Nine-Headed Lion Grass, Qing Shui was satisfied. He decided to spend some time fishing here everyday from now on. It would be good if he could find some treasures but the time spent would also have been worth it even if there were no more.</p>
 <p>Launching his fists!</p>
 <p>Standing on this slanted and smooth rock surface, he faced the east and waved his arms about. He didn't practice at a fast speed but was extremely serious.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui practiced his Taichi now, he no longer asked for anything but just let it flow naturally with his heart.</p>
 <p>This was also something which Qing Shui had comprehended recently. Dao comes naturally from the heart.</p>
 <p>Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p>A new day began and Qing Shui continued to be thrust backward by the many huge waves. The tremendous force came in many consecutive waves ceaselessly. After Qing Shui fended off the first wave, there would still be a second, a third... until Qing Shui ran out of strength and was slapped against the rock cliffs.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui was very happy. He knew that he found the right method. Although he appeared to be in a pathetic state, he had gained a lot more insight to the Wave Essence and had grasped new things he had not known about before.</p>
 <p>Experience was something that must be accumulated gradually. Qing Shui understood this theory and thus was in no rush. He calmly cultivated here, not asking for a breakthrough but only hoping to learn some things he had not known before. This would be his takeaway.</p>
 <p>Waving out his sword!</p>
 <p>Boom boom...</p>
 <p>Another series of clashing sounds rang out and Qing Shui was then pushed back to the cliff walls again.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, my prowess is now much stronger."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was elated to discover that the prowess of his Sword of Fifth Wave had increased by quite a lot. Or rather, it had become more concise. It was just like how pressure works. In the past, he might have needed to step down with his entire foot but now, he was stepping with the tip of his toes. Although the strength and pressure were not as before, it was now a lot more effective.</p>
 <p>Focus!</p>
 <p>Focus on the strength!</p>
 <p>Focus on the concentration!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He grasped new things once again. The martial arts path was never ending. This was another Truth Realm. Seemed like his sword skill and prowess of his other attacking skills could be raised by quite a lot.</p>
 <p>Under the state of focusing his attention, the prowess of his attack could be raised by about 20%. The same goes for his body's defence abilities as well.</p>
