Therefore, they didn't continue any further. Right now, Muyun Qingge was already very powerful and at the very least, she was much stronger compared to the few demonic beasts that Qing Shui had left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was close to noon and Qing Shui decided to make a move right after lunch. Seeing that Qing Shui was in such a hurry, Luo Qingcheng felt a little touched, but she didn't try to say anything to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since even Luo Qingcheng didn't say anything, the others didn't either. Everyone felt very anxious and even if Qing Shui didn't say anything, Muyun Qingge would probably urge him to head off earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They prepared a sumptuous meal, and although everyone tried to chat happily, there was still some melancholy. Therefore, the meal was over quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After lunch, Qing Shui did a check on the formations here and left the Dark Phoenix, the Dragon Elephant, and Long Zhu`er behind. These demonic beasts were very powerful now and what's more important, they had powerful resistance to attacks. Two of them were control-typed demonic beasts while the Dark Phoenix could kill an existence that was on the same level as him as easy as cutting the grass. Even existences that were much stronger than they, wouldn't be able to hurt them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, to a certain degree, the reason Qing Shui had kept them here was so that they could act as control-typed shields. Control type demonic beasts tend to be able to turn the tables around in an instant in many situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge bade the few ladies goodbye and went on their way. Their destination was the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sacred Ocean Sound Cave was a dangerous area deep in the North Ocean. Qing Shui already had the map to the destination, but they must first pass through the deep sea domain. Therefore, the journey was very dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them traveled rapidly toward the deeper region of the North Ocean. Although Qing Shui had the Paragon Water Shield, he still decided to use the Nine Continents Steps. The Nine Continents Steps could now be used in the ocean domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea if there was any link to the Paragon Water Shield, but it was something to be happy about. After all, in the vast ocean domain, it'd be too disappointing if the Nine Continents Steps couldn't be used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, it didn't disappoint Qing Shui and he could now use the Nine Continents Steps. This truly made Qing Shui like a fish in the water when he was in the ocean domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A glow that only Qing Shui could see appear below Qing Shui's and Muyun Qingge's feet. Then, it encompassed the two of them, making them disappear like a flash from where they were, then teleporting them from time to time again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's Nine Continents Boots had now surpassed its former-self by a lot. During such a long period of time, the Nine Continents Boots had leveled up by two levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Continents Boots!</span></p>

Even an Early Divinity could find it hard to destroy in the least. It also had the additional battle technique--the Nine Continents Steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Continent Steps: Use the Nine Continent Boots to activate the Nine Continents Steps. The user will immediately reach over 10 million li away in a straight line. In the present realm, level 8, the Heart's Territory, it could be used 100 times daily.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, it only revealed to be at the seventh realm of the Divine Artifact level and nothing was shown before that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Nine Continents Boots' Nine Continents Steps, Qing Shui wouldn't have that much pressure in his journey to the deep regions of the North Ocean. Otherwise, for him that needed to go and return within ten months, and still needed to find the Sacred Mudra Flower, the time wasn't enough at all. Right now, he could only depend on luck. With his current speed, he would probably take half a month to arrive at the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After about 90 Nine Continents Steps, Qing Shui came to a stop. They had traveled a far distance from the Sunset Sea King Palace's domain. He was also left with only a few uses of the Nine Continents Steps and planned to leave them in case he needed to flee. After all, this place wasn't the same as the borders of the North Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This area was an endless stretch of ocean domain. Qing Shui took a look at the surroundings and didn't see life forms that were significantly powerful. There were some mountains, large-scaled sea beasts, fishes, and others. However, they were all scared off by Qing Shui's aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge called out the White Jade Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Jade Dragon was now considered a true member of the dragon tribe now. Back then, it had been too weak and had ended up being suppressed by Qing Shui and tamed by Muyun Qingge. However, under Qing Shui's help and after consumed medicinal pills, Ancient Demonic Fruits, the Fortune Golden Pellet and others, its bloodline had improved by many folds and its abilities were also very terrifying now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge White Jade Dragon moved rapidly in the water and Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge stood on its back, looking at the surroundings as they rapidly passed by fishes and water plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, when will we reach the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave?" Muyun Qingge had no idea how far Qing Shui's Nine Continents Steps could travel each time, but she felt that it should be far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"At most half a month. We might even be able to arrive in about ten days. That is if there aren't any accidents in between." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was stunned. From the Sunset Sea King Palace to the deep regions of the North Sea... It should be the deep regions... The Sacred Ocean Sound Cave's location should be considered to be in the deep regions... Based on Muyun Qingge's anticipations, they would need to take more than two months at the very least before they could arrive at the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave. Luo Qingcheng could only wait for ten months. If they needed half a year to travel back and forth, they would only be left with less than four months to locate the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave. Therefore, she didn't wish to waste even a single day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, upon hearing that it would only take half a month or even about ten days, she was a little surprised. She was immediately filled with rejoice and looked at Qing Shui happily, "That's great! Our hopes will be a lot greater then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmmm!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm really very worried. Are the chances of us finding the Sacred Mudra Flower high?" Right now, there was only Qing Shui and her, so she knew that Qing Shui would tell her the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Even if there isn't the Sacred Mudra Flower, I'll still think of a way to treat Qingcheng." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge knew the meaning behind Qing Shui's words. The chances of them finding the Sacred Mudra Flower was very low, very very low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry. I have the confidence." Qing Shui saw Muyun Qingge's dejected expression and consoled her.</span></p>
