 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given her current injuries, she couldn’t even stand by herself. Qing Shui naturally wouldn’t place her down. He just carried her without regard to her protests. “Listen to me. Nothing will happen to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could see that their opponents basically had no more chance of claiming victory. But now, because of the Sunset Palace Mistress’s injuries, Qing Shui directly used Emperor’s Qi.This could increase the chance of their side obtaining a victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s rough voice caused the heart of the Palace Mistress to be filled with a current of warmth. Right now, she was injured, but she felt that this was her most blessed moment. In fact, she even wanted this moment to continue forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew that she was at the point of no return, falling in love with a man that was not in love with her. She didn’t complain. She was very strong and had already stated her feelings. However, she was an extremely proud woman with dignity. She wouldn’t cling on to someone simply because there was no meaning to doing that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she had always been filled with bitterness, an indescribable bitterness in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, when she heard Qing Shui’s coaxing words, her heart felt extremely warm as Qing Shui was the man she loved. She gently lied in his embrace with no rebuttal as her heart grew more firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui didn’t have any other thoughts in his mind. He was embracing a jade-like beauty, but it was too difficult to achieve the state where there were no distractions in his heart. It wasn’t that Qing Shui didn’t like her. Who wouldn’t like a beautiful woman? It was just that Qing Shui had other reasons of his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle continued. Qing Shui carried her and walked away. Right now, he didn’t use his hands. He only needed to use the Emperor’s Qi, Art of Pursuing, Nine Palace Laws and spirit energy to control the battlefield easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden huge change caused the battle to be swiftly concluded. Actually, it was usually impossible for powerful experts to fight for a full day. When experts fought against each other, victory and defeat could be determined in the span of a single breath. This was why the battlefield was subjected to instantaneous changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, there were also exceptions. When two evenly-matched opponents were fighting and all other factors remained neutral, the battle might take a very long time. But everyone would surely have different ultimate arts and sure-kill techniques, so there would always be changes to the battlefield depending on the decisions of the ones fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge wasn’t injured and neither was Old Mo nor Old Jin. Qing Shui discovered that although his injuries now couldn’t heal instantaneously, he only needed a single night of rest, as his body had automatically activated its recovery mode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Violet Jade Immortal Realm had already reached the ninth level, and the time dilation effect was more than twice that of the previous level. The fact that he could only enter there for six hours per day still hadn’t changed, but the amount of time he could spend within had increased tremendously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under such conditions, in addition to Qing Shui’s powerful recovery rate, he would naturally be able to heal from most injuries in the span of a single night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Yiye Jiange stood by his side, staring concernedly at the Palace Mistress as she spoke, “Qing Shui, will elder sister Qingcheng be okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen.” Qing Shui was very confident of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the Palace Mistress was already in a half-dazed state. Nobody would imagine that Qing Shui was currently hugging a beauty. After all, the face of this woman was pale white, and her entire body was covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, can you take elder sister Qingcheng back to treat her injuries first? Leave the things here to us.” Muyun Qingge returned and urged Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle here could already be considered concluded. There was basically no more danger. Qing Shui thought for a while as he nodded. Right now, he could only do what he could to help the Sunset Palace Mistress’s injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, Qing Shui, Yiye Jiange and the Palace Mistress departed first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The injury the Palace Mistress sustained was on her stomach. It was an extremely serious wound. If Qing Shui wasn’t present, the Palace Mistress would definitely have become a cripple today. To a martial cultivator, this was simply too cruel, especially for people at the divine level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s state of heart was a little out of sorts. He knew that this woman was in love with him and if he had feelings for her, she most probably wouldn’t reject them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the initial operation was done, Qing Shui entered into his Violet Jade Immortal Realm and took out some herbs, preparing to concoct medicine as he walked out of the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the Palace Mistress had fallen asleep. Before this, she had been in a half-sleeping, half-awake state, knowing Qing Shui was tending to her injuries. The shadow of this man grew clearer and clearer in her heart. This was already the second time. His image seemed to have been branded into her mind. She eventually lost consciousness and fell asleep despite so many thoughts, with a trace of complexity in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui walked out, Yiye Jiange was waiting outside for him. She asked in concern when she saw him, “How is sister Qingcheng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No problem. She only needs some time to recover. She’s currently asleep.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that the Sunset Palace Mistress was already asleep, Yiye Jiange also abolished her thought of going to see her. Sighing in a light voice, “This time, although we are victorious, this is merely the beginning. I’m really worried given my current state.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Yiye Jiange was referring to the matter of her being pregnant. Right now, it was only around a month plus a bit more of time. Although it wouldn’t affect anything even if she fought, Qing Shui would never let her participate in the battle. He could sense the precious life within Yiye Jiange’s womb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui’s heart was a little heavy. But luckily, he felt that he would be able to handle the things to come. The strength of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace was truly not bad. This also made Qing Shui more and more curious about the other oceanic areas, the depths of the Haohan Continent, and the Nine Continent Star Ocean Domains. It seemed like this world was truly very dangerous. Once he entered, he wouldn’t have the freedom to act independently anymore and could only grit his teeth as he continued down the path. He wouldn’t be able to retreat, and in any case, even if he wanted to retreat, there wouldn’t be a path for him to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to worry with me here. Even if this Third Palace master cannot be considered among the peak strength of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace, he should be among the upper ranks. They wouldn’t want an all-out annihilation battle with us either. At the very least, they wouldn’t ignite such a battle within the short term.” Qing Shui held her hand tightly and spoke in a light-sounding tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Third Palace master might be very strong, but he is only ranked within the top five in the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. At the very most, he can only be considered #5. The Great Palace master is the strongest, and she is a woman that has cultivated the Nine Yin Sacred Hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Yin Sacred Hands?” Qing Shui stated in bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s said that she has a Supreme Yin Physique and an extremely powerful cultivation. The main thing is that no matter male or female, nobody would be able to withstand that powerful Yin energy. She can use the energy to launch formless attacks.” Yiye Jiange spoke in a tone of worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he heard this, Qing Shui felt even less worried. A Supreme Yin Physique was of no threat to him, as he had a Supreme Yang Physique. On a certain level, the two of them should be equal. As for who would be the stronger one, that would have to depend on individual cultivation level. If the other party was proficient in spirit-energy type attacks, Qing Shui felt that he would definitely be able to defend against that. After all, he had roughly 70% immunity when it came to spirit energy attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even his fleshy body was capable of enduring great damage. This was Qing Shui’s greatest source of confidence!</span></p>
