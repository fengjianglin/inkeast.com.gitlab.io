 <p>AST 1225 - The Missed Out Miraculous Nine Heavens Golden Pellet, Great Perfection Stage for the Nine Yang Golden Body, Unlocking the 8th Heavenly Layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange didn't stand on ceremony. He took a look at Qing Shui, then opened up the porcelain bottle and swallowed the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl. This action showed how he trusted Qing Shui. Although doing this wasn't considered much, it let both parties feel the sincerity they had for each other.</p>
 <p>"Circulate your power and refine it!" Qing Shui urged him on.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange didn't dare to show any delays and quickly circulated his powers to refine it. He now knew what it was and was naturally very agitated. In this world, there were too few people who had unique bloodlines and those people had great achievements. However, even if there were only too few people who were born with unique bloodlines, treasures that could allow one to change their bloodline still exist. The Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl was one of them.</p>
 <p>Under normal circumstances, digesting this Nine Heavens Golden Pellet would still take some time. However, the domineering Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl not only planted a drop of Violet Golden Blood in his body, it also transformed the medicinal effects of the Nine Heavens Golden Pellet.</p>
 <p>Within a short amount of time, Tian Jiange went through a life-changing transformation. He opened his eyes and saw that Qing Shui was smiling and nodding at him. Right now, saying thanks between them would only make it feel as if they were very distant.</p>
 <p>"Brother, I'll head out to be promoted as a core disciple in this two days. After becoming a core disciple, I'll gain some status in the Lord Sect. At the very least, I'll be able to take part in some of the matters concerning the Lord Sect." Tian Jiange clenched his teeth slightly and said.</p>
 <p>"There's no hurry. Don't worry, I'll be fine. What I need to focus on right now is to work on getting stronger. Brother, the same goes for you. Rather than relying on others, it's better to rely on yourself."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Tian Jiange must had been living under the protection of his elder brother. If he couldn't get rid of this shackles, his achievements would be restricted. It's a good thing to have a powerful elder brother but it was also because of this that his elder brother become an unsurpassable shadow in his heart. It was as if he had been caged up. Even though the cage was very big, there were still restrictions applied to him.</p>
 <p>When Tian Jiange heard Qing Shui's words, he fell into a short daze before his countenance changed. It took a long time before he let out a long exhale and looked at Qing Shui with a gleam in his eyes. He smiled and said, "I won't stand on ceremony with you. You'll always be my brother, for eternity."</p>
 <p>"It's easy to get money but hard to find a soulmate. I hope that we'll always remain soulmates, remain brothers." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>"We will. Let's work hard together. A good future will come to us."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui said that, he still harbored some slight selfishness. Humans are selfish creatures, who would tend to help someone they were close with rather than to side with reason. Therefore, he wanted to create a bond. Of course, whether or not it could be sustained in the future was another thing altogether.</p>
 <p>No one knows what would happen in the future. Moreover, a large part of the reason for Qing Shui was still to make a friend. It was also considered setting up a base. Everyone hoped to have people who supported them. When facing enemies, a person would hope that there were others that stood together with him.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui could only hope that the Saint Child wouldn't hold it against him. Or rather, hoping that his current level wouldn't be taken seriously by the Saint Child. This would allow Qing Shui some time to develop himself. Moreover, he hoped that what the Eldest Princess said would have some use and Tian Jiange would also be able to help him a little.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would be able to deal with most people. He had the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring, Nine Continents Steps and Nine Palace Steps. Together with the current level of his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, not many people would be able to stop him if he wish to escape.</p>
 <p>However, no one liked escaping, to be seen running away with his tail between his legs like a lost cause.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened the box in his hands. It was the Nine Heavens Golden Pellet which Tian Jiange gave him before he left.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange had two of these. He took one for himself and left the other for Qing Shui. Tian Jiange told Qing Shui that this was given to him by his elder brother and was an extremely rare medicinal pill. Each person would only be able to take one pill once. However, the effects might be tremendous to some people, while it was almost insignificant for others. Of course, this was all relative, since everyone would feel that the Nine Heavens Golden Pellet was very powerful after they took it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the jade bottle in the box. Just seeing the flashing luminous light that the bottle exuded, he knew that it was something very precious. He opened it up and saw that there was a medicinal pill that was thin and long like a silk cocoon. It was the size of a thumb and had a golden color which exude a powerful spiritual Qi.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>Nine Heavens Golden Bone Pellet!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. This wasn't a Nine Heavens Golden Pellet. He seemed to have noticed something and quickly read on.</p>
 <p>It was a mysterious medicinal pill that could increase the user's aptitude and talent. It could stimulate one's potential, allowing the user's rate of growing stronger to be raised tremendously within a short period of time. It had an excellent effect on people with strong bones.</p>
 <p>If used with the Requiem Grass, there would be an unexpected surprise!</p>
 <p>He had picked up someone else's missed item and found himself a treasure! This was what Qing Shui felt at the moment. After he called out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal directly. He wanted to give it a try. This Nine Heavens Golden Bone Pellet could be something which could change his destiny.</p>
 <p>He had a very strong feeling about it. This time around, it was unusually strong.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Requiem Grass, which was something that he just left in there after he purchased it from the Central Continent very long ago. He didn’t expect that it would be useful to him now.</p>
 <p>After he adjusted his body to its optimal condition, Qing Shui took the Nine Heavens Golden Bone Pellet, which was followed by a Requiem Grass' essence.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Nine Yang Golden Body was at the large success stage and his bones were already golden in color. This medicinal pill had a greater effect on people with powerful bones. He felt that his bones could definitely be considered as powerful.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, he could sense the changes in his body. His bones seemed to be stretching and were becoming more golden in color. A feeling that wasn't uncomfortable but felt strange spread out in his body.</p>
 <p>His bones had turned more golden than before. They seemed to be slightly thicker and stronger, which appeared more powerful. The energy in his bones were still gradually increasing. Slowly, the golden bones presented a translucent feeling.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>As if something was smashed, an existence that was like a small- pure golden seemed to surge up through his skeleton, which soon entered his consciousness.</p>
 <p>Its target was the golden star in his consciousness!</p>
 <p>Nine Yang Golden Body reached the great perfection stage!</p>
 <p>A hint of will flashed in Qing Shui's consciousness and he felt that the light sound from earlier was akin to him breaking through a restriction. It must have been the Nine Yang Golden Body's restriction and thus, it was now at the great perfection stage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only felt that he was pumped up with tremendous power. He didn’t had the chance to feel surprised when his consciousness also went through an overwhelming change due to the collision of that small golden dragon. Both his cultivation level and spirit energy had improved to a large extent.</p>
 <p>The changes to his consciousness made Qing Shui suddenly felt a very strong and familiar fluctuation. It was after the small golden dragon had entered the golden star. The golden star was currently located to where the Niwan Palace was at previously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly opened his eyes and looked toward the surroundings of his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Elation flashed in his eyes as he found himself in an even wider world that was over ten times bigger than it was before.</p>
 <p>It had leveled up! The 8th Heavenly Layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't expected that it would level up now. One Nine Heavens Golden Pellet, or rather, a Nine Heavens Golden Bone Pellet, had not only allowed his Nine Yang Golden Body to reach great perfection, it even leveled up his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Due to the small golden dragon clashing into the golden star in his consciousness, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal leveled up. For the previous few times, he could only attain a breakthrough thanks to the ladies. This was why Qing Shui had always thought that upgrading the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would always be related to women.</p>
 <p>Even till now, he still wasn't sure. It was because this time around, the level up was still related to his spirit energy. Duo Cultivation could also increase one's spirit energy, so it was hard to say. However, this upgrade showed that leveling up of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal wasn't just possible through women.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was in no hurry to check out the inscription steele. The pond in the past could now be called a lake.</p>
 <p>It was too big. The black fishes, the Golden Medicinal Turtle, the Old Clam, the Rainbow Trout Fish and others were now all dispersed out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had initially thought that the pond was getting overpopulated. However, it now had suddenly become big as a lake and was very deep.</p>
 <p>It was several hundreds of meters deep but the water was so clear that he could see the bottom of the lake. It was a very beautiful scene.</p>
 <p>As he stood next to the huge lake, Qing Shui calmed down and then looked around. He realized that the land area had increased and there seemed to be new additions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked towards the inscription steele to see what the 8th level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was like and what new things were there.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went straight to the bottom where the description for the 8th level was written.</p>
 <p>Level 8 Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, unlocked!</p>
 <p>Looking at this, Qing Shui heaved a huge sigh of relief. The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had leveled up. Seeing these few words made a huge surge of happiness grew in him. He then lifted his head to looked for the rewards for the level 8 Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Rewarded with a Spring of Life!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the few words in a daze. After he stared at it for a very long time, he was sure that he hadn't made a mistake. Although he knew that the reward for the level 8 Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was definitely not ordinary, he was still taken aback by the Spring of Life.</p>
 <p>Just from its name, he could tell that it was a powerful existence. It should be spring water that could recover life, heal various illness and purge toxins. One that could increase one's lifespan and could bring the body great benefits.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui hadn't taken a look at the Spring of Life, his senses told him that the effects it would bring were definitely tremendous.</p>
 <p>Reward one Ancient Demonic Fruit Tree. It takes 1,000 years to bloom, 1,000 years to fruit, and 1,000 years to mature. Each time around, ten Demonic Fruits would be produced and it can only be taken by demonic beasts. Each demonic beast could only take one every 100 years and it could increase the demonic beast's abilities by a lot.</p>
 <p>Reward 10,000 Years medicinal herbs: redbud flower, tianlan herb, emotion voiding grass, heartbroken grass....</p>
 <p>There were several tens of varieties, all of them were 10,000 Years. Qing Shui even saw a few medicinal herbs required for the Golden Fragrance Jade. As expected, the reward for the level 8 Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was extraordinary, all of the medicinal herbs were 10,000 Years and were still in the midst of growing. It could be said that other than certain unique places, they were hard to come by.</p>
 <p>Reward ten Immortal Fishes. They have special uses.</p>
 <p>Reward four loaches. They have special uses.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very happy. Even if he might not know how to use some of them and their names were weird, it didn't hinder his happy mood. Looking at the various rewards, each of them could make one go crazy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui read on till the end but there was no change to the time ratio in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal with the outside world. He didn't know if he should be happy or upset. Each time he come, it would be 100 days. If one didn't have determination, it would be hard to hang on. If he didn't use up all 100 days, it would feel like a waste. However, Qing Shui's disappointment in this area was still stronger. If the time were to increase, he could choose to spend less time cultivating and have more time to manage and control.</p>
 <p>The time he could spend in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was still 6 hours!</p>
