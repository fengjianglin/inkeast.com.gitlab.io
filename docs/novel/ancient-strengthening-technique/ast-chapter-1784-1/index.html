These people also stayed behind. Qing Shui, Puyang Qing, and Soulsearch chatted as they sipped on the tea in the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, I heard the news that the Heavenly Saber Manor's head seems to have already surpassed the existence of a False God cultivator" Puyang Qing looked at Qing Shui and said slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now understood why Puyang Qing had been frowning all this time. From the beginning, Qing Shui knew that he had something bothering him. However, Qing Shui had confidence in himself and thus did not ask anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyang Qing was still very worried about Qing Shui. After giving it a lot of thought, he still decided to talk to Qing Shui about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That means that he's likely to be a Divinity." Qing Shui's expression remained calm. He had encountered quite a number of Divinities in the North Sea. In the depths of the Haohan Continent and in the ocean domain, one would be able to come into contact with Early Divine Grade cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was still the same principle. If one wasn't strong enough, they wouldn't come into contact with these group of people. The other party wouldn't care to have any interactions as they would be on a different level. Just like how an adult wouldn't fight or quarrel with a kindergarten child. The things which they fought for, were different and there were no clashes of interest. The other party wouldn't have the spare time for this either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't surprised. He hadn't encountered any Divinities in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. There were very few False God cultivators as well and they were all Early False God cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite cultivated for so many years. Puyang Qing had only reached Grade Two False God. After experiencing one False God Tribulation, he felt that it would be very hard for him to have any more breakthroughs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Him being a Divinity is only a possibility. He's probably a High-Grade False God or Peak-Grade False God. The chances of him being a Divinity is far too low." Puyang Qing said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyang Qing's abilities had cast a restriction over his views. To him, Divinities were existences which he could not come into contact with. Therefore, after so much guesswork, he still felt that the opponent would be a Peak False God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, even Qing Shui felt that the possibility of a Divinity appearing here was very, very low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui returned to the room, Qing Xiu had already fallen asleep and Yiye Jiange was drawing something. She didn't even lift her head when Qing Shui came in and only said softly, "You're back!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave an answer and looked at Yiye Jiange, who was bending over slightly and drawing at the long table. That untainted aura she radiated and her focused expression was far too mesmerizing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw that Yiye Jiange was drawing him and already in the final phase of her work. Many of his women were proficient in music, chess, literature, and painting. Of course, in terms of drawing, they were still no match for Qing Shui. He already surpassed normal levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange's drawing ability was definitely top notch. It made Qing Shui feel that she should have reached the level of drawing bones, bringing out the charm right down from the bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a level wasn't achieved through drawing out the bone structures. The drawn character gave the feeling that they didn't exist on paper and was very lifelike. To the extent that they had bone structures supporting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ordinary drawings were just drawings and no matter how realistic they were drawn, they still gave off the feeling that they existed only on the paper. Only drawings that gave off the feeling that the characters were alive, would be considered to surpass the ordinary level of proficiency in drawing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange was drawing while Qing Shui was admiring his woman, waiting until Yiye Jiange put down her brush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange lifted her head to see that Qing Shui has been looking at her all this time. Even though they were husband and wife and even have a child, she was still a little embarrassed and threw him an annoyed glance, "You've already been looking for so many years. Is it still not enough?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No matter how long I look at you, it'd never be enough." Qing Shui smiled and went over, wrapping his hands around her slender waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"By the time I've become an old and white-haired granny, I wonder if you'll still look at me." Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No matter how much you change, you'll still be the image I have of you in my heart. It'd never change. The passing time will only make me even more infatuated with you." Qing Shui smiled and said calmly. It was nothing pretentious nor did he show any attitude. It was very normal but gave off an indescribable feeling of reliability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange's smile was even wider and she pointed to the painting on the table. "Take a look at it. I've improved."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, "You're already at the level of drawing bones."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a sense of achievement just from looking at this drawing. He was the one being drawn and it had been drawn personally by Yiye Jiange. Even if a person had a high-level mastery of drawing, to draw someone to this degree, they would still need to put in a lot of thought to this person. It must be from the heart, or else it would be impossible to draw something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His achievement wasn't that Yiye Jiange could draw this well, but that a lady who was like a Goddess liked him. She was his woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, Qing Shui woke up very early as well. He faced the morning sun and practiced an hour of fist techniques, he was feeling refreshed after training. After living in the ocean for several years, Qing Shui still felt that it was better on land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had the Paragon Water Shield and could move like a fish in the water, but it was just the feeling, the slightest feeling. He still enjoyed the land and that was a feeling that burned deep into his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After breakfast, it was already late in the morning. Qing Shui hoped that the other party would come earlier. He was still in a hurry to head home. Having been away for so long made Qing Shui couldn't wait to go home immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kinship held the greatest spot in Qing Shui's heart. It was the harbor to his heart and soul. It was only with family would one have a home, allowing him to feel that he wasn't a floating plank, but that he was rooted and had a goal. There would be people with whom he could share his emotions. Happiness needed to be shared. Otherwise, no matter how great one's achievements were, no matter how great a life they led, they wouldn't feel happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ning~~</span></p>

It was a series of black dots, accompanied by crisp cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt very happy. He wasn't afraid that they would come, but rather afraid that they wouldn't. He hoped that there would be people who could carry some weight amongst these people. Right now, he didn't have the time to waste with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than Yiye Jiange, the others didn't feel relaxed at all. The Heavenly Saber Manor kept a very high profile and their reputation in Yehuang Country was also very high. Moreover, the Heavenly Saber Manor showed signs of becoming even more powerful.</span></p>
