 <p><strong>AST 1516 - The Hua Clan that doesn’t know when to give up</strong></p>
 <p>During this period of time, nothing major happened in the Linhai City. The Imperial Cuisine Hall had the protection of the Lan Clan and Ziche Clan and there are also several clans who own a favor to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. So even if Qing Shui isn’t here, there would still be people willing to step up to help the hall settle its problems.</p>
 <p>Because Yu Niang had to take care of the little lass, she returned to her room soon after. After Yu Niang left, Qin Qing and Xue Nuo also departed, leaving behind Qing Shui, Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng.</p>
 <p>Although Tianyi had a pretty good relation with Qing Shui and the others, he knew it was impossible for him to stand on the same stage with them. Maybe they might still travel together, or maybe they would split up after a while. It might even be a problem if they wished to meet again in the future.</p>
 <p>“Where is this elder miss of Qin Clan from? I can’t even sense her strength. Is she stronger than you?” Lan Lingfeng asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The three of them are people who inherited the inheritances of battle gods. When together, they had nothing they couldn’t discuss. And in the future, it can be said that they would stick together in hard times.</p>
 <p>“She’s much stronger than me, at least two times or more.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>However Qing Shui was very happy. He also wished for Qin Qing to be very powerful. No matter what, Qin Qing was their ally and now, she can also be considered their friend.</p>
 <p>“Then, you and this elder miss of the Qin Clan…” Lan Linfeng mumbled. His meaning was clear to all.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I say Sir Lan. How’s your situation now?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>Lan Lingfeng instantly was like a withered tomato. He spoke powerlessly, “Now we are ordinary friends or maybe just slightly better than that. It’s so difficult to woo her but if I can’t succeed, I would feel that there’s no meaning in my life.”</p>
 <p>“Sometimes its good to put in effort, and at other times, it would be better just to let nature takes its course. If you love someone, don’t pressure them. If you continue in your manner, she might even try to avoid you. For example, if there’s a woman deep in love with you yet she misunderstood your feelings for her. She would say yes to marrying you instantly because she loved you too much. However, she would chose to suicide if you do not want to be with her. What would you do?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“I will choose to make things clear and leave her.” Lan Lingfeng spoke resolutely after contemplating for awhile.</p>
 <p>“That means that you, the number one young man in the Linhai City is willing to wait decades for the woman you truly love and reject others. Your answer is great, I’m sure many women would be touched by you. But sometimes, things are better left unspoken as actions speaks louder than words. If you put words to emphasize your actions, it would instead become a burden.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also knew that his words might not be fully right. But he felt that Ziche Sha wasn't an ordinary woman. One would definitely need a long time to slowly enter inch by inch into her heart.</p>
 <p>“Mhm, I understand. Luckily you appeared and pointed me in the right direction. Oh ya, you still didn’t say if there’s anything going on with you and the eldest miss of the Qin Clan?” Lan Lingfeng seemed to be very interested in this topic.</p>
 <p>“I have no feelings towards her.” Qing Shui calmly replied.</p>
 <p>“Expert. You are truly an expert, my idol. You have to help me then. Why don’t we compete and see if you can pursue the elder miss of Qin Clan first or if I can pursue the elder miss of the Ziche Clan first?”</p>
 <p>“Lan Lingfeng are you courting death?” At this moment, Ziche Sha, Qin Qing and Ling Fei walked over.</p>
 <p>Lan Lingfeng had a bitter smile on his face as he glanced at Qing Shui. But Qing Shui acted as though he saw nothing at all.</p>
 <p>“It’s just a joke. Sha`er, don’t you know what sort of person I am?” Lan Lingfeng smiled mischievously.</p>
 <p>Ziche Sha glared at Lan Lingfeng, but Qing Shui was very surprised because he discovered that it wasn’t Lan Lingfeng didn’t have any chance but rather, he stood quite a high chance. Some things cannot be determined so fast, this is especially true for matters of the heart.</p>
 <p>Yin Tong and Ling Fei just came by and said hello before returning to their rooms. They were a couple, and their emotions for each other deepened daily. This made Qing Shui envy them, especially so for the fact that they held nothing back when loving each others, with only one person in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew this was impossible for him. It’s known that the stronger a man was, the stronger his desires would be. A strong expert naturally would have a high desire to possess the women he likes. Even if he tried his best not to think about such things, it would be useless.</p>
 <p>This, in another perspective, can be motivation. Motivation also came from one having a purpose, as well as one’s own strength.</p>
 <p>Qin Qing stared at Qing Shui and smiled at him, bidding him good night before leaving together with Ziche Sha. In this place, only Qing Shui and Lan Lingfeng remained.</p>
 <p>“Actually you have a pretty high chance of bagging her. But don’t be too hurried.” Qing Shui laughed as he spoke to Lan Lingfeng.</p>
 <p>Lan Lingfeng’s background, looks and characters were all excellent. He’s most definitely the prince charming in the hearts of 99.9% females around the world. Even Qing Shui had no choice but to admit that Lan Lingfeng had a dignified demeanor with all his excellent aspects.</p>
 <p>There’s no doubt, he’s truly a prince charming!</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“Your mind have gone muddled up. Think back to the past and now, has her attitude to you changed?” Although Qing Shui didn’t know Ziche Sha’s exact feelings for Lan Lingfeng, he could see that at the very least, they can be considered good friends. Lovers usually starts from being friends, and rather than love at first sight, it might be more of what each individual’s hormones are telling them.</p>
 <p>Lan Lingfeng thought about it. His eyes shone with a slightly dazed expression. After which, he could only shake his head helplessly as he returned to his room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>The earth divine stone has been placed by Qing Shui into the Violet Jade Immortal Realm. He could feel that the entire realm seemed to contain boundless vitality and life force that generates spiritual qi to the point where it was several times compared to the external world.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the earth divine stone could even upgrade the Violet Jade Immortal Realm. Right now, the realm was already at the eighth-level. He didn’t know when would it be upgraded to the ninth level. Qing Shui didn’t really think much about it but he could faintly sense that if it eventually upgraded to the ninth level, the divine earth stone must have something to do with it.</p>
 <p>Cultivation…</p>
 <p>His strength rose by alot. And now, he had to re-stabilize his foundation. Right now, his strength has already reached 300 millions worth of sun.</p>
 <p>300 million...Qing Shui was very satisfied and on the other hand, somewhat not that satisfied. After all, his demonic beasts like the hellfire phoenix and golden-scaled dragon elephant, have already reached 1.4 billion worth of suns in strength, far exceeding his.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t sure what was Qin Qing’s current strength. But no matter what, her strength wouldn’t be lower compared to his pets. Now that she has obtained the inheritance of the phoenix battle god, it was still unknown what battle techniques she had.</p>
 <p>He thought of his phoenix form, and his technique, the phoenix finger. He would find an opportunity to see if she’s interested in learning them. Only now did Qing Shui truly experienced the power of the phoenix finger.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui has already fused the phoenix finger together with his ancient divine battle technique. The tyrannical nine stances contained the power of the phoenix finger and even if his strength was very low compared to his opponent, he would still be able to fight. Combining that with his mysterious footwork, Qing Shui felt confident even if he had to face an opponent of Qin Qing’s level.</p>
 <p>The Imperial Cuisine Hall still continued about with business. During these days where Qing Shui was away, there were many people who gathered here waiting for Qing Shui to treat them. Almost all the sects sent people out to gather information regarding the whereabouts of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He was back yesterday but nobody sought him out. But early today morning, somebody appeared.</p>
 <p>The first person who came by was actually an old man from the Hua Clan. Qing Shui’s memory was good. When he beat up the youngster from the Hua Clan back then, this old man was present.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Doctor Qing, you finally returned.” The old man smiled warmly in a fake manner as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect the Hua Clan would still come and look for him.”</p>
 <p>“Mister Hua, why are you here?” Qing Shui smiled back, but he didn’t fake too much politeness. Stretching his hand out, he invited the old man to take a sit as he sat down as well.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Doctor Qing has finally return. What a blessing for our Linhai City!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled but he didn’t say anything as he continued to stare at the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man smiled awkwardly, knowing that he would be driven away soon if he didn’t head straight into the topic. After all, the Hua Clan had no intimate connection with Qing Shui and in fact, Qing Shui was rather unhappy with them too.</p>
 <p>“It’s about the child you beated up that time. His private parts are injured by your blow, and he’s the only male descendant of my clan. Mister Qing, can you take a look and see if you can cure it?” The old man spoke awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Back then, it was none other than the young man who wanted to target Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>After contemplating for a moment, Qing Shui remembered that incident. “I can’t. His private part is completely damaged, I’m unable to do anything as well. Even if I can cure him, I wouldn’t do so. Why would I want to cure someone like him? So he can continue to harass innocent females?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t polite at all in his words. He was already being very good by not killing trash like this. It’s impossible for a leopard to change its spots. Even if he cured that young man, it wouldn’t take him long to revert back to his true nature.</p>
 <p>“I can guarantee to Mister Qing that that would definitely not happen. If that happened, I don’t need you to act. I will act myself to kill him.” The old man hurriedly spoke.</p>
 <p>“If you came here just for this, you can leave now. I’m unable to cure him.” Qing Shui didn’t have any favorable opinion of the Hua Clan.</p>
 <p>“The old ancestor of my clan have a matter he wished to discuss with you. So I’m here to invite you over.” The old man sighed, knowing it was pointless to push the issue. This was the true reason why he was here today.</p>
 <p>“I’m not free. I will be there in the future if I have time.” Qing Shui calmly spoke. If it was in the past, Qing Shui would still be more cautious. But this time, the trip to the Kunpeng Mountains made it so that Qing Shui had enough ‘capital’. In the Ice Domain Dynasty, Qing Shui currently feared no powers.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui wasn’t those arrogant and despotic characters. Also, he also knew that the Haohan Continent had divinities here. Even if the Ice Domain Dynasty had no divine experts, their foundations were sure to be incomparably deep. So, it wouldn’t be a mistake for him to remain low profile.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui understood quite alot about the Hua Clan. A clan like theirs wouldn’t even be able to enter Qing Shui’s eyes now. The most important thing was that the Hua Clan’s reputation was truly nasty. This was the main point.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked upon the Hua Clan with disdain. This made the old man felt extremely unhappy as sinister looks gleamed in his eyes. Qing Shui naturally saw it, but he acted like he didn’t see anything. It was for the best if the Hua Clan didn’t try anything. If they did, he didn’t mind annihilating them completely.</p>
