 <p><strong>Chapter 478 The Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow. The uses of Minute Subtlety. A narrow escape! .</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 478 - The Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow. The uses of Minute Subtlety. A narrow escape!</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">His entire hand rapidly turned a bloody red. It looked incomparably weird.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Feng Clan’s Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He has gone nuts!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This time, Qing Shui is done for!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Everything is going to be over!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, what shall we do? What can we do?” Huoyun Liu-Li anxiously looked at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue has always been Huoyun Liu-Li’s support. Back in Canglang Country, as long as Canghai Mingyue was there, who would have dared to pick on her? She subconsciously asked Canghai Mingyue who was next to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue bit her lips. Both of her hands were grasped together tightly, so tight that she didn’t even know that the skin of her palms got peeled off. The only thing she did was looking back at Chang Wuya and the others who were not so far away from her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuyan smiled bitterly as he shook his head at them:” it's too late……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Fire bird chirped in sorrow. But it still followed Qing Shui’s desire and didn’t dared to get closer.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo had begun to make his move. His speed was so fast to the point that it was difficult to follow with the naked eye.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could tell that both his speed and strength were rising rapidly. As of now, he has already achieved a terrifying speed. The dazzling light that emerged from his silver-white colored long sword made Qing Shui felt nervous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, he could also feel Feng Shamo giving out a distressing, blood-thirsty and lonely aura. The unpeaceful aura forced Qing Shui to stop what he was doing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui who released his spiritual sense could clearly sense Feng Shamo’s body slowly withering.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What kind of a technique is this Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow? Is he trying to kill himself? Or does he want to die together with me?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The time in which Qing Shui could stay in the Realm of Violet Jade was running out. But he could still feel an intimidating pressure approaching and a sword aura so frightening that it made his whole body tighten up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Minute Subtlety!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui sensed a level of cultivation he never felt before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui locked his eyes at Feng Shamo’s long sword which was approaching like a meteor shower. The sword was heading directly towards his heart!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he wouldn’t be able to defend against the attack no matter what he did. Nor would he be able to avoid it. At this moment, both Feng Shamo’s speed and attack had achieved a very high level which Qing Shui could only look up at.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That came with the cost of burning himself!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ka!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the instant before the long sword pierced through Qing Shui’s Golden Ringed Armor, his whole body shaked at a speed almost invisible to the naked eye.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ka!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui got pierced directly by the long sword! His whole body got blown backward along with the sword in his body. At the same time, mouthfuls of fresh blood was seen coming out of his mouth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo quietly stood on the spot where Qing Shui previously was. He stayed frozen there for a while. After that, he slowly fell backwards like a withered old tree.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu-Tong!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Both Feng Shamo and Qing Shui fell down to the ground at almost the same time!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Merely in one breaths time, Qing Shui had almost been dyed completely red by his own blood.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seconds before Qing Shui regained his consciousness, he could hear a lot of people calling out for him, Huoyun Liu-Li, Canghai Mingyue, Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui felt as if he went back to his previous incarnation. He saw his parents who have aged, his big brother and his big sister…… It felt as if he had gone back to the time when he was still a child. Everyone in the family was always spoiling him by letting him do as he wanted. After all, he was the youngest of the family.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, the incidents which left deep impressions in Qing Shui appeared one by one. Up until the time when he went to university, he had always felt really passive and inferior to others. But it was exactly at that time when a woman walked into his world.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was beautiful, thoughtful and considerate. The two’s relationships had always been in between the boundaries of being friends and lovers until the time when he confessed his feelings to her. That was the time when he truly established a relationship with her. That time was the most unforgettable moment of his life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But he who was addicted to online games at that time didn’t appreciate it. He was so obsessed with it to the extent that he didn’t even spare any time to talk to her on the phone. A lot of the relationships between university students were a waste of time. They didn’t have money, nor did they have the time to be in contact with each other. Without these, the relationship would basically have been non-existent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s a love that was meant to wither as soon as it sprouted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It might have been his punishment, it might have also been a kind of compensation, but Qing Shui got shocked by electricity and passed away. His soul passed through the passage of time and went back to the World of the Nine Continents. At this very moment, Qing Shui told himself that he had to stop being depressed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The scene changed yet again. It went back to the time when Qing Shui was still young and lived with his mother Qing Yi. Up till the time he was capable of cultivating martial arts and obtained the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he has always been regarded as trash by others.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During that time, he found out about his mother’s past. Since that moment, Qing Shui has always wanted to obliterate Yan Clan. He felt that he needed to do it no matter what, so he cultivated hard since the very beginning. He didn’t rest for even a day.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meeting Shi Qingzhuang, meeting Wenren Wu-shuang, meeting Yu He, Yu Donghao, incurring hatred with Situ clan in Hundred Miles City and Gong Yang Clan in Heavenly River City as well as murdering a Xiantian warrior for the first time…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meeting Yiye Jiange and advancing to the Xiantian stage, entering the Skysword Sect and being promoted to be an elder…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meeting Canghai Mingyue, the Green Cloud Continent…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of these scenes appeared one after another like he was looking at lights while riding on a horseback.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Destroying the Yan Clan and realizing his mother’s wish…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mother!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about the woman in Hundred Miles City who had always been thinking about him and cared about him in every possible way. The closest person to him in his entire life, the woman who he his mother…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Am I dead?” Qing Shui has finally remembered his battle with Feng Shamo. At the most crucial moment, Qing Shui used the “Minute Subtlety”. Even though at that moment, it looked like Qing Shui only trembled, but at the time when Feng Shamo’s sword entered his body, it was that very tremble which enabled him to avoid the sword by a bit.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I cannot die……” Qing Shui thought about his mother who was still in Hundred Miles City. He thought about a lot of people.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly opened up both of his eyes. His entire body felt really painful like it was about to tear about. He noticed that he was in a room which he was unfamiliar with. It was a really ordinary room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, I feel like I have been here before.” Qing Shui looked around and felt that this place was a bit familiar.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mo Yan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mo Yayan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finally remembered. This was precisely the place where he stayed for a short time in order to wrap up his injuries. It seemed like Doctor Mo worked here. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he could hear the sound of footsteps walking in from outside.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li rubbed her eyes as she walked towards Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that Huoyun Liu-Li had woken up just a moment ago. Her hair looked a bit messy, but it made her look a bit more womanly. Qing Shui smiled as he looked at her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards Qing Shui. When she saw that Qing Shui had opened his eyes and even smiled at her, she didn’t have much reaction. She just continued to walk towards Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She rubbed her eyes: “My eyes must have been too tired, I haven’t been sleeping for one week. Just when I finally got to sleep, it got fuzzy.” Said Huoyun Liu-Li while she shook her head and slapped her face with her hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, he felt a sense of warmth in his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Huh? Is this just my illusion or is this real?” Said Huoyun Liu-Li as she touched Qing Shui’s forehead with her hand.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s not hot anymore!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly grabbed the lily-white hand placed on his forehead.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li trembled. She looked at Qing Shui. Now, she didn’t know if it’s her who was hallucinating, or Qing Shui had really woken up. As she looked at Qing Shui, her pupils started to turn red at a speed visible to the naked eyes. Tears began to fill up her eyes. After that, it began to drop like pearls that had their strings snapped.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, why are you……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue walked in with a towel and a washbowl and saw Huoyun Liu-Li standing at the side of the bed motionless. Qing Shui’s head and shoulders happened to be blocked by Huoyun Liu-Li. Hence, Canghai Mingyue didn’t notice that Qing Shui had woken up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s just that before she managed to ask anything, she had already seen Qing Shui looking at her with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue, despite being an independent and strong-willed woman, her eyes too immediately became wet. A joyful smile appeared on her face. It’s just that she couldn’t get herself to say even one word.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yueyue, Liu-Li, sit down, I really feel like talking to someone at the moment.” Qing Shui has never been this happy before. He felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart, he was already content with what he had now. Even during the time when he passed through the passage of time to the World of the Nine Continents and when he destroyed Yan Clan, Qing Shui had also not felt as happy as he was now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue carried the washbowl and walked to the side of Qing Shui’s bed. She placed the washbowl on a chair next to the bed. Half of the bowl was filled up with clear water.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You freaking scoundrel, you only know how to scare us! It’s the first time sister and I have served someone like this.” Huoyun Liu-Li tooted her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly. He lowered his head and took a look at the thin blanket on his body. Every time when he moved, he would feel as if his body was falling apart: “How long have I been sleeping for?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Seven days!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Said Canghai Mingyue while dipping the towel into the warm water. After wringing it dry, she looked back at Qing Shui and felt a bit nervous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But very quickly, she begun to wipe Qing Shui’s face skillfully. Qing Shui kept his eyes open as he looked at the beautiful face in front of him. The perplexing eyes were like the most beautiful stars. Her long and thick eyelashes were really straight. It may not be curled in the kind of sexy way, but in Qing Shui’s eyes, there was an indescribable kind of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a bit of a blush on her gorgeous face. But very quickly, she has already finished wiping Qing Shui’s face. She once again took up the washbowl and cleaned the towel.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She held up one of Qing Shui’s hand and wiped it slowly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The more she lowered down her beautiful face, the more curled her long eyelashes would look. As Qing Shui looked at her from this angle, he got stunned by her beauty that was like an illusion. However, what he felt more was a sense of warmth.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had imagined himself taking care of the women he liked.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He has also thought about being looked after by a woman he loved……. Hence, Qing Shui got a bit distracted when he looked at Canghai Mingyue.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the time when he was distracted, she was already done wiping his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue brought down the towel in the washbowl.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt a wave of emotions. It has always been said that one who survives a great disaster is destined to good fortune for ever after. This saying was indeed true. It was not as if someone survived, the sky would rain down meat pies for him. It’s just that as someone experienced a situation of life and death, it would make them understand more things. At the moment of life and death, a lot of things which they have hesitated to do and were yet to reach conclusions for would become insignificant and they would also have had a clue about how to solve it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li sat beside Qing Shui’s head whereas Canghai Mingyue sat beside his waist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s right hand gently grabbed Huoyun Liu-Li’s hand. After that, he went on to grab one of Canghai Mingyue’s hands. At that moment, Qing Shui was grabbing two women’s hands with just his right hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The three hands were tightly held together. After experiencing this incident, Qing Shui had understood a lot. He has also let go of a lot of things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Exactly at this moment, another woman walked in.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mo Yan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could still recognize her. She was still the same as before. She still had a moody look. Her beautiful and pure pupils were still indifferent like usual. She looked at him with her pink-colored mouth tightly closed.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 478 - The Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow. The uses of Minute Subtlety. A narrow escape!</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">His entire hand rapidly turned a bloody red. It looked incomparably weird.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Feng Clan’s Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He has gone nuts!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This time, Qing Shui is done for!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Everything is going to be over!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, what shall we do? What can we do?” Huoyun Liu-Li anxiously looked at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue has always been Huoyun Liu-Li’s support. Back in Canglang Country, as long as Canghai Mingyue was there, who would have dared to pick on her? She subconsciously asked Canghai Mingyue who was next to her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue bit her lips. Both of her hands were grasped together tightly, so tight that she didn’t even know that the skin of her palms got peeled off. The only thing she did was looking back at Chang Wuya and the others who were not so far away from her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuyan smiled bitterly as he shook his head at them:” it's too late……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Fire bird chirped in sorrow. But it still followed Qing Shui’s desire and didn’t dared to get closer.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo had begun to make his move. His speed was so fast to the point that it was difficult to follow with the naked eye.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could tell that both his speed and strength were rising rapidly. As of now, he has already achieved a terrifying speed. The dazzling light that emerged from his silver-white colored long sword made Qing Shui felt nervous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, he could also feel Feng Shamo giving out a distressing, blood-thirsty and lonely aura. The unpeaceful aura forced Qing Shui to stop what he was doing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui who released his spiritual sense could clearly sense Feng Shamo’s body slowly withering.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What kind of a technique is this Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow? Is he trying to kill himself? Or does he want to die together with me?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The time in which Qing Shui could stay in the Realm of Violet Jade was running out. But he could still feel an intimidating pressure approaching and a sword aura so frightening that it made his whole body tighten up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Minute Subtlety!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui sensed a level of cultivation he never felt before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui locked his eyes at Feng Shamo’s long sword which was approaching like a meteor shower. The sword was heading directly towards his heart!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he wouldn’t be able to defend against the attack no matter what he did. Nor would he be able to avoid it. At this moment, both Feng Shamo’s speed and attack had achieved a very high level which Qing Shui could only look up at.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That came with the cost of burning himself!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ka!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the instant before the long sword pierced through Qing Shui’s Golden Ringed Armor, his whole body shaked at a speed almost invisible to the naked eye.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ka!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui got pierced directly by the long sword! His whole body got blown backward along with the sword in his body. At the same time, mouthfuls of fresh blood was seen coming out of his mouth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo quietly stood on the spot where Qing Shui previously was. He stayed frozen there for a while. After that, he slowly fell backwards like a withered old tree.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu-Tong!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Both Feng Shamo and Qing Shui fell down to the ground at almost the same time!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Merely in one breaths time, Qing Shui had almost been dyed completely red by his own blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seconds before Qing Shui regained his consciousness, he could hear a lot of people calling out for him, Huoyun Liu-Li, Canghai Mingyue, Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui felt as if he went back to his previous incarnation. He saw his parents who have aged, his big brother and his big sister…… It felt as if he had gone back to the time when he was still a child. Everyone in the family was always spoiling him by letting him do as he wanted. After all, he was the youngest of the family.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After that, the incidents which left deep impressions in Qing Shui appeared one by one. Up until the time when he went to university, he had always felt really passive and inferior to others. But it was exactly at that time when a woman walked into his world.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was beautiful, thoughtful and considerate. The two’s relationships had always been in between the boundaries of being friends and lovers until the time when he confessed his feelings to her. That was the time when he truly established a relationship with her. That time was the most unforgettable moment of his life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But he who was addicted to online games at that time didn’t appreciate it. He was so obsessed with it to the extent that he didn’t even spare any time to talk to her on the phone. A lot of the relationships between university students were a waste of time. They didn’t have money, nor did they have the time to be in contact with each other. Without these, the relationship would basically have been non-existent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s a love that was meant to wither as soon as it sprouted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It might have been his punishment, it might have also been a kind of compensation, but Qing Shui got shocked by electricity and passed away. His soul passed through the passage of time and went back to the World of the Nine Continents. At this very moment, Qing Shui told himself that he had to stop being depressed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The scene changed yet again. It went back to the time when Qing Shui was still young and lived with his mother Qing Yi. Up till the time he was capable of cultivating martial arts and obtained the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he has always been regarded as trash by others.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During that time, he found out about his mother’s past. Since that moment, Qing Shui has always wanted to obliterate Yan Clan. He felt that he needed to do it no matter what, so he cultivated hard since the very beginning. He didn’t rest for even a day.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Meeting Shi Qingzhuang, meeting Wenren Wu-shuang, meeting Yu He, Yu Donghao, incurring hatred with Situ clan in Hundred Miles City and Gong Yang Clan in Heavenly River City as well as murdering a Xiantian warrior for the first time…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Meeting Yiye Jiange and advancing to the Xiantian stage, entering the Skysword Sect and being promoted to be an elder…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Meeting Canghai Mingyue, the Green Cloud Continent…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of these scenes appeared one after another like he was looking at lights while riding on a horseback.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Destroying the Yan Clan and realizing his mother’s wish…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mother!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about the woman in Hundred Miles City who had always been thinking about him and cared about him in every possible way. The closest person to him in his entire life, the woman who he his mother…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Am I dead?” Qing Shui has finally remembered his battle with Feng Shamo. At the most crucial moment, Qing Shui used the “Minute Subtlety”. Even though at that moment, it looked like Qing Shui only trembled, but at the time when Feng Shamo’s sword entered his body, it was that very tremble which enabled him to avoid the sword by a bit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I cannot die……” Qing Shui thought about his mother who was still in Hundred Miles City. He thought about a lot of people.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly opened up both of his eyes. His entire body felt really painful like it was about to tear about. He noticed that he was in a room which he was unfamiliar with. It was a really ordinary room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, I feel like I have been here before.” Qing Shui looked around and felt that this place was a bit familiar.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mo Yan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mo Yayan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finally remembered. This was precisely the place where he stayed for a short time in order to wrap up his injuries. It seemed like Doctor Mo worked here. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he could hear the sound of footsteps walking in from outside.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li rubbed her eyes as she walked towards Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that Huoyun Liu-Li had woken up just a moment ago. Her hair looked a bit messy, but it made her look a bit more womanly. Qing Shui smiled as he looked at her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards Qing Shui. When she saw that Qing Shui had opened his eyes and even smiled at her, she didn’t have much reaction. She just continued to walk towards Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She rubbed her eyes: “My eyes must have been too tired, I haven’t been sleeping for one week. Just when I finally got to sleep, it got fuzzy.” Said Huoyun Liu-Li while she shook her head and slapped her face with her hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, he felt a sense of warmth in his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Huh? Is this just my illusion or is this real?” Said Huoyun Liu-Li as she touched Qing Shui’s forehead with her hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s not hot anymore!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly grabbed the lily-white hand placed on his forehead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li trembled. She looked at Qing Shui. Now, she didn’t know if it’s her who was hallucinating, or Qing Shui had really woken up. As she looked at Qing Shui, her pupils started to turn red at a speed visible to the naked eyes. Tears began to fill up her eyes. After that, it began to drop like pearls that had their strings snapped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, why are you……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue walked in with a towel and a washbowl and saw Huoyun Liu-Li standing at the side of the bed motionless. Qing Shui’s head and shoulders happened to be blocked by Huoyun Liu-Li. Hence, Canghai Mingyue didn’t notice that Qing Shui had woken up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s just that before she managed to ask anything, she had already seen Qing Shui looking at her with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue, despite being an independent and strong-willed woman, her eyes too immediately became wet. A joyful smile appeared on her face. It’s just that she couldn’t get herself to say even one word.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yueyue, Liu-Li, sit down, I really feel like talking to someone at the moment.” Qing Shui has never been this happy before. He felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart, he was already content with what he had now. Even during the time when he passed through the passage of time to the World of the Nine Continents and when he destroyed Yan Clan, Qing Shui had also not felt as happy as he was now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue carried the washbowl and walked to the side of Qing Shui’s bed. She placed the washbowl on a chair next to the bed. Half of the bowl was filled up with clear water.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You freaking scoundrel, you only know how to scare us! It’s the first time sister and I have served someone like this.” Huoyun Liu-Li tooted her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly. He lowered his head and took a look at the thin blanket on his body. Every time when he moved, he would feel as if his body was falling apart: “How long have I been sleeping for?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Seven days!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Said Canghai Mingyue while dipping the towel into the warm water. After wringing it dry, she looked back at Qing Shui and felt a bit nervous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But very quickly, she begun to wipe Qing Shui’s face skillfully. Qing Shui kept his eyes open as he looked at the beautiful face in front of him. The perplexing eyes were like the most beautiful stars. Her long and thick eyelashes were really straight. It may not be curled in the kind of sexy way, but in Qing Shui’s eyes, there was an indescribable kind of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a bit of a blush on her gorgeous face. But very quickly, she has already finished wiping Qing Shui’s face. She once again took up the washbowl and cleaned the towel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She held up one of Qing Shui’s hand and wiped it slowly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The more she lowered down her beautiful face, the more curled her long eyelashes would look. As Qing Shui looked at her from this angle, he got stunned by her beauty that was like an illusion. However, what he felt more was a sense of warmth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had imagined himself taking care of the women he liked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He has also thought about being looked after by a woman he loved……. Hence, Qing Shui got a bit distracted when he looked at Canghai Mingyue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the time when he was distracted, she was already done wiping his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue brought down the towel in the washbowl.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt a wave of emotions. It has always been said that one who survives a great disaster is destined to good fortune for ever after. This saying was indeed true. It was not as if someone survived, the sky would rain down meat pies for him. It’s just that as someone experienced a situation of life and death, it would make them understand more things. At the moment of life and death, a lot of things which they have hesitated to do and were yet to reach conclusions for would become insignificant and they would also have had a clue about how to solve it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li sat beside Qing Shui’s head whereas Canghai Mingyue sat beside his waist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s right hand gently grabbed Huoyun Liu-Li’s hand. After that, he went on to grab one of Canghai Mingyue’s hands. At that moment, Qing Shui was grabbing two women’s hands with just his right hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The three hands were tightly held together. After experiencing this incident, Qing Shui had understood a lot. He has also let go of a lot of things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Exactly at this moment, another woman walked in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mo Yan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could still recognize her. She was still the same as before. She still had a moody look. Her beautiful and pure pupils were still indifferent like usual. She looked at him with her pink-colored mouth tightly closed.&nbsp;</p>
