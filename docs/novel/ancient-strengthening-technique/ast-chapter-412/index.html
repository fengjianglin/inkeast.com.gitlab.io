 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">

  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 412 The Force of One Stomp, The Legendary Item Holy Bracelet</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that this situation was the result of the combination between the Diamond Qi and his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, but yet, they were not fully combined together. However, Qing Shui could already feel the thick streams of Diamond Qi giving him a strong gravitational force, though it did not affect his speed. The feeling of that power was so numbing that he felt very weird yet very happy at the same time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was the feeling of when he had gained immense powers!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The energy throughout his body was channeled and he suddenly stomped down with one foot!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a tremendous strength of over 3 million jin and the "Mighty Elephant Stomp" was able to increase his strength by 50% and five times the grounding effect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This stomp contained the tremendous power of over 15 million jin!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A deep sound rang out and with a series of huge tremors, cracks appeared on the surface, but they were quickly restored.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the self-recovery ability the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Haha!" Qing Shui broke into a loud laughter. This surprise came too quickly. Not only was he now equipped with the Mighty Elephant Stomp, but his strength was also increased by 50%, &nbsp;receiving an increment of 1.5million jin.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Divine Arm Clearing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used all the powers he had as he wished. If not for the strong self-recovery abilities he had whilst in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would probably be in a horrible state now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After he had quieted down, Qing Shui started to think of the reason why he could have brought the Diamond Qi to the large success stage in such a short time. In the end, he could only attribute it to the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Other than this, he could not think of any other reason.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the morning, when Qing Shui woke up for practice, he discovered that he was the latest. The rest were training hard, especially in the Tiger Form, which they had trained quite well in. Most of them had reached the large success stage in the Tiger Form.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still provided them with sufficient Spirit Concentrating Pills. Although they were of the lowest quality and could only make their one day cultivation worth two days, not everyone could do this in the world of the nine continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Other than one's own efforts, hard work and level of comprehension, a genius would also need a bit of luck and some heaven-defying items. For example, the Spirit Concentrating Pill which increased one's cultivation efforts by six times. It would mean that thirty plus years worth of cultivation would be equivalent to an ordinary person's one hundred and eighty years of cultivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Other than that, there was also the "Holy Bracelet" which was six times stronger than the Spirit Concentrating Pills, giving one about ten times the result of their usual cultivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that there were too few of such amazing items. Just a single "Holy Bracelet" was sufficient to send all the cultivators in the world to fight each other for it. The value of this item was even greater than martial arts of the Divine Realms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought that it would be good if he could have a Holy Bracelet. He then thought that he already had a Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, which was much better. Shaking his head, he told himself that one should not be too greedy, so hethrew away the distracting thoughts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He lifted his head to see that Qing Qing was holding a sword, standing there in a daze, frowning!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked over slowly, smiling as he took the sword from her hands, "What are you thinking about? I had saw you standing here for quite a while."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'm trying to recall the sword arts my father taught me when I was young, but I realized that I cannot remember them," she replied dejectedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Come, elder sister, I'll show you a set of sword technique. This is also the one I use. It's very simple, but it has defeated quite a number of Martial King cultivators." Qing Shui diverted Qing Qing's attention.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Basic Sword Technique which was at the level of One with Heaven when displayed, everyone could tell that this was the most basic of the Basic Sword Techniques, but they appeared completely different in Qing Shui's hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Performing with great skill as if one was clumsy, One with Heaven, returning to nature!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Isn't this the Basic Sword Technique?" Qing Qing looked at Qing Shui, surprised, disbelief reflecting in her eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's right. Each martial arts or technique would have their own value and their own uniqueness. Are you interested in learning this Basic Sword Techniques?"Qing Shui handed Qing Qing the sword, asking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I am. This seems very easy to pick up, but why is it that I've never seen anyone who's able to perform the Basic Sword Techniques to such a level?" Qing Qing asked Qing Shui, puzzled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Practice makes perfect. Sister, listen to your younger brother. Practice this set of &nbsp;Basic Sword Techniques for a thousand times every day and put in a lot of effort, alright?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mmm mmm, I'll listen to you," Qing Qing said with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Shui, you're biased. Why do you only teach Sister Qing Qing and not us?" Qing Bei walked over, pouting.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I knew you'd say this. I've taught you guys this long ago, but it seems that you guys are not suitable for this. When has your Brother Shui been stingy with you? Haven't I remembered and shared all the good things?" Qing Shui patted Qing Bei's head gently and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Why am I not suitable?" Qing Bei smiled, too.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You've already learned other sword techniques, and the things that you'd learnt before are all over the place. Moreover, you're already past the stage of such tough repetitive training."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Oh, then is Sister Qing suitable for this training method?" Qing Bei asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded and smiled, "Mmm, your Sister Qing basically has not cultivated any martial arts before with the exception of a set of martial technique. Once a person cultivated other sword techniques, they would no longer be suited to cultivate this Basic Sword Technique. Or at least, they won't be able to reach a high level of cultivation. It was because it would be hard for their mind to sink into the moves of the Basic Sword Technique. Just like how after a person is used to wearing beautiful clothes, it would never be natural for him to put on ragged clothes. But if it was a person who never had any clothes to begin with, when given ragged clothes, the person would be able to wear them well. It was because it would let the person appear better than before, and it would be more natural on him as well."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I don't care, Brother Shui, you must teach me a power technique, alright?" Qing Bei shook Qing Shui's arm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, alright. You go tell the others that I'll be teaching you guys something in a while," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Sister, let me tell you about this Basic Sword Techniques. While it is the most basic stuff, but I've practiced no less than ten million times. I can share with you some things which will make it easier for you when you learn," Qing Shui smiled and said, before he grabbed onto Qing Qing's hand which was holding onto the sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Swoosh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sword thrusted out in a straight line!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Sister, you only need to feel the movements while listening to what I have to say. The sword is a sharp weapon, and the purpose of a battle is to protect yourself and defeat the opponent. If you can defeat your opponent in the time taken for one breath, don't do it within two breaths, especially in a fight to the death. Look for the most direct, fastest, most accurate, and harshest points."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui taught the others the "Core Qi Method" from the "Black Armored Jumping King" and the Back Connecting Fist which he had comprehended from the stone monuments. As long as they were able to train to the small success stage, their abilities would be able to increase by quite a lot.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not being selfish towards them, but it was because they did not have the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal like he did. Being too greedy would make it hard to chew down all the food. It would not be good for them if Qing Shui taught them too many things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the morning, Qing Shui did not have anything to do and planned to head out for a walk. It had been very long since he felt so relaxed. After all, he has removed the Yan Clan which had been troubling them. As for the issues with the Lion King's Ridge and the Sword Tower, they were not something he would be able to accomplish within a day or two. For them, Qing Shui had also decided on his plans.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Five years for one, twenty years for another!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed that it was as if he had always been living for revenge. But no matter what, it was fine as long as he lived a fulfilling and meaningful life. It was sufficient to be able to live a life without regrets.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But how many people would be able to live without any regrets? Qing Shui shook his head, telling himself not to think too much into it. If he did, he would feel an uncontrollable rage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at the various people on the streets, he strolled along without a goal, occasionally looking at the beautiful ladies passing by.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sometimes, they would look at this man who was alone, and might even talk between themselves. Qing Shui could even hear what they were saying.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked towards them, they would stick out their tongues playfully and run off.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he lifted his head, he discovered that he had unknowingly made his way to Yu He Inn. After a short daze, Qing Shui walked in and headed upstairs. The memories of the times he had shared with Yu He and her beautiful figure appeared in his mind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This restaurant was no longer called Yu He Inn. Qing Shui guessed that it must have been sold to someone else. He looked for a window seat in the hall on the 2nd level.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, two dishes and a pot of wine were served. Qing Shui did not came here for food, but had came to adjust his feelings.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking out the window, Qing Shui would had a peaceful feeling when he looked down on the passing crowd. It was just that very quickly, his gaze was fixed on someone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was because he had seen someone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yu He!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was similarly walking about in the streets, depressed, without a goal, or rather, taking a stroll. Qing Shui saw that she was not as well-rounded as before. Her waist and legs were thinner, and it felt as if even her bones were thinner now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was truly what it meant to be a bag of bones!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, she appeared to be more elegant than before, her breasts perked up, and even her bosom was more rounded and sexy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When she walked to Yu He Inn's entrance, she stopped, and then slowly walked in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's smile appeared to be slightly bitter and happy. He felt that his feelings were currently very contradicting.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Yu He appeared before him looking astonished, Qing Shui chuckled and stood up, "What a coincidence, Sister Yu."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yu He was stuck in a daze for quite a while before she smiled and look at Qing Shui. "It's really such a coincidence. It's really not easy to want to meet Young Master Qing now. Today, I'll play the host and treat you to some drinks. What do you say?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui obviously could tell that there was a hint of blame in Yu He's voice. Qing Shui thought about how he had tainted many parts of her body previously, and was once very infatuated with her. Now, was he being heartless or giving her the cold shoulder because she was a widow?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head. He knew that that was not what he was thinking. Qing Shui's thoughts were not that old school. He only felt that he was not strong enough and was afraid to get her involved in trouble like how it was for Wenren Wugou and Mingyue Gelou...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's gaze fixed on Yu He, reflecting a painful struggle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Is it that difficult a decision?" Yu He looked at Qing Shui's pained eyes. She thought that Qing Shui was not willing to see her and instantly felt very bitter inside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui regained his composure and quickly apologized, "Sister Yu, what are you talking about? Let me treat you today. I'd always been missing you."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"He misses me..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These words kept repeating in Yu He's mind and she had the urge to cry. Regardless if his words were the truth or not, it was all worth it. From that day she had left Qing Clan, she had not thought of being together with him. This was for the best.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still provided them with sufficient Spirit Concentrating Pills. Although they were of the lowest quality and could only make their one day cultivation worth two days, not everyone could do this in the world of the nine continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Other than one's own efforts, hard work and level of comprehension, a genius would also need a bit of luck and some heaven-defying items. For example, the Spirit Concentrating Pill which increased one's cultivation efforts by six times. It would mean that thirty plus years worth of cultivation would be equivalent to an ordinary person's one hundred and eighty years of cultivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Other than that, there was also the "Holy Bracelet" which was six times stronger than the Spirit Concentrating Pills, giving one about ten times the result of their usual cultivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that there were too few of such amazing items. Just a single "Holy Bracelet" was sufficient to send all the cultivators in the world to fight each other for it. The value of this item was even greater than martial arts of the Divine Realms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought that it would be good if he could have a Holy Bracelet. He then thought that he already had a Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, which was much better. Shaking his head, he told himself that one should not be too greedy, so hethrew away the distracting thoughts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He lifted his head to see that Qing Qing was holding a sword, standing there in a daze, frowning!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked over slowly, smiling as he took the sword from her hands, "What are you thinking about? I had saw you standing here for quite a while."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'm trying to recall the sword arts my father taught me when I was young, but I realized that I cannot remember them," she replied dejectedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Come, elder sister, I'll show you a set of sword technique. This is also the one I use. It's very simple, but it has defeated quite a number of Martial King cultivators." Qing Shui diverted Qing Qing's attention.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Basic Sword Technique which was at the level of One with Heaven when displayed, everyone could tell that this was the most basic of the Basic Sword Techniques, but they appeared completely different in Qing Shui's hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Performing with great skill as if one was clumsy, One with Heaven, returning to nature!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Isn't this the Basic Sword Technique?" Qing Qing looked at Qing Shui, surprised, disbelief reflecting in her eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's right. Each martial arts or technique would have their own value and their own uniqueness. Are you interested in learning this Basic Sword Techniques?"Qing Shui handed Qing Qing the sword, asking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I am. This seems very easy to pick up, but why is it that I've never seen anyone who's able to perform the Basic Sword Techniques to such a level?" Qing Qing asked Qing Shui, puzzled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Practice makes perfect. Sister, listen to your younger brother. Practice this set of &nbsp;Basic Sword Techniques for a thousand times every day and put in a lot of effort, alright?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mmm mmm, I'll listen to you," Qing Qing said with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Shui, you're biased. Why do you only teach Sister Qing Qing and not us?" Qing Bei walked over, pouting.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I knew you'd say this. I've taught you guys this long ago, but it seems that you guys are not suitable for this. When has your Brother Shui been stingy with you? Haven't I remembered and shared all the good things?" Qing Shui patted Qing Bei's head gently and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Why am I not suitable?" Qing Bei smiled, too.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You've already learned other sword techniques, and the things that you'd learnt before are all over the place. Moreover, you're already past the stage of such tough repetitive training."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Oh, then is Sister Qing suitable for this training method?" Qing Bei asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded and smiled, "Mmm, your Sister Qing basically has not cultivated any martial arts before with the exception of a set of martial technique. Once a person cultivated other sword techniques, they would no longer be suited to cultivate this Basic Sword Technique. Or at least, they won't be able to reach a high level of cultivation. It was because it would be hard for their mind to sink into the moves of the Basic Sword Technique. Just like how after a person is used to wearing beautiful clothes, it would never be natural for him to put on ragged clothes. But if it was a person who never had any clothes to begin with, when given ragged clothes, the person would be able to wear them well. It was because it would let the person appear better than before, and it would be more natural on him as well."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I don't care, Brother Shui, you must teach me a power technique, alright?" Qing Bei shook Qing Shui's arm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, alright. You go tell the others that I'll be teaching you guys something in a while," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Sister, let me tell you about this Basic Sword Techniques. While it is the most basic stuff, but I've practiced no less than ten million times. I can share with you some things which will make it easier for you when you learn," Qing Shui smiled and said, before he grabbed onto Qing Qing's hand which was holding onto the sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Swoosh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sword thrusted out in a straight line!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Sister, you only need to feel the movements while listening to what I have to say. The sword is a sharp weapon, and the purpose of a battle is to protect yourself and defeat the opponent. If you can defeat your opponent in the time taken for one breath, don't do it within two breaths, especially in a fight to the death. Look for the most direct, fastest, most accurate, and harshest points."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui taught the others the "Core Qi Method" from the "Black Armored Jumping King" and the Back Connecting Fist which he had comprehended from the stone monuments. As long as they were able to train to the small success stage, their abilities would be able to increase by quite a lot.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not being selfish towards them, but it was because they did not have the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal like he did. Being too greedy would make it hard to chew down all the food. It would not be good for them if Qing Shui taught them too many things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the morning, Qing Shui did not have anything to do and planned to head out for a walk. It had been very long since he felt so relaxed. After all, he has removed the Yan Clan which had been troubling them. As for the issues with the Lion King's Ridge and the Sword Tower, they were not something he would be able to accomplish within a day or two. For them, Qing Shui had also decided on his plans.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Five years for one, twenty years for another!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed that it was as if he had always been living for revenge. But no matter what, it was fine as long as he lived a fulfilling and meaningful life. It was sufficient to be able to live a life without regrets.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But how many people would be able to live without any regrets? Qing Shui shook his head, telling himself not to think too much into it. If he did, he would feel an uncontrollable rage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at the various people on the streets, he strolled along without a goal, occasionally looking at the beautiful ladies passing by.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sometimes, they would look at this man who was alone, and might even talk between themselves. Qing Shui could even hear what they were saying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked towards them, they would stick out their tongues playfully and run off.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he lifted his head, he discovered that he had unknowingly made his way to Yu He Inn. After a short daze, Qing Shui walked in and headed upstairs. The memories of the times he had shared with Yu He and her beautiful figure appeared in his mind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This restaurant was no longer called Yu He Inn. Qing Shui guessed that it must have been sold to someone else. He looked for a window seat in the hall on the 2nd level.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, two dishes and a pot of wine were served. Qing Shui did not came here for food, but had came to adjust his feelings.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking out the window, Qing Shui would had a peaceful feeling when he looked down on the passing crowd. It was just that very quickly, his gaze was fixed on someone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was because he had seen someone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yu He!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was similarly walking about in the streets, depressed, without a goal, or rather, taking a stroll. Qing Shui saw that she was not as well-rounded as before. Her waist and legs were thinner, and it felt as if even her bones were thinner now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was truly what it meant to be a bag of bones!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, she appeared to be more elegant than before, her breasts perked up, and even her bosom was more rounded and sexy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When she walked to Yu He Inn's entrance, she stopped, and then slowly walked in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's smile appeared to be slightly bitter and happy. He felt that his feelings were currently very contradicting.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Yu He appeared before him looking astonished, Qing Shui chuckled and stood up, "What a coincidence, Sister Yu."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yu He was stuck in a daze for quite a while before she smiled and look at Qing Shui. "It's really such a coincidence. It's really not easy to want to meet Young Master Qing now. Today, I'll play the host and treat you to some drinks. What do you say?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui obviously could tell that there was a hint of blame in Yu He's voice. Qing Shui thought about how he had tainted many parts of her body previously, and was once very infatuated with her. Now, was he being heartless or giving her the cold shoulder because she was a widow?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head. He knew that that was not what he was thinking. Qing Shui's thoughts were not that old school. He only felt that he was not strong enough and was afraid to get her involved in trouble like how it was for Wenren Wugou and Mingyue Gelou...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's gaze fixed on Yu He, reflecting a painful struggle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Is it that difficult a decision?" Yu He looked at Qing Shui's pained eyes. She thought that Qing Shui was not willing to see her and instantly felt very bitter inside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui regained his composure and quickly apologized, "Sister Yu, what are you talking about? Let me treat you today. I'd always been missing you."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"He misses me..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These words kept repeating in Yu He's mind and she had the urge to cry. Regardless if his words were the truth or not, it was all worth it. From that day she had left Qing Clan, she had not thought of being together with him. This was for the best.</p>
