 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>273 - To Scold, To Kill, A Treasure Map Was Gained </strong></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui turned his head to look at the person who was staring at him. He couldn’t help but wince - it was Fu Xing of the Fu Clan and his son, as well as two burly middle aged men. Their gazes were particularly sharp and slightly hot when they were looking at the two women.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Especially Fu Long, who had been crippled by Qing Shui, he was looking at the latter with immense hatred in his eyes. However, Qing Shui just brushed it off and smiled back at him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li noticed Qing Shui’s pause. They looked over curiously and they were equally shocked, especially by the poisonous hateful glares that came from the father and son duo of the Fu Clan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li, who was wearing a veil that revealed only her pair of sexy and lustrous eyes, avoided meeting their eyes, especially the two middle aged men’s. Canghai Mingyue briefly glanced at them and then looked back at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, what do we do?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was dazed at the fact that Canghai Mingyue could still talk to him like that. He remembered that they were pretending to be &nbsp;husband and wife in front of the pair of father and son, but now, everything was meaningless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Brother Fu, those two women are still virgins. Us brothers only want those women as rewards. See what you can do,” said the burly middle aged man on the left who was silent all this time. Although it was a negotiation, the voice of his tone was very firm.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His voice was not loud, but it was loud enough for Qing Shui and the two women to hear!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although Qing Shui had the feeling that the two women were still naive and pure, he couldn’t help but glance at them when he heard the words of that man. After all, the two women had also heard that sentence. So Qing Shui skittishly glanced at them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui realized that although Canghai Mingyue had closed herself up, she never seemed to seal herself tightly enough, especially when it involved him. When he thought about it, he understood one of the main reasons.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After all, he had been in too many of her firsts. Every ambiguous words and action would leave a little indestructible imprint on her soul.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui achieved his aim. Canghai Mingyue would never be able to forget him no matter what. Even if she were to seal up her own heart, Qing Shui would also be sealed as part of it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui laughed. At least now he knew that she wouldn’t go to the extremes. He was worried about Canghai Mingyue at first after seeing the change in her. Now, he knew that as long as he lived, she would never be able to seal herself up completely.</span></p>
  <p><span style>And sometimes, Canghai Mingyue would zone out while looking at Qing Shui. She would unconsciously think about him. Reminiscing the past brought warmness to her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fu Xing frowned when he heard the words of those two burly middle aged men. After all, Canghai Mingyue was the daughter of Ruo Tong, and that woman was a forever an unhealed scar in his heart. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“My two uncles, can you not kill that brat? Just beat him half to death to cripple his cultivation and let your nephew handle the rest,” Fu Long respectfully requested of those two middle aged men. He really hated Qing Shui to the bones.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Good idea, good idea!” The two middle aged men looked at Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li lecherously, their eyes never left them once since the beginning.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fu Xing frowned even more. His original intention in hiring these two was to create trouble for Canghai and his wife, while they themselves were only here to take care of Qing Shui. They didn’t expect to be late, or even to receive news of Canghai and his wife’s deaths. Canghai was his brother and he was dead. The woman that he was once obsessed with, was dead too. His own son was crippled because of their daughter… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Now that they were left with only his daughter, was he going to let her fall into the hands of these two perverts? She would definitely be torn alive if she were to fall into their hands…</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My two brothers, this girl is Xiao Long’s fiancee. Please let her go. They are planning to get married by the end of this year,” Fu Xing carefully told the two.</span></p>
  <p><span style> “Do you think we are blind? Xiao Long is looking at them with such obvious hatred in his eyes. Besides, Xiao Long has made us a promise. We are here to help you today, you aren’t giving us this little face? Let alone the fact that she was not Xiao Long’s fiancee, even if she was, can’t we brothers borrow her for two days?” the middle aged man on the right, who had been quiet, said coldly. He was eyeing Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li hungrily, as if he couldn’t wait to devour them alive.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The expression on Fu Xing’s face twisted! He slightly lowered his head to hide the fury in his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>An obvious look of shock crossed Fu Long’s face as well. He realized that he no longer hated her that much when he found out that she was still unmarried. However, his hatred towards Qing Shui deepened even more. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I f**ked your mother, you piles of dog shit. Your father should have shot you all in your mother’s mouth back then,” Qing Shui really couldn’t hold it back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>……………</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li glanced at Qing Shui. Although it was out of spite, how could he be this vulgar… ?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s voice was not soft and they were on a bustling street. His single sentence turned many heads!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Such talent. Gotta remember it and go back to find those sons of bitches again.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That was more impressive than my mouth… ” a fat woman muttered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Such a handsome young fellow. I was even considering to wed my daughter to him. But his mouth is such a killer,” a middle aged woman with thick makeup said frivolously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Stupefied for a moment, the two middle aged men then looked at Qing Shui in anger: “Brat, no one has ever spoken like that to us, the Zhan Clan brothers. I was going to let you die with a complete body, but it seems like today, you need to get a taste of what is worse than death.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t even bother to care about their bluff. Most of them were just riding on their family’s coattails and they didn’t even live up to their names. Qing Shui, who was just passing through here, couldn’t care less about local gangsters like them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui sensed that the two Zhan Clan brothers were on a slightly higher level than Fu Xing, but they should only be Grade 1 Martial Kings. Nevertheless, characters of their caliber won’t be able to intimidate Qing Shui, who had single handedly killed Elder Ying and Elder Sung of the Immortal Sword Sect.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fu Xing was silent at this moment. He knew these two were wolves. It was easier to summon Buddha then to send it away. He was even hoping for Qing Shui to kill them both right now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, what should we do?” Huoyun Liu-Li questioned him softly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No worries, it’s just two shrimps. They won’t even be able to do much!” Qing Shui calmly said. To date, Qing Shui should not have any problems dealing with a Grade 1 Martial King. However, dealing with two would be a little challenging. But Qing Shui knew that he could defeat a few Grade 1 Martial Kings while being unscathed in a short amount of time if he were to cultivate to the peak of the 4th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was already prepared to return to the Hundred Miles City to spend two years building up to the peak of the 4th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Then, he would see if he had the luck to breakthrough the 5th Layer. And at the same time, he would practice alchemy and supervise the cultivation of the others from the Qing Clan. Then finally, he would return to Yan Jiang Country with his mother.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since they were heading to the Heavenly Palace, he would try his luck in learning both the Heavenly Thunder Slash and Divinity Protection, which offered protection that was worthy of the “Godly” title, with the Heavenly Palace’s Token which he got from Canghai.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had a hunch that Canghai’s position at the Heavenly Palace shouldn’t be too low, and the martial techniques of the Heavenly Palace were to be be kept confidential. Qing Shui knew that Canghai Mingyue’s techniques were imparted by her mother instead of Canghai. Judging from how Canghai doted on his daughter, he would have imparted his techniques onto his daughter if it weren’t for the restriction imposed on him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A strong waves of aura and pressure woke Qing Shui from his train of thoughts. He raised his head and saw the two men holding their weapons!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mountain Splitter Axe!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui realised that the opponents’ weapons were of a pair of gigantic Mountain Splitter Axes! Since each of them were wielding one from the pair, he had a hunch that their techniques must be cooperative types.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Under the astonished gazes of the others, Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword “appeared out of nowhere”. Simple, unsophisticated and heavy but definitely not a bit inferior to the Mountain Splitter Axe.</span></p>
  <p><span style>No one would have guessed that the slightly bigger Big Dipper Sword, which looked about two thousand jin in weight, was actually three thousand jin in weight. Qing Shui had studied it for awhile and he still couldn’t figure out what material it was forged out of.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After a period of practice, Qing Shui’s ability at lifting heavy as though light was considered to have considerable results.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A heated tiger roar was let loose at the opponents. At this very moment, not even a trace of Qing Shui’s Qi Aura was concealed. He struck out at the same moment that the Qi Aura dissipated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If they were going to fight, then there was no point in it dragging on! </span></p>
  <p><span style>Soaring Crane Steps!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Zhan Clan brothers had originally planned to take out Qing Shui with just one of them. However, as soon as Qing Shui had dissipated his Qi Aura, both of them were able to instantly get into the best defensive state together thanks to their countless experience fighting alongside of each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The expression on Fu Xing’s face changed instantly. “This brat has grown so powerful to this extent, just in this short period of not seeing him. I thought I would be able to withstand him myself.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>He gave a signal to Fu Long, then both of them slowly slipped away unnoticed, and they disappeared into the sea of crowds.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Father, will the Zhan Clan brothers just let us slip away like this? They are not good people,” Fu Long sat on the back of his falcon and said to Fu Xing worriedly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“They’re going to die. Even if they don’t, they won’t be able to find us anymore.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fu Long was flabbergasted…</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had to heavily damage one of the Zhan Clan brothers while dashing towards them. He took a Coldsteel Needle out with his left hand after he had dashed in the attack area of his opponents. It was his first time to actually using a hidden weapon, swift with haste. Not to subdue his enemies, but to save himself. The target was the eyes of the person standing behind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The moment Qing Shui flung it out, his Big Dipper Sword struck too, and he delivered a full blown Sword of Third Wave!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The purpose of the Coldsteel Needle wasn’t to injure his enemies but to wear them down. Qing Shui knew that none of them could perfectly withstand his Sword of Third Wave.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His sword was swift with fury and it struck on the weakest point of the Mountain Splitter Axe - the tip of the axe! That was the most powerless spot during the defensive state!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Bang bang bang! There were three continuous loud bangs!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Mountain Splitter Axe flew out of the opponent’s hand. Blood leaked from the corner of his mouth and the web of his thumb was completely ripped apart. He staggered a few steps back. But Qing Shui unrelentlessly increased his speed to the extremes and pierced forward with his Big Dipper Sword </span></p>
  <p><span style>The piercing of a sword from the Obscure Realm, forged with the Thousand Hammer Technique! A Rainbow-like sword!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ahhhh!” A yell of despair rang out!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui damaged his abdomen and slightly slashed downwards.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His testicles were cut!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The scream of despair was accompanied by blood pouring out of his wounds before he fainted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew immediately that he was not only a licentious person but he was also an immoral man just from listening to his words earlier. Judging from his age, he should have committed countless of sins by now. To take his life would be a light punishment. Since he wanted Qing Shui to have a taste of what was worse than death, he might as well let him have a taste of that.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Brother! Ah! I’ll kill you!” The remaining brother yelled something that greatly amused Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Ancient Strengthening Technique in his body was still circulating at a fast speed and he resisted the strike of the axe that was akin to a tempest. Qing Shui looked at the furious Martial King level expert in front of him, obvious fury could be seen in those red eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui shook his head and he delivered a magnificent hack. His right leg abruptly encircled his opponent as if it was a poisonous snake.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A Tiger Tailwhip Kick landed squarely on the top of his opponent’s head which immediately exploded. Foes as weak as them really could not stand a chance against Qing Shui. If there were two of them, Qing Shui might have to exert a bit of effort.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A brocade box with a brocade bag in it dropped out of the opponent’s body!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh, there’s something!” Qing Shui realized that although he had killed a few people already, and all of them being Martial King experts, he had forgotten to search their bodies for loot. There should at least be something precious on the body of a Xiantian Expert no matter how poor they were, much less a Martial King of beginner level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Thinking about it, he had killed a few Martial Kings. He wouldn’t be this speechless if he could stop thinking about it. To think that there was a time when he was forced by the City Lord of the Heavenly River City, who was a Xiantian warrior, to the extent of his whole family almost being ruined…</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui opened the brocade box and he discovered three compartments in it which held two porcelain bottles and a folded paper… A Beast Parchment!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui sought after prescriptions or Martial Techniques. After spreading the Beast Parchment open, he quickly folded it up again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stopped reading after seeing two words!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Treasure Map!”</span></p>

 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li, who was wearing a veil that revealed only her pair of sexy and lustrous eyes, avoided meeting their eyes, especially the two middle aged men’s. Canghai Mingyue briefly glanced at them and then looked back at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, what do we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was dazed at the fact that Canghai Mingyue could still talk to him like that. He remembered that they were pretending to be &nbsp;husband and wife in front of the pair of father and son, but now, everything was meaningless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Fu, those two women are still virgins. Us brothers only want those women as rewards. See what you can do,” said the burly middle aged man on the left who was silent all this time. Although it was a negotiation, the voice of his tone was very firm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice was not loud, but it was loud enough for Qing Shui and the two women to hear!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Qing Shui had the feeling that the two women were still naive and pure, he couldn’t help but glance at them when he heard the words of that man. After all, the two women had also heard that sentence. So Qing Shui skittishly glanced at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui realized that although Canghai Mingyue had closed herself up, she never seemed to seal herself tightly enough, especially when it involved him. When he thought about it, he understood one of the main reasons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, he had been in too many of her firsts. Every ambiguous words and action would leave a little indestructible imprint on her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui achieved his aim. Canghai Mingyue would never be able to forget him no matter what. Even if she were to seal up her own heart, Qing Shui would also be sealed as part of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui laughed. At least now he knew that she wouldn’t go to the extremes. He was worried about Canghai Mingyue at first after seeing the change in her. Now, he knew that as long as he lived, she would never be able to seal herself up completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And sometimes, Canghai Mingyue would zone out while looking at Qing Shui. She would unconsciously think about him. Reminiscing the past brought warmness to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Xing frowned when he heard the words of those two burly middle aged men. After all, Canghai Mingyue was the daughter of Ruo Tong, and that woman was a forever an unhealed scar in his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“My two uncles, can you not kill that brat? Just beat him half to death to cripple his cultivation and let your nephew handle the rest,” Fu Long respectfully requested of those two middle aged men. He really hated Qing Shui to the bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good idea, good idea!” The two middle aged men looked at Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li lecherously, their eyes never left them once since the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Xing frowned even more. His original intention in hiring these two was to create trouble for Canghai and his wife, while they themselves were only here to take care of Qing Shui. They didn’t expect to be late, or even to receive news of Canghai and his wife’s deaths. Canghai was his brother and he was dead. The woman that he was once obsessed with, was dead too. His own son was crippled because of their daughter… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that they were left with only his daughter, was he going to let her fall into the hands of these two perverts? She would definitely be torn alive if she were to fall into their hands…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My two brothers, this girl is Xiao Long’s fiancee. Please let her go. They are planning to get married by the end of this year,” Fu Xing carefully told the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Do you think we are blind? Xiao Long is looking at them with such obvious hatred in his eyes. Besides, Xiao Long has made us a promise. We are here to help you today, you aren’t giving us this little face? Let alone the fact that she was not Xiao Long’s fiancee, even if she was, can’t we brothers borrow her for two days?” the middle aged man on the right, who had been quiet, said coldly. He was eyeing Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li hungrily, as if he couldn’t wait to devour them alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression on Fu Xing’s face twisted! He slightly lowered his head to hide the fury in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An obvious look of shock crossed Fu Long’s face as well. He realized that he no longer hated her that much when he found out that she was still unmarried. However, his hatred towards Qing Shui deepened even more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I f**ked your mother, you piles of dog shit. Your father should have shot you all in your mother’s mouth back then,” Qing Shui really couldn’t hold it back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……………</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li glanced at Qing Shui. Although it was out of spite, how could he be this vulgar… ?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui’s voice was not soft and they were on a bustling street. His single sentence turned many heads!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such talent. Gotta remember it and go back to find those sons of bitches again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was more impressive than my mouth… ” a fat woman muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a handsome young fellow. I was even considering to wed my daughter to him. But his mouth is such a killer,” a middle aged woman with thick makeup said frivolously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stupefied for a moment, the two middle aged men then looked at Qing Shui in anger: “Brat, no one has ever spoken like that to us, the Zhan Clan brothers. I was going to let you die with a complete body, but it seems like today, you need to get a taste of what is worse than death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t even bother to care about their bluff. Most of them were just riding on their family’s coattails and they didn’t even live up to their names. Qing Shui, who was just passing through here, couldn’t care less about local gangsters like them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui sensed that the two Zhan Clan brothers were on a slightly higher level than Fu Xing, but they should only be Grade 1 Martial Kings. Nevertheless, characters of their caliber won’t be able to intimidate Qing Shui, who had single handedly killed Elder Ying and Elder Sung of the Immortal Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Xing was silent at this moment. He knew these two were wolves. It was easier to summon Buddha then to send it away. He was even hoping for Qing Shui to kill them both right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, what should we do?” Huoyun Liu-Li questioned him softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries, it’s just two shrimps. They won’t even be able to do much!” Qing Shui calmly said. To date, Qing Shui should not have any problems dealing with a Grade 1 Martial King. However, dealing with two would be a little challenging. But Qing Shui knew that he could defeat a few Grade 1 Martial Kings while being unscathed in a short amount of time if he were to cultivate to the peak of the 4th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was already prepared to return to the Hundred Miles City to spend two years building up to the peak of the 4th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Then, he would see if he had the luck to breakthrough the 5th Layer. And at the same time, he would practice alchemy and supervise the cultivation of the others from the Qing Clan. Then finally, he would return to Yan Jiang Country with his mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were heading to the Heavenly Palace, he would try his luck in learning both the Heavenly Thunder Slash and Divinity Protection, which offered protection that was worthy of the “Godly” title, with the Heavenly Palace’s Token which he got from Canghai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had a hunch that Canghai’s position at the Heavenly Palace shouldn’t be too low, and the martial techniques of the Heavenly Palace were to be be kept confidential. Qing Shui knew that Canghai Mingyue’s techniques were imparted by her mother instead of Canghai. Judging from how Canghai doted on his daughter, he would have imparted his techniques onto his daughter if it weren’t for the restriction imposed on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strong waves of aura and pressure woke Qing Shui from his train of thoughts. He raised his head and saw the two men holding their weapons!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mountain Splitter Axe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui realised that the opponents’ weapons were of a pair of gigantic Mountain Splitter Axes! Since each of them were wielding one from the pair, he had a hunch that their techniques must be cooperative types.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the astonished gazes of the others, Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword “appeared out of nowhere”. Simple, unsophisticated and heavy but definitely not a bit inferior to the Mountain Splitter Axe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one would have guessed that the slightly bigger Big Dipper Sword, which looked about two thousand jin in weight, was actually three thousand jin in weight. Qing Shui had studied it for awhile and he still couldn’t figure out what material it was forged out of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a period of practice, Qing Shui’s ability at lifting heavy as though light was considered to have considerable results.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A heated tiger roar was let loose at the opponents. At this very moment, not even a trace of Qing Shui’s Qi Aura was concealed. He struck out at the same moment that the Qi Aura dissipated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were going to fight, then there was no point in it dragging on! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Soaring Crane Steps!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Zhan Clan brothers had originally planned to take out Qing Shui with just one of them. However, as soon as Qing Shui had dissipated his Qi Aura, both of them were able to instantly get into the best defensive state together thanks to their countless experience fighting alongside of each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression on Fu Xing’s face changed instantly. “This brat has grown so powerful to this extent, just in this short period of not seeing him. I thought I would be able to withstand him myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave a signal to Fu Long, then both of them slowly slipped away unnoticed, and they disappeared into the sea of crowds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, will the Zhan Clan brothers just let us slip away like this? They are not good people,” Fu Long sat on the back of his falcon and said to Fu Xing worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re going to die. Even if they don’t, they won’t be able to find us anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Long was flabbergasted…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had to heavily damage one of the Zhan Clan brothers while dashing towards them. He took a Coldsteel Needle out with his left hand after he had dashed in the attack area of his opponents. It was his first time to actually using a hidden weapon, swift with haste. Not to subdue his enemies, but to save himself. The target was the eyes of the person standing behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Qing Shui flung it out, his Big Dipper Sword struck too, and he delivered a full blown Sword of Third Wave!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purpose of the Coldsteel Needle wasn’t to injure his enemies but to wear them down. Qing Shui knew that none of them could perfectly withstand his Sword of Third Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sword was swift with fury and it struck on the weakest point of the Mountain Splitter Axe - the tip of the axe! That was the most powerless spot during the defensive state!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang bang bang! There were three continuous loud bangs!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mountain Splitter Axe flew out of the opponent’s hand. Blood leaked from the corner of his mouth and the web of his thumb was completely ripped apart. He staggered a few steps back. But Qing Shui unrelentlessly increased his speed to the extremes and pierced forward with his Big Dipper Sword </span></p>
 <p><span style>The piercing of a sword from the Obscure Realm, forged with the Thousand Hammer Technique! A Rainbow-like sword!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhh!” A yell of despair rang out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui damaged his abdomen and slightly slashed downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His testicles were cut!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scream of despair was accompanied by blood pouring out of his wounds before he fainted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui knew immediately that he was not only a licentious person but he was also an immoral man just from listening to his words earlier. Judging from his age, he should have committed countless of sins by now. To take his life would be a light punishment. Since he wanted Qing Shui to have a taste of what was worse than death, he might as well let him have a taste of that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother! Ah! I’ll kill you!” The remaining brother yelled something that greatly amused Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ancient Strengthening Technique in his body was still circulating at a fast speed and he resisted the strike of the axe that was akin to a tempest. Qing Shui looked at the furious Martial King level expert in front of him, obvious fury could be seen in those red eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui shook his head and he delivered a magnificent hack. His right leg abruptly encircled his opponent as if it was a poisonous snake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Tiger Tailwhip Kick landed squarely on the top of his opponent’s head which immediately exploded. Foes as weak as them really could not stand a chance against Qing Shui. If there were two of them, Qing Shui might have to exert a bit of effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A brocade box with a brocade bag in it dropped out of the opponent’s body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, there’s something!” Qing Shui realized that although he had killed a few people already, and all of them being Martial King experts, he had forgotten to search their bodies for loot. There should at least be something precious on the body of a Xiantian Expert no matter how poor they were, much less a Martial King of beginner level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about it, he had killed a few Martial Kings. He wouldn’t be this speechless if he could stop thinking about it. To think that there was a time when he was forced by the City Lord of the Heavenly River City, who was a Xiantian warrior, to the extent of his whole family almost being ruined…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui opened the brocade box and he discovered three compartments in it which held two porcelain bottles and a folded paper… A Beast Parchment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui sought after prescriptions or Martial Techniques. After spreading the Beast Parchment open, he quickly folded it up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui stopped reading after seeing two words!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treasure Map!”</span></p>
