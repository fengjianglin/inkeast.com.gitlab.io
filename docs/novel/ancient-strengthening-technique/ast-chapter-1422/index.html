 <p><strong>AST 1422 - Powerful Blue Dragon, The Horror of Demon Lord and Hua Rumei</strong></p>
 <p>“Then, let’s begin while Divine Protection is still active.” Hua Rumei said gently as she looked at the woman.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out his Five String Zither. The Zither floated in front of Qing Shui, who then held it up with both hands.</p>
 <p>Clang clang!</p>
 <p>A powerful mystical force rose around the group. A wave of violent energy rippled through their bodies. It was the type of violence borne from their blood, the Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack’s urge to kill.</p>
 <p>Their defense, strength, and speed quickly rose, along with a several-fold increase in attack power that Qing Shui mainly wanted.</p>
 <p>If Old Turtle’s power increased by several-fold, they would definitely be able to hurt Blue Dragon.</p>
 <p>Clang clang!</p>
 <p>The sound of the Zither changed again and again, with each cycle bringing about new tones. Phoenix Cry (Retreat).</p>
 <p>Apart from being a power amplifying ability, by playing the Zither at Blue Dragon, it disrupted and reduced its power.</p>
 <p>“Let’s get to killing!” Qing Shui was the first to rush towards Blue Dragon.</p>
 <p>Flame of Icefire!</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon suddenly spat a blast of icefire at Qing Shui. Even though the icefire wasn’t big, it chilly to the bone. If one were to be hit by it, unthinkable consequences await.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>With a conscious move, Nine Continents Mountain appeared at Qing Shui’s side to intercept the sheet of icefire.</p>
 <p>Golden Sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Golden Sword, the sharpest and fastest of all swords. In the Five Elements, Gold defeats Water. The Golden Sword was the gold element in the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique, while Blue Dragon’s Ice belonged to the water element. Qing Shui attacked only Blue Dragon’s weak points: the eyes, the underbelly, and even it’s private part.</p>
 <p>This caused Blue Dragon to roar in pain. Both women were rendered speechless by Qing Shui’s way of fighting. It was underhanded, but effective.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Golden Sword was very different from before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continuously strummed Phoenix Cry, occasionally using the Golden Sword to strike out unexpectedly.</p>
 <p>Water Slash!</p>
 <p>Old Turtle moved excitedly, sending a giant blade of water slicing towards Blue Dragon</p>
 <p>“You’re supposed to just take the hits,” Blue Dragon said, fuming.</p>
 <p>Dragon Form Attack!</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon suddenly turned a deeper shade of blue. It’s body looked as if it were made of metal. A wave of force enveloped the group, promising total annihilation.</p>
 <p>This was Blue Dragon’s Sure Kill Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>The first target was Demon Lord!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body stiffened, unable to move.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Great Reversal!</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Paragon Strike!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Nine Palace Steps to swap places with Demon Lord. Even though they were trapped in place, but with the Nine Palace positionings surrounding the area, as Emperor, that ability could still be used. Unfortunately, that was it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Paragon Strike struck out with the force of 72 million suns.</p>
 <p>It looked as though Blue Dragon was being overpowered, but Blue Dragon had used it’s Sure Kill Heavenly Technique as well.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Even with Paragon Golden Armor on and Paragon Strike reducing the force of Blue Dragon’s attack, Qing Shui was still sent flying. Thankfully, the Paragon Strike had blocked most of the attack, nullifying Blue Dragon’s Sure Kill Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>A soft energy enveloped Qing Shui, bringing him down next to Demon Lord and Hua Rumei.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you alright?” Hua Rumei worriedly asked Qing Shui, who was spitting out blood.</p>
 <p>“No problem. This fellow still has a number of Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques. We will only be safe when he uses them up,” Qing Shui said with a bitter smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had used his trump card. The two women were surprised as well. That attack would have been to much for both women combined, let alone Qing Shui on his own.</p>
 <p>Roar! Roar!</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon’s roar shook the skies, filled with great rage. It started to circle in the air.</p>
 <p>Icefire Storm!</p>
 <p>A mysterious blue cloud filled the sky, filling everyone’s hearts with trepidation.</p>
 <p>“Burn and be destroyed!” Blue Dragon spat a large piece of icefire at the cloud, piercing it with a glittering gleam.</p>
 <p>A blue bolt of lightning shot through the sky. Bolts of lightning infused with icefire flashed haphazardly, creating a dangerous atmosphere.</p>
 <p>Divine Turtle Shield Qi!</p>
 <p>A solid transparent shield surrounded the group.</p>
 <p>Old Turtle’s Sure Kill Heavenly Technique!</p>
 <p>Strong False Gods had counters equivalent to Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques. Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques however, had lesser restrictions, making them trump cards.</p>
 <p>Divine Turtle Shield Qi blocked the icefire. Qing Shui’s group had many more Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques than Blue Dragon. With the shield to block Blue Dragon’s Techniques, victory was assured.</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon was furious. Its energy was reduced and it was unable to recover it’s Qi, not to mention its Techniques were being curbed. It only had half of it’s Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques left.</p>
 <p>Turtle Shell Divination!</p>
 <p>Suddenly Old Turtle used another Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>Even though their position remained unchanged, they seemed to enter a strange world. It was similar to the Nine Palace Positions, equivalent to using the Turtle Shell.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t a good place or a bad place. It was as though they were standing on a huge turtle shell. This was one of Old Turtle’s powerful Sure Kill Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>“Try to force it to that place, the red place,” Old Turtle said telepathically.</p>
 <p>Fire and water do not mix. The red place was a fire prison.</p>
 <p>Here, even Qing Shui dared not move about recklessly. Suddenly, he thought about Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Positioning!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried tacking on his Nine Palace Positioning. To his surprise, it actually worked. The dangerous areas were just like the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation within the Nine Palace Positioning.</p>
 <p>“Sister, try using your Nine Palace Steps,” Qing Shui said. Hua Rumei had only recently learned the Nine Palace Steps, so her hopes weren’t high.</p>
 <p>“When I trained with the Palace Lord, I only learned up to One Origin Step. If I’m lucky, I can manage up to Duality Steps,” Hua Rumei said with embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“That’s already very good. Try using One Origin Step. It will be slow, but it will allow you to move around this area freely,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei tried it. It actually worked, allowing her free movement. She looked gleefully at Qing Shui, then at Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon’s enormous body stretched menacingly towards Qing Shui’s group.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Banging sounds rang out like an explosion. The loud sounds hit like an invisible wall, dizzying and disorienting the group.</p>
 <p>Turtle Shell Divination will not last for long. The most they had would be fifteen minutes. They needed to move swiftly or they would have wasted their reprieve.</p>
 <p>Roar! Roar!</p>
 <p>“Quickly! Scatter!” Old Turtle voice rang out, while speedily carrying the group away.</p>
 <p>Dragon Reverse Scale!</p>
 <p>A blue light burst out from Blue Dragon, causing the Turtle Shell Divination to slowly shatter and disappear.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The giant explosive sound ripped apart the surrounding sky.</p>
 <p>“He actually used up his most powerful Sure Kill Heavenly Technique,” Hua Rumei said, sounding happy.</p>
 <p>“You will all die today!”</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon flew up into the sky. Locking on to Qing Shui, it spat a ball of icefire at him.</p>
 <p>Golden Sword!</p>
 <p>It was a scary thing to try to intercept.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon’s enormous body shot out once again, sending out a shower of sparks.</p>
 <p>The most direct method of attack was also the most effective. Only that could push the group to their limit. Due to the strength of the dragon race’s** and energy attacks, the only option was to avoid it.</p>
 <p>Old Turtle took one look and used his hill-like body to smash into it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used this moment to summon Fire Bird, Thunderous Beast and Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. ‘It was time’, he mused. What puzzled him was Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Hellfire Phoenix had not used their Sure Kill Heavenly Technique</p>
 <p>The power of Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Hellfire Phoenix was no lesser than the two women. The two women were astonished by the appearance of the three Demonic Beasts.</p>
 <p>The gigantic Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the shockingly pitch-black Hellfire Phoenix were especially blinding.</p>
 <p>Hellfire Phoenix wasn’t as strong as Blue Dragon, but it’s bloodline was slightly more powerful.</p>
 <p>Underworld Fireball!</p>
 <p>Phoenix Might!</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Might!</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt！</p>
 <p>Clang! Clang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui speedily strummed his Zither, Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack (Shield), directing it to Old Turtle.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to turn Old Turtle into a tank, allowing him to absorb Blue Dragon’s attacks. This would allow the others to focus on attacking Blue Dragon.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui was surprised to find that Demon Lord had secretly pulled out a meter long sword. It was blood red, to the point where one expected fresh blood to be dripping from it.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui stared, Demon Lord moved.</p>
 <p>Her body’s graceful movements didn’t look fast, but it was full of mystery.</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon began to panic. Even though Blue Dragon was stronger than Demon Lord, but it had misgivings about that blood red sword.</p>
 <p>“Devil Sword, Devil Slaying Weapon. You have a Devil Slaying Weapon!” Blue Dragon cried out in fear.</p>
 <p>Stab!</p>
 <p>Demon Lord’s longsword easily pierced Blue Dragon’s body.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The Devil Sword began to absorb Blue Dragon’s blood, while viciously ripping through it’s innards.</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon roared loudly. It suddenly curled it’s enormous body, intending to trap Demon Lord in it’s folds.</p>
 <p>Instead, Demon Lord pulled out her sword and easily dodged it, proceeding to stab another part of its body.</p>
 <p>…..</p>
 <p>“Look out!”</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon’s body suddenly shrunk by a third, creating a cage of air to trap Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>Draconic Ultimate Slaughter!</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon’s Sure Kill Heavenly Technique!</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Hua Rumei’s astonished face and, without hesitation, allowed Thunderous Beast to use Violet Lightning Strike.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he threw out the Treasure Hunting Pig.</p>
 <p>Break him!</p>
 <p>Treasure Hunting Pig unwaveringly rushed in, smashing several holes through Blue Dragon’s air cage.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast attacked Blue Dragon with a Violet Lightning Strike every time it recovered.</p>
 <p>Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</p>
 <p>Pierce!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui released several Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, which promptly made their way into the holes punched through by Treasure Hunting Pig, causing them to grow exponentially.</p>
 <p>Stab! Stab!</p>
 <p>Maybe it was the effect of Treasure Hunting Pig creating holes in Blue Dragon’s air cage. When the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines rushed through, it caused the air cage to blow apart.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Hua Rumei rushed in. Qing Shui was also shocked when he saw Hua Rumei’s weapon.</p>
 <p>Two blood red swords!</p>
 <p>The material was very similar to Demon Lord’s weapon!</p>
 <p>Stab! Stab!</p>
 <p>The two swords wrapped around her arms, all the way to their elbows. The blood red spectacle was a sight to behold. She was as quick and nimble as a leopard. With clean strikes, in Hua Rumei’s hands, the blades looked extremely sharp.</p>
 <p>Both blades easily pierced Blue Dragon’s body.</p>
