  <p><strong>AST 0073 – Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-Shuang</strong></p>
  <p><span style>“Elder sister be obedient okay, please pass me back my clothes…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang slightly froze, as she did not know whether she should react in anger or laughter. Eventually, she chose the latter as she laughed, and tossed the pile of clothes to Qing Shui before walking out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui hurriedly put on his clothes after he completed washing the filth off his body. Feeling extremely invigorated, he walked out of the training hall with a smile on his face.</span></p>
  <p><i><span style>Seems like the impurities in my body are getting increasingly smaller. The filth excreted by the previous impurity cleansing was black in color, while now it looks grey.</span></i><span style> &nbsp;Just thinking about it caused Qing Shui to be filled with joy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After he had put on his clothes Wenren Wu-Shuang returned, as she gazed at Qing Shui with a mysterious look in his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You actually spent half a day in enlightenment, but why have you not broken through to Xiantian?” Wenren Wu-Shuang asked, curiosity evident in her tone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Enlightenment?” Qing Shui asked in a daze.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang, paused, as if she was dumbstruck. It appeared that this little fellow still had no inkling that he just underwent a bout of enlightenment. Hei, what a retarded fellow, there were many who sought enlightenment their entire lives, but have never succeeded, and there is this little fellow in front of her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rolling her eyes, this fellow… he didn’t even know he had just experienced enlightenment. Truly, are the heavens blind? Or does he have the favor and assistance of some Heavenly Deities.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“En, you entered into the state of enlightenment earlier, to think that you would be so lucky!” A part of Wenren Wu-Shuang wanted to smile, while another part of her felt somewhat accomplished, after all, it was because of her actions that Qing Shui could enter into that special state.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, could I trouble you to help me again?” Qing Shui seriously asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the serious expression on Qing Shui face, Wenren Wu-Shuang couldn’t help but giggle, as she replied “Speak, no matter what, as long as Elder Sister could help, I would definitely help!”</span></p>
  <p><i><span style>God, seems like this woman before me got addicted to being called an elder sister.</span></i></p>
  <p><span style>“Could you knock on my head again, maybe this is the secret to attain Xiantian.” Qing Shui slowly extended his neck over, while making sure he sneakily sniffed at the magnolia-like fragrance of Wenren Wu-Shuang’s body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you believe I’ll hit you, you this big head ghost!” Wenwen Wu-Shuang couldn’t stop giggling as she extended her hand, and forcefully rapped onto Qing Shui’s head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ahh, do you really want me to die, women are truly venomous creatures” Qing Shui exaggeratedly acted as he cried out in mock pain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How does it feel? To think that you experienced enlightenment but did not break through to Xiantian. I assume that the benefits you’ve gotten should be pretty good!” Wenren Wu-Shuang curiously inquired.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I feel pretty good. I’m truly thankful to your precious little hand. Such grace, truly the epitome of femininity! With such a miraculous effect, how could I ever repay you. Ahh I know, sigh… There’s no choice, I will lower myself and marry you!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“……. dream on!” Three black lines appeared on the top of Wu-Shuang’s head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“C’mon gimme a chance, how do I begin to chase you? Give me a condition, no matter how harsh it is, it still represents a ray of hope for me. If not, then I will pine after you to the point of sickness!” To strike the snake, one must follow the rod. &nbsp;From his knowledge of his past world, Qing Shui knew that one of the tactics for chasing naive women, was to stick to them like a piece of sticky paper.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You brat, stop talking nonsense. Keke, 10 years. I will give you 10 years to defeat me. If you still like me then, I will allow you to chase me, but there’s no guarantee that I would fall for you.” Wenren Wu-Shuang replied, somewhat seriously, yet mixed with a hint of humor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Okay, 10 years. In these 10 years I won’t allow you to be with other disgusting males. If you fall in love with some others, when I’m stronger, I will surely snatch you back. By then, you are not allowed to cry okay! By the way, the best idea is for you to remain single for 10 years, till I get stronger!” Qing Shui shamelessly replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Pft, you still dare to continue, you best be careful I don’t beat you till you cry!” Wenren Wu-Shuang, unable to tolerate it anymore, decided to give Qing Shui a scolding.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the skies, Qing Shui knew that it was time for him to leave. The things that happened here today, still felt a bit surreal, he would definitely carve this day in his memories!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I should return, if not my family will be worried about me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The casual words by Qing Shui, caused Wu-Shuang to be slightly hurt. Qing Shui unintentionally noticed her downcast expressions. As a person with two lifetimes of experiences, Qing Shui could tell what people are thinking usually from their microexpressions. As for Wenren Wu-Shuang, she was just too innocent, her emotions were all fully on display on her face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Little Shuangshuang, next time, you can treat me as your friend, or even your kin, or even better, even as your man. However, you are not allowed to hit me anymore, okay. No matter what difficulties you face, I will try my best to resolve them for you!” Qing Shui seriously said, gazing into her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang slightly shuddered, but she did not reject Qing Shui. Maybe, she could feel the trace of tenderness in his heart. She only lightly smiled, as she reached out her hand and rubbed Qing Shui on his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ahh, touching my head, means you are taking advantage of me. Fine, since you are already mine, go on, take all the advantage you can, I’m a willing party.” Qing Shui grabbed hold of Wenren Wu-Shuang’s gentle hands and held them without letting go.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmmph, are you asking for a beating? This little fellow is taking advantage of me again!” Wenren Wu-Shuang pulled back her hand while lightly berating Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m already a man, not a little fellow…” Qing Shui replied, helplessly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>—</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui left the Night Fragrance Court, and when he turning his head to look at the beautiful lady in the window, he waved his hands in goodbye.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he came out, he could still hear the slapping “pa pa” sounds of doggystyle, and moans of pleasure escaping from the other rooms.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“F*ck! I want to do it too”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The interior of the Night Fragrant Court was clad in warmth, akin to spring, while outside on the streets, one had to suffer the chill of winter. Luckily, what Qing Shui cultivated, was the tempering of his body. The chill had no way to invade his system. </span></p>
  <p><span style>He came here unintentionally, but left here with joy in his heart. It was just as comfortable as playing with a buxom lady. However, what would Qing Shui know of sex? What he knew was only through second-hand information such as films and novels from his previous world. His only physical intimate experience was with Yu He. However, earlier when he held Wu-Shuang’s hands, the feeling was not bad, actually capable of making his heartbeat quicken.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Doing it with Wu-Shuang, should be extremely comfortable right?” Qing Shui started to fantasize again as his blood began to surge. In this state it was a miracle that he somehow managed to find his way back to a familiar street. Eventually, Qing Shui finally arrived back the Qing Clan’s medical store. To think that he reaped so much benefits just going out for one day.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is already my 2nd time experiencing enlightenment. For the majority of people, they would achieve Xiantian during their first enlightenment, but as for me, despite this being my second time, Xiantian still feels far away and as intangible as a dream.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Forget it, some things can’t be forced, maybe I would get closer to it if I stopped actively seeking it. In this world of the nine continents, how many people want to break through to Xiantian? Yet, how many people actually achieved it? Some things can’t be forced indeed.”</span></p>

 <p><span style>The interior of the Night Fragrant Court was clad in warmth, akin to spring, while outside on the streets, one had to suffer the chill of winter. Luckily, what Qing Shui cultivated, was the tempering of his body. The chill had no way to invade his system. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He came here unintentionally, but left here with joy in his heart. It was just as comfortable as playing with a buxom lady. However, what would Qing Shui know of sex? What he knew was only through second-hand information such as films and novels from his previous world. His only physical intimate experience was with Yu He. However, earlier when he held Wu-Shuang’s hands, the feeling was not bad, actually capable of making his heartbeat quicken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doing it with Wu-Shuang, should be extremely comfortable right?” Qing Shui started to fantasize again as his blood began to surge. In this state it was a miracle that he somehow managed to find his way back to a familiar street. Eventually, Qing Shui finally arrived back the Qing Clan’s medical store. To think that he reaped so much benefits just going out for one day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is already my 2nd time experiencing enlightenment. For the majority of people, they would achieve Xiantian during their first enlightenment, but as for me, despite this being my second time, Xiantian still feels far away and as intangible as a dream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it, some things can’t be forced, maybe I would get closer to it if I stopped actively seeking it. In this world of the nine continents, how many people want to break through to Xiantian? Yet, how many people actually achieved it? Some things can’t be forced indeed.”</span></p>
