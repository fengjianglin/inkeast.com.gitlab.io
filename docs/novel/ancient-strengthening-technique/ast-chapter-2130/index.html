 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Fragrant Buddha Wood wasn't something that precious, it wasn't something that could be found easily either. There wasn't a lot of this and it didn't have many uses, other than being a type of fragrant wood. Zhang Yue had a piece of it. If they were to go look for one now, they might not be able to find one even if they were to take ten days or even half a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now had two Advancing Divine Worms. It was a great gain. Most importantly, there was that Hundred Treasure Chest as well. Although Qing Shui had taken Zhang Yue as his disciple, he would still provide him with compensation and won't let him lose out. Qing Shui planned on keeping the Hundred Treasure Chest. After all, it had been in Zhang Yue's hands for very long and it seemed that he didn't have an affinity with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unsure if it was thanks to the Fragrant Buddha Wood, but they caught another Advancing Divine Worm three days later. They caught it in a relatively secluded place and no one else had seen it. However, there was a rumor that two other groups had caught two other Advancing Divine Worms as well. The Demon Gate had caught one and the Five Tiger Immortal Sect had caught one as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the next three days, Qing Shui hadn't encountered any other people from the Demon Gate. Although Qing Shui was considered a member of the Divine Palace, to outsiders, the Divine Palace had now found three Advancing Divine Worms. However, regardless if it was the Divine Palace or the Demon Gate, they wouldn't force the other party to hand the worm over. They could use some other means of compensation provided that both parties were willing to take on the trade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course Qing Shui wouldn't hand the worms over. These Advancing Divine Worms were a treasure to the current Qing Shui, just like the Divine Square Cauldrons. Long Zhu`er was already very powerful now and if she were to become twice as strong, just the thought of it would make Qing Shui very excited. Long Zhu`er now had become Qing Shui's strongest demonic beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there weren't any accidents and Qing Shui had only caught three Advancing Divine Worms, he was considered to have gotten the greatest benefits from this. In order to prevent any accidents from happening, Qing Shui brought Nuo Lan and Zhang Yue back to the Imperial Cuisine Hall directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui killed the three Advancing Divine Worms and extracted their Origin Essence Pills. Upon arriving at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, he gave Nuo Lan one of them, "Here, this is for you. Don't mind that it's not a lot."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Forget it, there are only three. You should keep them for yourself." Nuo Lan gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's fine. It's already very good that I'm asking for two. I know you want it, so there's no need to hold back. When it's time to take action, you should just do it." Qing Shui pushed it to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan looked at the Origin Essence Pill in the porcelain bottle happily, "The benefits that I've received from following you around during this period of time is much more than what I've gotten over the recent few years."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, we're all tired. Go back and have a good rest then come down to have some food later." Qing Shui brought out some entry-level medicine books and items that can help to differentiate medicinal herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Zhang Yue, you'll stay in the Imperial Cuisine Hall for now. You must memorize all of these in a week's time." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Master, I'll do my best to accomplish this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal the moment he returned to his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Divine Square Cauldrons in Qing Shui's Treasure Basin was ready to be used since a long time ago. Therefore, the moment Qing Shui entered the realm, he could not wait and used them directly, upgrading the Divine Weapon Flying Sword. It went up by two grades directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier on, having just one Divine Square Cauldron had increased its grade by three and now, its grade increased by two despite there being two Divine Square Cauldrons. Qing Shui wasn't surprised. Earlier on, it should be that one Divine Square Cauldron was required for the increment in the first three grades. Now, at the fourth and fifth grade, two Divine Square Cauldrons should be required for each grade increment. Therefore, the Flying Sword's grade had increased by two. If two Divine Square Cauldrons was also required for the sixth grade, then the Flying Sword would have increased by three grades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was already very satisfied with the increment in two grades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Dipper Sword, Flying Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grade five!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Allowing members from the party to receive 10% less damage. The effect will sustain throughout the entire battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Increase 50% of self-recovery speed, all attacks, and defense by one billion Dao Force, reduce additional damages by one billion Dao Force, and reducing 5% of damage received.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw these effects, he smiled. He could sense an indescribable power filling him up. His Flying Sword Divine Weapon had also become stronger, which made Qing Shui feel that it was now sharper. The snow-white blade and the Big Dipper diagram on it made the Flying Sword appear more majestic and rustic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The upgraded Divine Weapon made Qing Shui's abilities stronger as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's attacking prowess, in addition to the enhancement from the Divine Weapon, now reached 2.5 billion Dao Force, and his defense reached 25 billion Dao Force under the effects. However, the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda could further fend off attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Weapon could reduce 15% of damages, increase the defense prowess by one billion Dao Force, and reduce additional damages by one billion Dao Force. Therefore, even if Qing Shui were to just stand there, neither moving nor applying any martial technique, he would have a defense of about 28.5 billion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Continents Mountain's attacking prowess had also increased by a little, reaching 12.5 billion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was when the Divine Weapon was only at grade 5. He wondered if he could get even stronger when the Divine Weapon's grade was to increase in the future. However, Qing Shui knew that it would be hard for his own attacking prowess to become his main force. However, he still had the Divine Weapon and the Dragon Slaying Beast to rely on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the thought of these, Qing Shui immediately brought out the Origin Essence Pills. He let Long Zhu`er took one. There was no dispute over this. He must let Long Zhu`er get stronger. As for the other one, Qing Shui hesitated on whether if he should give it to Little Rin, the Dragon Slaying Beast, or to the Dark Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, amongst these three demonic beasts, Dark Phoenix and Little Rin were about the same level while the Dragon Slaying Beast was of another category altogether. Under the situation where the target didn't move, the Dragon Slaying Beast would be a massacre machine. Otherwise, it would be very hard for its attack to hit. Heavens was fair. Therefore, Qing Shui felt that even if the Dragon Slaying Beast were to double its current strength, there wouldn't be much point to that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Qing Shui gave the Origin Essence Pill to Dark Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Zhu`er had entered a state like a giant cocoon that was getting increasingly bigger. The spider thread continued to increase in thickness and the powers on her continued to rise endlessly as well. Compared with Long Zhu`er, Dark Phoenix was covered in fierce flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what that astonished Qing Shui was that there was a layer of sky-blue frost on the surface of the burning flames. This frost seemed as if they existed for ten millions of years already. However, they showed no signs of melting at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day passed by, two days passed by...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had thought that it wouldn't take long, but seven days passed by in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui didn't do anything during these seven days as he observed the changes happening to these two demonic beasts.</span></p>
