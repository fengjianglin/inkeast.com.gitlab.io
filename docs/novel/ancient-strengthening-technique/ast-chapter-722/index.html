 <p><strong>AST 722 - Contact, Peak of the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique</strong></p>
 <p>Just at that moment, she suddenly felt as if she entered another dimension, when she went in, she was shocked.</p>
 <p>The dream among the sea of flowers!</p>
 <p>When Di Chen arrived here, she thought about the first time she met Qing Shui here. That rascal had touched her body here for the first time, she was touched all over, from her head to her toes.</p>
 <p>Immortal? Demon?</p>
 <p>She felt comforted by these thoughts, she felt that this world was very strange. She never have thought that her relationship with him would grow to this extent, she was now wondering where was he.</p>
 <p>He is here!</p>
 <p>Everywhere Di Chen looked, she just saw a sea of flowers. Why did she appear here? She was not sure, she raised her head to see Qing Shui silently standing there and she hurried over.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui…… “</p>
 <p>Di Chen gently called out, walking closer to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Actually, When Di Chen touched him, Qing Shui was already aware of it, he felt pain in his heart for this woman, he was afraid she would freeze too. Following that, he soon realized that they entered this dream among the sea of flowers. After coming her, although there was no more ice on his body, the cold poison in his blood was not weakened.</p>
 <p>“Chen`er, why are you here?” Qing Shui knew how dumb his question was, this was the dream among the sea of flowers, even he did not know why did they came here.</p>
 <p>“I do not know either, shortly after I touched you, I arrived here. Are you poisoned?” Di Chen did not speak much about that question.</p>
 <p>“Mn, don’t worry, I’m fine.” Qing Shui smiled but he could not conceal the cold Qi his body was emitting from Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“You are still lying to me?” Di Chen came forward and gently hugged Qing Shui tightly, She wanted to give warmth to Qing Shui. In that instant, it was bone chilling cold but in that instant, she found that she could slowly get used to it, even to the point of not feeling cold.</p>
 <p>“Silly girl……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sighed and wanted to push her away, but she had hugged him very tightly. Soon, he found out that she seemed fine, this was the dream among the sea of flowers, only their consciousness existed here, he could clearly feel everything, there was just their consciousness and feelings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that Di Chen’s body was very hot, hugging her might help to slowly resolve the cold poison in his blood. Only their clothes were in the way, if there were no clothes, then it might be better.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui thought about it, he surprising discovered that they were hugging each other naked. Qing Shui had verified that this was in his consciousness and it seemed that he had some degree of control over it. However, Di Chen felt shocked and shy, she even felt that she could no longer control her body.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, What is going on? Why are we……”</p>
 <p>“I do not know, I discovered that we do not seem to have control over this.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly at Di Chen. In the past, Qing Shui had no control over any of this, even the clothes they wore. Qing Shui knew that it had never been under his control, even if he did not have that thought earlier, their clothes would still disappear. It should be because the two of them were hugging, even the words they were speaking, just entered directly into the other person’s consciousness without having to speak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this should be an independent space of consciousness only accessible by him and Di Chen, the intermediary should be the Portrait of Beauty. All of this had already exceeded Qing Shui’s imagination, he did not know how to enter this dream among the sea of flowers. This had already happened twice and they were both involved each time.</p>
 <p>Di Chen did not dare to look at Qing Shui but when she looked down…… she quickly raised her head. She was blushing, making her look prettier. When she raised her head to look at Qing Shui, she noticed his eyes were no longer clear, causing her to feel ashamed and unable to show her face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged this body that seemed to be made by gods, her beauty was not only because of the extraordinary temperament but also her goddess-like figure. She had a long body that was as exquisite as jade, her slender muscles and skin that was smoother than satin, her long neck made her looked very refined. Although she was not curvy her gentle bumps made people feel that large breasts were overrated.</p>
 <p>She was very pure, even seemed holy, causing people to not bear to profane her body but Qing Shui still reacted to it. Just at this moment, the nameless Duo Cultivation Technique in his body circulated on its own again.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui’s nameless Duo Cultivation Technique circulated, he was surprised to find out that there was a technique circulating in Di Chen’s body as well. He thought the technique that Di Chen cultivated was a Duo Cultivation Technique as well.</p>
 <p>All of this was no long under their control, the two of them could only feel it. They could not even close their eyes and could only communicate via their consciousness. But under such a circumstance, Di Chen would never communicate with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>In the dream among the sea of flowers, the two of them kissed each other, not only Qing Shui And Di Chen could feel it, they could even view the scene from a third-person’s point of view……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered that it was the same with Qing Hanye, it was a spiritual communication, a Duo Cultivation of the consciousness. Now, the same thing was happening with Di Chen, the situation was almost the same.</p>
 <p>What caused Di Chen to be bashful was that she would take the initiative to touch Qing Shui, pandering to Qing Shui’s assaults.</p>
 <p>The Yin and Yang exchanged, when the two of them felt that feeling of intense ecstasy, the cold in Qing Shui’s blood started to vanish, the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique started to frantically circulate in his body.</p>
 <p>It circulated cycle after cycle……</p>
 <p>He broke through one cycle, then another cycle…...</p>
 <p>399 cycles!</p>
 <p>It stopped at this moment, Qing Shui had basically used up the postures in the drawing of the nameless technique. Although it was not under the control of his consciousness and his memories, it seemed to occurred naturally, allowing Qing Shui to feel this out of the world bliss once again.</p>
 <p>Although it was not under their control, Qing Shui figured that it would be difficult to see such an expression on Di Chen’s face again, unless they had this kind of spiritual connection again. Her expression was not was not bewitching nor was it extraordinary but it led Qing Shui to feel his body go soft.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>The dream among the sea of flowers twisted apart and the two of them exited. Right now, the two of them were on the Fire Bird. Their clothes were tidy and the ice was gone, just that the two of them was hugging each other tightly.</p>
 <p>Di Chen pushed Qing Shui aside as she blushed and tried to run away but the back of the Fire Bird was only so many meters wide. Furthermore, the space where they could stand was only four meters wide but tens of meters long.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly and walked toward Di Chen, who was about 10 meters away. He knew that she was shy, after all, such a thing had happened. Although, they did not really do it in real life. This was a spiritual exchange, it was even more real than reality and left a deeper impression…...</p>
 <p>In the dream among the sea of flowers, there was an actual exchange of Yin and Yang, it was in perfect harmony, it even caused Qing Shui’s abilities to improve again. Although he did not break through to the 7th cycle, he had achieved the peak of the 6th cycle. This speed caused Qing Shui to feeling very happy but now, he had to console Di Chen.</p>
 <p>He gently walked over to Di Chen’s side, from the back he could tell that her ears and neck were still red. He gently grabbed her waist.</p>
 <p>“Still shy?” Qing Shui smiled gently.</p>
 <p>Di Chen only lowered her head and did not say anything. When she thought of that shameful scene, she wanted to find a hole to hide in. Those shameful postures and her expressions and voices……</p>
 <p>“The heavens and earth are split into yin and yang, everything in the world has a yin and yang, humans as well. The heavens interact with the earth, the interaction of yin and yang is a very natural thing, it is the same for the matter between a male and female. Chen`er, are you not happy? These are the actual portrayals.” Qing Shui laughed after he said that.</p>
 <p>“Stop talking about it, you are not allowed to talk about it, you nasty thing.” Di Chen indignantly hugged Qing Shui, burying her head in his embrace and using her hands to stopper his mouth.</p>
 <p>Maybe because it was in the dream among the sea of flowers, even though it was her first time, there was no pain. From the start, they felt good, that intense ecstasy was not only felt by Qing Shui, the both of them felt it. Or else there would not be any harmony. Qing Shui knew that she knew about it but she was very embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I won’t say it, just don’t think about it. For the rest of this life, you are my woman, for the next life as well and the life after that, you are forever my woman.” Qing Shui slowly held her hand that was stoppering his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I, I’m not like that, what happened inside was not really……</p>
 <p>Di Chen did not even understand what was she trying to say but Qing Shui understood it. Actually, she was worried about how she had taken the initiative in the dream among the sea of flowers, she was afraid that Qing Shui would look down on her but she did not know what to say.</p>
 <p>“Chen`er, I understand what you are trying to say. In my heart, you are always that extraordinary fairy. Actually, I liked how you were able to ……”</p>
 <p>“You are still speaking about it!” Di Chen said in a huff.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be quiet, I’ll stop speaking already, don’t think too much, just know that I love you.” Qing Shui smiled and quickly said.</p>
 <p>The matter had passed, Qing Shui could not help but often think about the scene in the dream among the sea of flowers. When he thought of this, trouble came again because Di Chen could feel it, just like the first time. However, it was worst than the previous time, it caused her to find it difficult to endure it, she could feel every touch and her consciousness had no way of stopping it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly for he knew that he could not easily think about it. It wasn’t that she would feel it the moment he thought about it, only when he thought about it for a long time and focused on it. To others, it would seem like he was staring blankly, only when he focused on it, the feelings that were experienced in the dream among the sea of flowers would be experienced by Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Thus, it was not difficult to control it, or else, how could Qing Shui resist thinking about that first time.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked at Qing Shui bitterly, her extraordinary face had a shy look unique to her, “You are not allowed to think about it!”</p>
 <p>“I won’t think, only unless you allow me to.” Qing Shui said awkwardly, this moment felt even more awkward than the time in the dream among the sea of flowers, just like being caught peeping.</p>
 <p>After she was annoyed at Qing Shui, she did not say anything else, this had happened too suddenly. Every time she saw Qing Shui, she felt unnatural, it was easy for her to blush in front of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The sky just got dark, they then descended. This was was like the highlands, it was higher than other areas by at least 3000 meters.</p>
 <p>The soil here was dark red, the vegetation here seem especially sturdy. After they descended, Qing Shui checked out the surroundings, after he did not feel any danger, he pitched the tent.</p>
