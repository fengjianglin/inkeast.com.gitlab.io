 <p><strong>AST 1258 - Vitality Orchids, Hard To Meet Di Chen</strong></p>
 <p>This problem had continued to troubled them. They had always hoped to be awakened. Such a talent already appeared prior to the awakening, so if the awakening went through, the benefits they receive would definitely be something amazing.</p>
 <p>"Is that really possible?" Hu Yezhong looked at Qing Shui with great anticipation.</p>
 <p>"I'll be able to know after today, you must trust me. I can help you right now." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Of course I can trust you. If it's possible now, I want to try it immediately." Hu Yezhong said, not able to wait.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then we can start immediately. Sit down cross-legged, focusing on your Dantian. Don't think about anything else." Qing Shui smiled and took out a box of gold needles.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, stimulating the potential in one's body was an easy feat. It was nothing much.</p>
 <p>In about half an hour, he managed to accomplish something which appeared to be extremely hard. In order to bring about their awakening, they took quite a lot of medicinal pills which raise one's potential. However, it was a pity that the awakening didn’t occur even till now. But now, they could hardly believe that it managed to come so easily within such a short amount of time.</p>
 <p>"Today, I can only awaken about one-third. However, there's no need to worry. In the time to follow, the full awakening will be completed." Qing Shui smiled and kept the gold needles.</p>
 <p>Even without Qing Shui's words, Hu Yezhong could already sense it. In such a short amount of time, his abilities had increased by multiple folds. The area that increased more was his body's toughness. He felt as if he was like a metal wall. The aura he exuded could be felt by the people around him.</p>
 <p>"Amazing, this is too amazing." Hu Yezhong grabbed Qing Shui's hand and said agitatedly, not even able to speak well.</p>
 <p>"Third Brother, if you don't have anything else, can you please make way? It's my turn next." Hu Yimin was extremely agitated.</p>
 <p>Because she had a Shadow Body, she could raise her speed. To her, speed was more important than strength. Therefore, she was more agitated than anyone else now. Regardless if it was men or women, the pursuit of power was endless.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui was helping them, as well as helping himself. He wanted to slowly build up his influence in the the Western Oxhe Continent. The places in the Western Oxhe Continent didn't have a competitive relationship since most of them were barely able to handle their own territories. If there was competition, it would be for their reputation.</p>
 <p>These were also the things which the old men from the Heaven Secrets Academy had told him. Therefore, if there was someone from the Western Oxhe Continent who became Grade Five or higher, then it wouldn't be a bad thing for that person to reign over the entire Western Oxhe Continent. If no one was able to unite them, then it would be a cooperative relationship. Of course, there must also be competition but it wouldn't be to the point where they would eradicate one another. This was because no one would be able to bear that level of damage.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui performed the acupuncture on them, it was through their clothes. However, the clothes must be thin. When Hu Yimin’s potential was stimulated, a very powerful aura that was like a gush of wind flowed. The active aura changed Hu Yimin's disposition completely.</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Qing Shui."</p>
 <p>Hu Yimin gave Qing Shui a hug. Right now, everyone felt that this young man wasn't simple. Something which could make their clan helpless was solved by Qing Shui in slightly over an hour.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to stand on ceremony. Sister Min, both you and Third Brother should go and stabilize your powers. The effect should be very good." Qing Shui took out two bottles that contained Constitution Nurturing Pill and handed it to them.</p>
 <p>Since he decided to help them, he need to see it through the end. The Constitution Nurturing Pills weren't something which was especially precious either.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next day, after breakfast, Qing Shui followed Hu Yimin to head to the Diwu Clan. The Diwu Clan was also in the Imperial City, but was more inward compared to the Hu Clan. The further a clan was situated in, the more powerful their clan was.</p>
 <p>Right now, Hu Yimin was like a brand new person. However, Qing Shui felt that she was very good to him, just like how an elder sister would treat her younger brother. He could tell that it was a feeling that she sincerely felt from the bottom of her heart.</p>
 <p>"Right now, I believe that you'll be able to treat her." Hu Yiya said to Qing Shui excitedly. They were on Hu Yiya's Blue Hawk as they travelled at a relatively fast speed.</p>
 <p>"You have so much confidence in me?" Qing Shui asked politely. He was confident in himself as well, but one mustn't make it too absolute. It would be awkward if he ended up not being able to treat the person.</p>
 <p>"Yes, I have a lot of confidence in you. Now, no matter what you say, I'll feel that it's the truth."</p>
 <p>"Sister Min, that won't do. You'll get deceived very easily like this." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Are you looking down on me? My eyes are still very bright." Hu Yimin spoke confidently.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>As they chatted, they came to a relatively secluded place. The buildings here didn't seem like much, which was something which Qing Shui couldn't understand. By right, someone from the Diwu Clan shouldn't be staying in a place like this.</p>
 <p>As if she could tell what Qing Shui was thinking, Hu Yimin smiled and said, "My friend insists on staying here."</p>
 <p>By the time she said that, they had already came to the most quiet manor. There were many flowers around and the place was filled with the fragrance of orchids. There were more orchids than other plants in the courtyard, and there were a variety of colors.</p>
 <p>Two maids stood at the door, and they were both cultivators. What astonished Qing Shui was neither of the two ladies were weak. They could even be said to be very strong. However, thinking of how they were from the Diwu clan, it seemed perfectly normal.</p>
 <p>For Peak Grade Four State Masters to be a guard here... It was really a great investment.</p>
 <p>"Stop there!"</p>
 <p>The maid on the right coldly shouted out to stop Qing Shui and Hu Yimin.</p>
 <p>"I'm Hu Yimin. I came here before." Hu Yimin quickly said.</p>
 <p>"You can enter, but he can't." The maid continued to say.</p>
 <p>Hu Yimin didn't insist and said to Qing Shui with a smile: "Wait here for a moment, I'll come to get you later."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded and watched as Hu Yimin entered.</p>
 <p>After 15 minutes had passed, Hu Yimin finally walked out. She flashed the token in her hands and then waved toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly entered.</p>
 <p>The place wasn't very big. It was only about one Mu in size but there were many flowerbeds in the courtyard. There was a mysterious fragrance in the air.</p>
 <p>“Vitality Orchids！”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said as looked at some mysterious looking orchids in the courtyard with a strange expression.</p>
 <p>"What Vitality Orchids?"</p>
 <p>"To think that you can recognize the Vitality Orchids."</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui could say anything, a hoarse but pleasant sounding voice with a hint of coldness rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned and saw a lady with loosely-fitted clothes as she stood a distance away. Although the lady was very beautiful, she appeared very different from the Eldest Princess. However, this lady had a unique disposition that wouldn’t lose against the Eldest Princess. It made her attractiveness increased by many times.</p>
 <p>Such attractiveness gave one a sense of anticipation, or when one looked at her, they would want to see her each and every action and even want to hear her talk. It was an amazing charm.</p>
 <p>Her beautiful hair was tied up and she exuded a great feeling of poise and dignity. However, Qing Shui realized that the lady seemed to appear a little sickly.</p>
 <p>"The Vitality Orchid is a type of mysterious medicinal herb. Just one stalk of it has no effect. Neither does ten stalks. If it's still growing, only 99 stalks of them could exude a mysterious vitality that could prevent the depreciation of one's vitality to a certain degree." Qing Shui hadn't expected that they were also called the Vitality Orchids in this world. As for the effects, of course Qing Shui knew it well.</p>
 <p>The lady didn't show any changes. She took a few steps forward and Qing Shui could smell a faint orchid fragrance coming from her.</p>
 <p>"It's been very long since someone has come to look for me. My vitality has been depreciating and so has my abilities. Since you're on good terms with Min`er, go ahead. If it's not something too exaggerated, I'll help you if I can." The lady said softly.</p>
 <p>"I want to know where the Lotus Sect is at."</p>
 <p>"No!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't surprised by the straightforward reply as he merely continued: "I want to find someone from the Lotus Sect. Is there any way to do so?"</p>
 <p>"Find someone from Lotus Sect to help you bring a message."</p>
 <p>"Then can you help me bring a message?"</p>
 <p>"I'm no longer a member of the Lotus Sect."</p>
 <p>"Why? Is it because of Lotus Sect or is it because of you?"</p>
 <p>"I was the one who insisted on leaving. What's the point of someone in my state staying in the Lotus Sect?" The lady said calmly. Even her emotions were calm.</p>
 <p>It was only then did Qing Shui realized that this lady wasn't simple. It wasn't like what Hu Yimin had said, that her character changed a lot. In such a situation, it was not easy to be able to do this.</p>
 <p>It was because this was also to take life and death very lightly. Or rather, it could be said that in such a situation where she was left with no choice, she had resigned herself to fate. This was getting accustomed, it was different from not giving up on any bit of hope. This was a mentality that showed she was facing it calmly.</p>
 <p>"But I can't find anyone who can contact the people from the Lotus Sect now. Why don't we do this? If I can treat your condition, can you help me pass on a message?" Qing Shui asked seriously.</p>
 <p>Even though the lady was very cultured, she almost exploded. What was this? Putting aside the fact on whether he could treat her or not, even if he could, it was only so that she could help him pass on a message?</p>
 <p>Hu Yimin was also stunned, but she didn't say anything.</p>
 <p>"You're able to treat me?" The lady looked at him with a weird expression. She couldn't believe in Qing Shui at all.</p>
 <p>"I can't be absolutely sure. If I can't manage to treat you, you can help me. There's nothing for you to lose. What do you think?"</p>
 <p>The lady looked at Qing Shui for a very long time. "If it wasn't because Min`er brought you here and strongly recommended you, I would have definitely thrown you out."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't haggle over this but smiled and said, "Then Miss Diwu has agreed to my condition?"</p>
 <p>"I agree, of course I agree. Why would I not agree to such a good deal? The prerequisite is that you're able to heal me." The lady continued to say calmly.</p>
 <p>"Alright. Then I'll give you treatment now. Is it convenient?"</p>
 <p>"It is!"</p>
 <p>"Min`er, why don't you head back first? Don't worry, he'll be fine." The lady looked toward Hu Yimin and said.</p>
 <p>Hu Yimin looked at Qing Shui. The latter nodded and she left.</p>
 <p>"Go on, who are you looking for? I'll do my best to help you. We can forget about the treatment." The lady said and headed to the hall.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned, but he eventually understood. To say it blankly, she didn't believe that he could treat her. The reason she was doing all of these was for Hu Yimin.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed her into the hall. The room wasn't luxuriously decorated and appeared to be very simple and clean.</p>
 <p>"I want to look for Di Chen." Qing Shui eventually still said it. As for her treatment, he had already decided to do what he could for her.</p>
 <p>"Di Chen? You're looking for Di Chen? You're from the other five continents?" The lady looked at Qing Shui in great astonishment.</p>
 <p>"Mmm. Seems like you know her. This is great." Qing Shui said excitedly.</p>
 <p>"She's the Lotus Sect's Holy Maiden. I won't be able to help you on this." The lady sighed and said helplessly.</p>
