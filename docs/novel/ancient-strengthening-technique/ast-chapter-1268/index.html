 <p><strong>AST 1268 - Trust Is Very Important, Forget Bad Feelings</strong></p>
 <p>"Come lass, let me introduce you. This is my wife Di Chen. Di Chen, she's a daughter I've picked up. You can call her Qing Sha!" Qing Shui smiled and took Qing Sha's hand as he brought her toward Di Chen.</p>
 <p>"Father, what do you mean that you picked me up? Don't be saying it in such a bad way. Hello Madame!" Qing Sha mumbled toward Qing Shui before she smiled and said to Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha's smile was very rare. Unless one was on very good terms with Qing Shui, it would be very hard to see it.</p>
 <p>Di Chen took Qing Sha's hands and said with smile, "Hello, Sha`er. In the future, just treat me as one of you. If there's anything that you find inconvenient to tell him, just tell me. If it's something within my means, I'll definitely help you."</p>
 <p>"Madame is the best!" It was rare to see Qing Sha in such a good mood.</p>
 <p>"Madame is really beautiful. Father's expectations are really high." Qing Sha mumbled and said. However, everyone around could hear her.</p>
 <p>"Alright, let's all go in. It's considered a small reunion today. You guys just rest, I'll go cook." Qing Shui told all of them to go in.</p>
 <p>"Excellent, excellent. You must cook more today. It's been awhile since we've eaten your cooking."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very fast. Di Chen had initially wanted to help him but was rejected. He told her to chat with them. This little work was still considered to be quite easy for him.</p>
 <p>After a few polite exchanges and chatting, Qing Shui had enough to eat and he put down his bowl and chopsticks. The ladies had already finished eating. He asked, "How's the Heaven Secrets Academy doing recently?"</p>
 <p>"There doesn't seem to be any changes on the appearance, but inside, there's still some changes." The Eldest Princess smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Oh? What changes are there?" Qing Shui was very curious as well.</p>
 <p>"The Saint Child Band has lost a lot of influence while the Lord Sect appears to be still managed by Tian Jianxian. However on the outside, it's managed by Tian Jiange." the Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of how he had been surrounded by people when he left. Amongst those people, there were experts from these clans. They wanted to get rid of him, but didn't expected that they would be the ones to lose their lives instead. He wondered what reaction these clans would have once they knew that he was back.</p>
 <p>"How's the Breezing Wind Veranda?" Qing Shui looked at the Eldest Princess and asked.</p>
 <p>"The Breezing Wind Veranda is a lot stronger than before. Although there's only about over 3,000 people, they are comparatively people who are more outstanding and has potential. They are also dependable people." At the mention of the Breezing Wind Veranda, the Eldest Princess sounded quite satisfied.</p>
 <p>"Mmmm, not bad. Your cultivation has been improving at quite a fast rate as well. If Chen`er doesn't wish to stay at the Lotus Sect, what do you think about getting her to come and help you?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"You rascal, what are you trying to say? If Sister Chen wants to come, I'd rather give her the Breezing Wind Veranda." the Eldest Princess threw a complicated gaze at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Little rascal, there's nothing more for you to do here. If I really were to come here, I'll discuss it with Sunu." Di Chen took the Eldest Princess hand and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and took one of Di Chen's and the Eldest Princess' hands respectively. "Alright, alright, let's talk it over nicely. Family members must be more broad-minded toward each other."</p>
 <p>"Alright. Qing Shui, you must remember what I told you in the past. Let's talk about something else." The Eldest Princess resumed her casual tone and said.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Qing Shui realized that the relationship between himself and the Eldest Princess had returned to what it was like in the past. This made him feel very uncomfortable. Women's heart really changed really fast. Was she jealous? Or...</p>
 <p>Trust?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the Eldest Princess had misunderstood what he meant. She must be feeling that the reason he brought Di Chen over was because he didn't trust her. As he thought of this, he slapped his forehead. He was really an idiot. If he were in her shoes, he would probably feel the same.</p>
 <p>If a person from his previous life were to have two or more women, the person wouldn't dare to let the women meet each other. Although this wasn't the case in this world, it was impossible for the women to be get along entirely. In fact, till now, Qing Shui wasn't even sure if there were any barriers between his women.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, I don't have that intention."</p>
 <p>Qing Sha, Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess had left. Qing Shui took Di Chen's and the Eldest Princess hands and they sat down on the couch.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess now knew that Qing Shui didn't have that intention either. However, she didn't know why she felt so aggrieved previously and her heart just sunk. She also realized that unknowingly, Qing Shui's image in her heart had become so clear.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to apologize. I was the one who's narrow-minded." The Eldest Princess sighed and said.</p>
 <p>She didn't know why she sighed either, but it made Qing Shui felt a little bad for the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>"You aren't being narrow-minded. I only hope that you don't have such thinking. I'm not raising my guards against you. For your sake, I'd also be willing to fight with anyone, even if it's at the risk of my life. Although it's not worth dying for brute courage for the sake of women, I'm willing to do these for you guys. I don't wish to see you guys feeling aggrieved." Qing Shui said seriously while his hands clenched tightly around theirs.</p>
 <p>"Stop that. Why are you saying all those unlucky things." The Eldest Princess eventually let go off some of these emotions.</p>
 <p>Di Chen sat at the side and looked at Qing Shui, as she smiled, but she didn’t say any word. However, her heart was very, very close to Qing Shui. He was really a rascal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did feel a little embarrassed to be saying such things before the two of them. Thankfully, it wasn't as mushy as he thought it would be. They said that habits were very scary. In his previous life, he would never say something like this. This was also a show of confidence or a type of training.</p>
 <p>Many people knew that sweet nothings were just lies, but they were all willing to listen. Women were emotional creatures and men who were great with honeyed words would be able to get their hands on them completely.</p>
 <p>It wasn't that Qing Shui's earlier words were all lies. It was just that sometimes, it was still very important to say things out. After all, understanding each other would be limited by just relying on guess and observations. Therefore, words and actions were still necessary to express things.</p>
 <p>The two great beauties on each of his side had their respective merits. One of them exuded a celestial aura, as if she wasn't a part of the moral world, while the other had an amazing dignified aura.</p>
 <p>Not many people would be able to have a beauty in each of his arms.</p>
 <p>Everytime he was in such a situation, Qing Shui felt that it was unrealistic. Although there were many different types of people, to have one was already a result of accumulated great karma. The two ladies next to him were both beauties who were hard to come by even in a 100 years. In the past, he was still worried about not being able to find a partner. After all, when he was young, he was a good-for-nothing but there was a mature soul living in his body.</p>
 <p>If he had kept on being the good-for-nothing that he was, it would be very hard for him to find a partner in this world where people revered martial arts. After he was awakened to the ancient legacy, everything started to change. From an unknown good-for-nothing, from a small clan, everything had grown to what it was today. Looking back, it really feels a little unbelievable. It hadn't been easy either.</p>
 <p>It had been a battle over several decades in this world. If it was in his previous life, he would already have been a middle-aged man by now. Just the thought of it felt a little unrealistic.</p>
 <p>This was a way of thinking from Qing Shui's previous life. Moreover, he was the pillar in the Qing Clan and thus, would be more mature than the people of his age in this world. After all, in the current world, people at his age were still considered to be very young, even younger than those who were 20 years old in his previous life. Therefore, most people wouldn't think too much. This was a tradition and was also a habit.</p>
 <p>"Then you've forgiven me?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>"I'm of no relations to you at all. What does it matter if I forgive you or not?" The Eldest Princess smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook her hand and also blinked innocently as he looked at the Eldest Princess with a gaze that only she would understand. It didn't take long for the Eldest Princess to feel uneasy and lowered her head.</p>
 <p>"Chen`er knows about you too. And you can only be my woman in this life. It feels really bad to see you in the arms of another man." Qing Shui smiled and grabbed the hands of the ladies tightly.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, even if I don't go into your embrace, I won't go into another man's embrace. Are men's possessiveness all so strong?" The Eldest Princess asked.</p>
 <p>"This isn't a matter of possessiveness. This is as if someone is attacking me and is wanting to cut off my arm. Do you think I'll be willing to accept this?"</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess: "..."</p>
 <p>If she were to belong to another man, it would be as if his arm was cut off. Did he had to be that exaggerated. However, looking at his handsome and serious expression, she didn't say anything.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"The two of you can continue to chat. I'll make a trip to the Heaven Secrets Courtyard." Qing Shui said to Di Chen and the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>The two ladies nodded. It was nothing as they got along quite well. After all, neither Di Chen or the Eldest Princess were aware of how many women Qing Shui had, but they knew that the numbers wasn't small. Therefore, as they thought of this, the two ladies looked at each other feeling a little helpless.</p>
 <p>It wasn't that they hadn't thought of such a situation before, but they hadn't expected it to be like this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui entered the Heaven Secrets Courtyard directly. The old man in golden dragon robes and the old man in violet lion robes seemed to always be so free, as they drank tea and played chess. After they saw Qing Shui, they greeted him happily and got him to go over.</p>
 <p>The old men kept the chess set and poured tea for Qing Shui. They were still boiling tea on the table.</p>
 <p>"Sirs, let's boil some tea of mine and see how it tastes like, shall we?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out tea and water from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Although there was a lake in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, there was a small well in the middle of the realm. The water there was clearer, like that of spring water from the mountains. When he realized that, he had always drank water from there.</p>
 <p>This well had appeared when the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal upgraded. This should be the ‘lake's eye’. It must be the lake's eye of the pond which had been transformed into a lake.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui wasn't good at making tea, his advantage was that the things he used were all very good. Therefore, very soon, the two old men could sense the Spiritual Qi in the tea. When they drank it, they were full of praises.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really not a master at tea appreciation but he could at least tell if the tea was good or not.</p>
 <p>The two old men had long been masters in the art of tea. After all, they had been drinking tea for several hundreds of years. It would be hard for them to not become experts in this area.</p>
 <p>"That girl gives off the aura of one from the Lotus Sect." The golden dragon robed old man looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Yes, she's Lotus Sect's Holy Maiden and is also my wife. After the new year, I'll bring her to the Lotus Sect and have a talk with their sect lord. What ridiculous regulations they have. To think that they don't allow their disciples to get married. It's really cruel of them."</p>
 <p>"Haha, that crazy old woman would definitely fight it out with you." The golden dragon robed old man was stunned for a moment before he broke out laughing and said.</p>
 <p>"Oh, do you know the Lotus Sect's sect lord?"</p>
 <p>"Of course I do. That old woman has been cheated of her feelings when she was young, but that guy has also been torn into pieces. It's just that after that incident, the crazy old lady no longer trust men anymore."</p>
