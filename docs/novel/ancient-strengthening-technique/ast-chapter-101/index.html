  <p></p>
  <h1><span style>AST 0101 – A Quiet Beauty</span></h1>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t notice Yu He’s odd behavior. If he had not had s*x with Shi Qingzhuang then he would’ve continued flirting with Yu He and asking her to marry him. </span></p>
  <p><span style>However, right now, all of Qing Shui worries were placed on how to save Wenren Wu-Shuang, and the problem with Shi Qingzhuang. In his confusion, he had subconsciously abandoned Yu He. He genuinely congratulated Yu He to find someone else she loved soon. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t know Yu He had already changed quite a bit. She had feelings for Qing Shui at the very least, and felt possessive of him in her heart at the most. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was a simple person. The idea of monogamous marriages from the previous world had inscribed itself deeply into his spirit. Additionally, Shi Qingzhuang was his first woman; there were feelings that made him feel inseparable from her. It’s not like he hadn’t thought of having multiple wives, or owning a harem while possessing the power to control the world. He would think about lewd things like that every once in awhile. &nbsp;In fact, Qing Shui still doesn’t believe that a woman as mature as Yu He would like him, at least not right now. </span></p>
  <p><span style>He thought about Yu He, Shi Qingzhuang, and Wenren Wu-Shuang. &nbsp;He would be satisfied to be able to have any one of them. If he didn’t feel satisfied, then he wouldn’t be considered to be living in reality; instead he would be living in a nonsensical dream. &nbsp;Though he had a little connection with Shi Qingzhuang, he still had a long way to go before he could completely own her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If you don’t break it off when you need to, there will definite be consequences. He still hadn’t fulfilled the requirements to be half-hearted towards any one woman. This was a decision that took Qing Shui a long time to decide. </span></p>
  <p><span style>More than once, Qing Shui wanted to go to the Shi Clan to find Shi Qingzhuang. He even had ideas of asking for her hand in marriage at her doorstep, but Shi Qing Zhuang was the fiancee of Situ Bufan. This wasn’t the previous world. The views that the people of the nine continents had on this issue always made Qing Shui a little gloomy. If a woman was someone else’s fiancee or wife, having another man put their hands on them would be considered immoral.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could be immoral, but he didn’t have the chance. He was scared Shi Qingzhuang wouldn’t be able to handle the pressure, and that it would hurt her. Also, he wasn’t certain whether she actually had feelings for him or not.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was a way, but unfortunately, Qing Shui was unable to do that right now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>For example, if a Xiantian cultivator likes Shi Qingzhuang, he can honorably compete with Situ Bufan for Shi Qingzhuang. As long as Shi Qingzhuang selects this Xiantian, then Situ Bufan could only give up. The prerequisite for this is that the two of them can only be fiancees. If she’s his wife, then the woman’s name would be tarnished! </span></p>
  <p><span style>“If I could reach Xiantian, Shi Qingzhuang would definitely choose me. We would definitely be very happy together. “ Qing Shui thought while walking with a grin on his face. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ouch!” Qing Shui felt that he bumped into something. He suddenly heard someone’s painful cries and awoke from his fantasies. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hey, are you ok?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The one who was bumped to the ground was actually someone Qing Shui had met before. It was Ding Bao. That delicate little woman! Qing Shui, with a forced smile, reached out his hand to lift up Ding Bao, who was sitting on the floor. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“You, I saw you chuckling stupidly to yourself from afar. I was making sure that you could actually see the road, so I stood completely still. I didn’t think that you would still actually bump into me!” Ding Bao crinkled her delicate and small face, and rubbed her well rounded chest with one hand while rubbing her plump butt that she hurt with her other hand while sitting on the ground. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Her cute yet seductive actions made Qing Shui once again check out her ample and exquisite body. He had no choice but to approve that she was a beautiful little woman with assets. He realized that he bumped into her chests. No wonder it felt soft. They were relatively bouncy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I had thought it was me who was careless, but it was actually you, this little girl who purposely doesn’t move and hits yourself!” Qing Shui jokingly said while reaching his hand to rub Ding Bao’s head. After he put out his hand, he realized that it wasn’t appropriate, and shrunk back his hand in embarrassment.</span><span style>Qing Shui’s age from his past life and his current life added would be around early thirties, after taking out the four years without memories of his previous experiences. Therefore, Qing Shui’s mental age is around the same as Yu He’s. Although Qing Shui liked mature women, it was most likely due to his mental age. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Pfft, you are not even as old as me yet, and you call me a little girl? Qing Shi said that your age and his age were the same. However, you actually look like you’re in your twenties.” Ding Bao said while pouting her lips and giggling. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Okay, that’s enough. Why are you here? It wasn’t just to wait for me right?” Qing Shui jokingly said. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“In your dreams! Who would wait just for you. I was just curious. Watching you all dazed as though you just heard some overwhelming news. Let’s see if this sister can help you out. After all, we are acquaintances.” Ding Bao blinked with her crystal-like eyes. Her eyes seemed especially large on her small face. Very spiritual!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that he couldn’t argue against the wordplay that girls of her age often used. With a forced smile, he shook his head. “I still have things to do. I won’t chat with this little girl anymore. Let’s talk next time!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Seeing that Qing Shui wasn’t paying attention to her, she pouted her lips and stomped her feet a couple times. She was the proud lady of the Ding Clan, and was doted on and pampered throughout her entire life. She was good looking and cute. People of her age either were either fond of her, or were eagerly attentive of her. But they weren’t up to par with her expectations since they were only second class people. She never would have thought it possible for this youngster to dump her first. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Stupid Qing Shui. Stupid thing. See how I will make you pay me back for this in the future…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t know that someone was cursing him behind his back. He didn’t want to interact with a pampered girl from such a prominent family. Ding Bao had just told him that he wasn’t even as old as her yet, so qing Shui knew that it was not appropriate for him to interact too much with someone like her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t like pampered girls. In addition, he didn’t even like lolis. However, Qing Shui didn’t know that he had already been remembered by this high quality loli. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui somehow managed to walked into the Firecloud Blacksmith Store, and just in time. His cauldron for alchemy was completely destroyed, so he decided to buy another one, which was convenient for him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He stepped inside. Qing Shui noticed that there weren’t too many people, but that woman was inside. For a split second, Qing Shui felt sort of happy. </span></p>
  <p><span style>It’s as though she was telepathic. When Qing Shui’s eyes settled on the woman, she suddenly lifted her head and saw Qing Shui. Her clean smile made Qing Shui’s heart feel at peace. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“What a coincidence. We meet again!” The girl’s magnetic voice traveled to him. Qing Shui’s heart felt a bit numb, which was very comfortable. He melancholically sighed about the woman’s alluring quality.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ha ha. This isn’t a coincidence. I didn’t see you last time I came to the store!” Qing Shui said with a smile!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Really? What do you want today?” The woman smiled as she walked to Qing Shui’s side. Her beautiful eyes were filled with vigor, and glimmered while looking at Qing Shui! </span></p>
  <p><span style>She was a quiet woman. She had an elegant posture, and her expression made Qing Shui feel a bit dazzled and stunned. She was a pure yet flirty and stunning woman. </span></p>
