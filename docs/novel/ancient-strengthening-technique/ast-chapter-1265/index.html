 <p><strong>AST 1265 - Di Chen’s Change, Do You Still Want To Fight Now?</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui had heard of the rule about the Lotus Sect not allowing their disciples to get married before. Normally, before the disciples get married, they would have to leave the Lotus Sect. Furthermore, they were strictly prohibited to leak any informations regarding the Lotus Sect. If they did, they would be assassinated by the sect itself.</p>
 <p>The Holy Maiden of the Lotus Sect on the other hand, would need to dedicate her entire life for the sect itself. Unless she died, she would never be allowed to leave the Lotus Sect and getting married was beyond question. Even if the Holy Maiden was to take over the Lotus Sect, she would still be prohibited from doing so. There were still the Elder as well as the Supreme Elder Association to restrict her unless she could manage to shock the entire the Lotus Sect with her own strength.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked at Qing Shui and shook her head: “Qing Shui, there is no turning back for me. Listen to me, stop wasting your time on an insoluble problem. If you really have the strength to pull me out from the Lotus Sect, of course I will be happy. If not, the both of us will die.”</p>
 <p>“Foolish girl, who will dare to touch my woman? What’s wrong, do you not believe in what your husband is capable of?” Qing Shui said in a playful manner, not showing the slightest concern in anything she said. Actually, they had long since been considered husband and wife. Back then, both him and Di Chen was just one step away from becoming true husband and wife. In fact, they had already gone through Duo Cultivation in their mind before.</p>
 <p>“You’re still like this. You never put anyone in your eye. But I know that you don’t lie, it’s just that I really like the current the Lotus Sect……” Di Chen explained with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Who’s the sect lord of the current Lotus Sect? Let me go and negotiate with him. Rules are dead, but humans are alive.” After repeated thoughts and consideration, Qing Shui felt that this plan might just work. Besides, the sect lord of the current Lotus Sect wasn’t the same person who once established the rules for the Lotus Sect.</p>
 <p>The Blue Luan halted in mid-air, both Qing Shui and Di Chen stood on its back as he held both Di Chen’s hands. Then, he let go of her hand and proceeded to take off her veil. Di Chen didn’t try to stop him and Qing Shui on the other hand, looked at her with a shallow smile on his face.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui saw the familiar yet beautiful face, he softly touched her cheek and embraced her. That was all he did. Di Chen gently placed her hand around his neck.</p>
 <p>“Do you really want to meet our sect lord?” Di Chen’s breath smelled like an orchid. Because they were really close to each other, Qing Shui was able to smell the air which she breathed out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know when did she began to put on her veil. At the time when the Eldest Princess met her, it was very likely that she didn’t have her veil on or maybe, she could also be wearing it. After all, for women like Di Chen, one would find it almost unable to forget her face upon seeing her just once.</p>
 <p>“Of course, if she lets you get married and that you are also willing to stay in the Lotus Sect, things will be really simple. If not, I won’t mind starting a war with the Lotus Sect.” Qing Shui said casually.</p>
 <p>“The sect lord treats me really well. Unfortunately, she isn’t a man. I have told you this before. But regarding this matter, there is really nothing which you can talk about.” Di Chen let out a sigh.</p>
 <p>“You have told me before. Well then, did you plan back then to come back to the five continents or did you have a feeling that I will come look for you.” Qing Shui was really curious to know about this.</p>
 <p>“You will come. I knew that you will come to look for me. It’s just that I didn’t expect it to be this fast. Even if you didn’t come and find me, I will go back to look for you when I am capable of doing so. You belong to me for all eternity.” Di Chen smiled and said.</p>
 <p>When words like these came out of a woman of peerless elegance, it could cause quite a huge impact to Qing Shui. He unconsciously began to hug her tightly. “Don’t worry. Even if you feel like running away, you still won’t be able to. Bring me to see the sect lord of the Lotus Sect after new year.”</p>
 <p>“Are you certain you will succeed?” Di Chen smiled and lifted up her head to look at QIng Shui.</p>
 <p>“For you, I have to be.” Qing Shui smiled and responded.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, I’ll bring you to see the sect lord of the Lotus Sect after new year. If you guys don’t manage to reach a mutual agreement, I will leave the Lotus Sect with you.”</p>
 <p>“In the end, it’s still my woman that’s the best.” Qing Shui smiled happily.</p>
 <p>“Shameless fool, who is your woman.” Di Chen shot a glance at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, seems like you are starting to have some complaints. Let’s go, I’ll make you my woman right away.”Qing Shui said while he hugged her. At this moment, he felt really happy.</p>
 <p>“Your entire brain is filled up with these kinds of things. Tell me, how many women do you have now.” Di Chen playfully looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Err… This or that… You know that I’m not a random guy.” Qing Shui said a bit embarrassingly.</p>
 <p>Pu-chi!</p>
 <p>Di Chen smiled. “I was just asking to see what you’re nervous about. No matter how many women you have, I will still be your woman. But I won’t stay by your side. Whenever you miss me, you can come look for me.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at her. He knew that she was serious, hence, he said helplessly: “Don’t worry, other than not letting you leave me, for the remaining things, I will try my best to make you happy.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that even though Di Chen didn’t changed entirely, a slight part of her had. Maybe she would never be like other women and needed a kind of unique independent lifestyle which belonged to herself.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui intended to make her leave the Lotus Sect. But now, he realized that he might have to change his method to do so. For example, by changing the rules of the Lotus Sect.</p>
 <p>“I know, that’s why I let you bully me as you liked. Or else, how could I allow you to hug me like that?” Di Chen lightly spoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lowered his head. At the moment when he was about to kiss her tempting mouth, Di Chen desperately avoided it and let him kissed her cheek instead. “Qing Shui, I am still the Holy Maiden of the Lotus Sect. I need to be a virgin.” Di Chen said softly with her face blushed.</p>
 <p>“Then, when can you stop being a virgin?” Qing Shui didn’t do anything too excessive. Despite so, he still asked with a bit of hope and expectation.</p>
 <p>“Other than the Holy Maiden, the rest of the disciples do not necessarily have to be virgins. Even though the Lotus Sect has prohibited their disciples from getting married, they didn’t specifically said that the disciples within their sect had to be virgins.”</p>
 <p>“Then that means that the people from Lotus Sect can look for men, but they cannot get married?” Qing Shui asked in a weird tone.</p>
 <p>“It was explicitly said that they weren’t allowed to look for men.” Di Chen said.</p>
 <p>“Then that means they can secretly look for them.” Qing Shui had figured out the meaning behind those words.</p>
 <p>“More or less yes!”</p>
 <p>“Look at this, because of the Lotus Sect’s stubbornness, just what kind of thing has they choked their disciples into? They care about their face so much that it made people suffer even when they’re alive.” Qing Shui said angrily.</p>
 <p>“Go to hell, what nonsense are you saying!” Di Chen said angrily, yet she revealed a smile.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was reluctant to let go. Having a soft jade within his chest was already an enormous pleasure. Di Chen leaned against Qing Shui’s chest as she said something softly.</p>
 <p>“How are things back at home?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that she was talking about the five continents.</p>
 <p>“Everything has already been properly organized. On the next time the Ancient Great Teleportation Formation open, more people should be coming here.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“But to continue staying separated between two lands is by no means the best way to solve the problem.”</p>
 <p>“That’s why I want to get stronger. I want to see if I can fetch all of them here. Actually, once a person stayed at a place for a long time, they wouldn’t feel such strong desire to leave that place anymore.” Qing Shui said in a helpless tone.</p>
 <p>“When one misses a certain place, it's the people there whom they missed. If all of them were to come over, the place will no longer matter anymore.” Di Chen said softly.</p>
 <p>“Is it because I came that you began to feel that the Western Oxhe Continent looks really beautiful?”</p>
 <p>“Shameless, show off.” Di Chen smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, at the time when I received the letter which I left behind for you, I felt really happy. It has been so long since I last felt this happy.”</p>
 <p>“Back then, when I first received your letter, you had no idea how sad I was. At that time, I already felt like looking for you to spank your butt.” Qing Shui remembered the scene when he first received the letter. It was mostly because he was too worried about her.</p>
 <p>“Do you still feel like hitting me now?” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui gently.</p>
 <p>“Yes, but I feel reluctant to do so.”</p>
 <p>“Well then, hit me once.” At the moment when Di Chen said this, she blushed.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui knew that Di Chen was trying to let him take advantage of her. Hence, he too didn’t hold back. He immediately put both of his hands on top of her perky, well-rounded buttocks and grabbed them with all ten of his fingers. They were smooth like congealed fat and felt terrifyingly toned. Even though the weather was really cold now, formidable warriors still wore fairly thin shirts. To them, this kind of cold was nothing.</p>
 <p>Di Chen’s face looked a bit red as she buried her head into Qing Shui’s chest.</p>
 <p>Maybe because they hadn’t seen each other for a long time, Di Chen had thought through a lot of things. If not, Qing Shui reckoned that it would have been really hard to hear things like these from her mouth. Despite so, she still felt embarrassed to the point that she didn’t dare to lift up her head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hands constantly grabbed, rubbed, and circled around that part of her body. It was as if he was never able to get satisfied from playing with it. Di Chen’s body was soft like water.</p>
 <p>They were on the back of the Blue Luan and was currently really, really high up in the air. The Blue Luan had fluffy feather untainted by even a speck of dust.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know when, but he had begun to kiss Di Chen’s mouth. One of his hand felt unsatisfied and made its way up to her perky, jade-like breast.</p>
 <p>Di Chen’s body trembled and turned really stiff. However, she didn’t try to stop Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Di Chen laid side by side on top of the Blue Luan. Qing Shui greedily sucked the fluid within Di Chen’s mouth. Even her fragrant tongue was being sucked into his mouth while his other hand extended its way towards her cleavage.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don’t touch that part. Promise me, don’t just want me for now. In the future, I will still be yours.” Di Chen said while letting out a delicate pant.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t allow me to eat this part of yours, then you’ll have to let me eat another part of your body.” Qing Shui responded as he slowly removed her upper outer garment.</p>
 <p>Di Chen let Qing Shui did as he pleased as he removed her upper outer garment and her body-hugger. At the moment when the pair of plumped, snowy peak sprung out of her body, Qing Shui got stunned by its beauty. This was already more beautiful than art itself. It was a kind of stunning beauty.</p>
 <p>It was so white and smooth that not even the slightest flaw could be seen. It was so plump that Qing Shui found it difficult to grab all of it with merely one hand. The two pinky spots which stood erected on top of it emitted a fatal temptation. Di Chen squinted both of her eyes. She didn’t dare to look but she also refused to admit defeat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he grabbed one of her breast. As he looked at the one which he was grabbing onto, he felt even more agitated. While he looked at Di Chen, he slowly neared himself towards the other breast and gently sucked the pink and delicate spot on top of it. At that moment, the completely relaxed Qing Shui felt a slight chill across his bones. As he saw the beautiful face which was red like blood, he quickly kept his eyes tightly shut.</p>
 <p>Within the four hours, even though they didn’t really do anything for real, it was already almost close to it. Let alone prior to this, the Duo Cultivation which they carried out within their consciousness could already considered to be much more real.</p>
 <p>The two who still had their shirt worn tidily on their body snuggled up to each other. Di Chen’s face still looked red and Qing Shui on the other hand, was finally satisfied. Both of his hands were still playing with Di Chen’s plump breast like they were reluctant to stop.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what cultivation realm are you at now?” Di Chen laid down on her side on top of Qing Shui’s chest. She totally ignored his hand which was moving around her breasts.</p>
 <p>“I think my strength shouldn’t be too bad. In any case, people with 7,000 or 8,000 sun of strength can do nothing to me.” Qing Shui answered after he thought for awhile.</p>
 <p>“You are really a freak. Do you have any plans for the future?”</p>
 <p>“The reason why I rushed to the Western Oxhe Continent was precisely because I was worried about you. Now, everything has turned out well and I have also managed to find peace in my mind. But there is also one thing which mother told me about before I came here. It was about the man whom I called father. His tomb was empty and seems to be also around the four continents. However, I don’t know which continent it’s in. There is a huge possibility that he may still be alive. For mother’s sake, I am planning to look for him next.”</p>
