 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also really glad to see the three of them significantly raise their strength. The two girls in particular: their strength had actually multiplied by three times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then as he thought deeper into it, precious things showed up all the time across the continent. Everyday, there would be someone lucky who would find them. In a way, he could be considered to have been blessed greatly by the gods. Hence, it’s not out of the ordinary for the two girls to receive some boosts in their innate skills and their body physiques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that thought, he started to feel that it was just a very normal incident. It’s not that Qing Shui didn’t want the two girls to ever gain benefits. In fact, he wanted it more than anybody else. He was the one who would benefit the most if the strength of the two girls increased greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reward which they received this time had indeed been very grand. And coincidentally, it happened to be something which could be of use to them. If they were unlucky and the thing they found turned out to be useless to them, it wouldn’t be considered something which would benefit them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, Qing Shui couldn’t help but start wondering how perfect it would have been if he could obtain two additional Divine Water Beads. Certainly, it also wouldn’t be a problem if he managed to get his hands on more of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls had truly earned a huge prize on this trip. Qing Shui on the other hand, hadn’t managed to earn much from this trip. But before this, he had used his Extreme Yang Righteous Pill before. Qing Hanye was the opposite. She had the Extreme Yin Righteous Pill. Yiye Jiange was a Drakina Inheritor. If there was one more Divine Water Bead, it would definitely have been very useful to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go and look around for other stuff. There should still be more treasure rooms around.” Qing Shui took the lead and left the treasure room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Qing Shui had a feeling that the benefits he could potentially get from the Portrait of World Dominance was immeasurable. But even if he really didn’t manage to gain anything from this trip, he would still feel fine seeing the two girls get theirs. He wasn’t such a narrow-minded person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui spent quite a considerable amount of time walking around the formation. He kept on shuttling back and forth within the Nine Palace Portrait. At the moment when he discovered yet another treasure room, everyone’s eyes went bright once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This treasure room was the treasure room which they spotted at the beginning. It was the one with a sword hanging on its wall. Prior to this, though they spotted it, it wasn’t an easy task to go into the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This room resembled a study room. There was a small shelf in it. A few books could be seen on the shelf. Below the shelf were five brocade cases. Other than that, the only thing which remained was the sword on the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword was three feet long and about three inches thick. The body of the sword was surrounded by a sacred aura. Not even the slightest killing intention could be felt off it, yet no one dared to underestimate it. Anyone could tell that the sword was definitely not just an ordinary sword for decoration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Buddha Sword!” Muyun Qingge spoke all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also really surprised to find this. But then he remembered that he was in the ruins of Northern Ocean Divine Temple. But still, it was quite shocking to find a Buddha Sword, one of the most precious treasures of Buddhism, to be here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Buddha Sword was also known as the Sacred Sword. Only the purest, most sacred, righteous, dignified and extraordinary of all would be able to use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even among the Buddhists, very few people were actually able to draw out the full potential of Buddha Sword. It was no problem for a normal person to use it, certainly. However, the difference would be like comparing a decorative sword with a divine sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked forward and slowly took down the sword. He then proceeded to operate his energy and tested it, only for him to shake his head later on, “Who would like to give it a try?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng shook his head, “Though I may be a Holy Saint Inheritor, the requirement to use this sword is too high. I have also gotten a weapon which I am adapted to using.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought about Yiye Jiange. She should be able to use it. At the time when the Crystal Beast was acknowledging its owner, he could already tell that she was one of the purest people he had ever come across.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress immediately refused to try it. Muyun Qingge didn’t use swords. Hence, Qing Shui kept it with the intention of giving it to Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked forward and took out a book from the shelf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Water Origin Force. Once cultivated, could help boost water martial techniques by 10%. A passive battle technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui began looking through the book. The book itself was very thin with only a few pages. He only briefly looked through it before taking it away. Later on, he would make a few copies of the book so that everyone would be able to cultivate it. It was a passive battle technique and consumed zero energy, making it a decent moveset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress stowed the book away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The books in the study were mostly about water attributed martial techniques. They were all powerful battle techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw the last two books, he casually took out one of them and immediately got shocked from what he saw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Wood Proficiency!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not understanding what he just saw, Qing Shui casually begun flipping over the pages. His eyes turned bright as he saw the content. This was a Wood Attributed Martial Technique. But to be more precise, it was a martial technique which helped strengthen Wood Attributed abilities. As to how much exactly it helped strengthen, Qing Shui wasn’t sure about it himself. He had cultivated the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique and didn’t try to hide the book, showing it to all of them before tossing it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui took up the last book, he froze. The book had a very plain design. On it, there wasn’t even a single word. Nevertheless, the bleak and unadorned aura could clearly be felt being emitted from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, Qing Shui immediately used his Heavenly Vision Technique to examine the book. He was left with no choice but to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nameless Heaven Book, one of the most precious treasures in Buddhism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui who spotted these few words once again was surprised. He finally knew what it was. Before this, he thought that it was a martial technique. He never once thought for it to be a magic treasure. Luckily, he had the Heavenly Vision Technique. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have known how to deal with this thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could acknowledge an owner. Upon doing so, all techniques would be doubled in strength. At most, it could only increase all of the abilities by two times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It couldn’t be upgraded nor cultivated. It was a passive Magic Treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It acknowledged only a person with a Buddha Nature. It’s a treasure. Only people who were destined to have it would come across it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. This was indeed a great treasure. It was what he needed the most for the time being. This thing was precious for the 10% boost in strength it provided when the bearer possessed about 100 Sun of strength. By the time the user achieved ten thousand sun worth of strength, it would still boost their strength by 10%. The Divine Water Bead on the other hand, would only work once. Furthermore, it could only work on water attributed martial techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui didn’t reserve himself from getting it. This thing also required having buddha nature up to a certain extent. Hence, he immediately tossed it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He planned to let it recognize its owner later.</span></p>

Five beads, but the beads consisted of five elements. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, one for each element.</span></p>

Qing Shui took it up to have a look at them. They were the Five Elements beads. Each person could only take one of the beads. It didn’t matter how many kinds of the elements they cultivated, they could only take one of them. It carried almost the same effect as the Divine Water Beads, but the path it undertook was different. The abilities it helped increase was also different. But other than just the beads, there was also a five elements martial technique within each of the boxes for its corresponding elements.</span></p>

Wasn’t this just another form of the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique? Qing Shui took up one of the Wood Vines martial technique to have a look. The one here was more limited in terms of use, yet it felt even more precise. The path it took was almost just like the Basic Sword Technique. They showed the most basic stuff, yet they were also the fastest and the most useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could this be a Buddhist precious treasure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the outside, there were also the martial techniques like the Golden Sword and Wood Vines. However, they were not even one-tenth as precise as the things that’s shown here. Hence, Qing Shui was extremely happy. From the surface, the beads were stated to help increase the abilities of its respective elements. They were to support cultivation of their respective elements. Qing Shui was very upset, why were they left here? Why didn’t the Buddhists let the others cultivate it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Qing Shui to be even more confused. Eventually, he let them kept it. By then, they could cultivate it together. However, the two girls only took the Water Spiral which was water attributed. As for the other stuff, even the water attributed beads, they gave it to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also didn’t reject it. Now wasn’t the time to distribute useful things. The most important thing to do now was to look for more treasures.</span></p>
