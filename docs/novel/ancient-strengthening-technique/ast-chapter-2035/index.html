He could tell that the Yu Clan had great limitations and in the future, Yu Xixuan would be the one to reach the greatest heights. Other than Yu Xixuan, the other person should be her father. This calm and seemingly indifferent person would gain the greatest achievements in the Yu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that Yu Dinghe didn't have the intentions to fight for the clan head position. He was more like a wild and calm crane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Qiao looked toward Qing Shui as if he was looking at a God. He knew of his own injuries and had felt extremely dejected. He hadn't thought that he would be able to recover, but in that short period of time, he had gone down to hell and then felt as if he had risen up to heaven. To him, this was a great experience in his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This experience would even bring him a lot of benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister Qing, we've offended you earlier. Please forgive me. I'll drink this cup to show you my sincerity. Please feel free and at ease here." Yu Jianming picked up his wine cup and then down the wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't expected that Yu Jianming was such a flexible man either. However, after some thinking, he could understand. No matter how proud Yu Jianming was, it was very normal for Yu Jianming to bend when his father and his clan had done so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't make it hard on him. Many of the cultures here were applied in the same way. It was just like how in his previous life, drinking the wine had indicated that Yu Jianming had lowered his stand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're all young men, there's no need to stand on ceremony. You're Xixuan's elder brother and must be protective of your sister. I have a sister as well and she's treated like a princess back at home. Everyone in the family dotes on her and whoever dares to let her feel aggrieved would have to pay back 100 times more." Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Jianming blushed even more and nodded, "I know what to do. I was wrong earlier and had been bewitched."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Jianming had actually treated Yu Xixuan very well in the past, and it was true that Yu Xixuan was treated like a princess in the Yu Clan. It was ever since Yu Dingshan had become the clan's head that things had changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dingshan's expression was a little stiff. He could tell what Qing Shui was trying to say with his words and knew why these had happened. Therefore, he spoke up, "We actually didn't plan on letting Xixuan get married over. This is just a temporary measure.."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't plan on proving anything. He believed that they should know what his words meant and thus, didn't say any further. Qing Shui and Yu Xixuan needed time, and in the future, everything would be resolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the meal, Yu Dingshan let Yu Jianming brought Qing Shui to see a place. After Qing Shui had shared his requirements, Yu Dingshan immediately mentioned a place. Yu Xixuan also said that the place wasn't bad and they could head over to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the biggest road in the Azure Rainbow City and the Yu Clan had a number of manors along this road. The Yu Clan was a great clan in the Azure Rainbow City and was considered to be reputable. Therefore, they had quite a number of assets along the biggest road. This road was several hundred meters wide and over 10,000 li long. This was a scene which Qing Shui wouldn't be able to see in his previous life. Despite it being a flat and straight path, one couldn't see the end of the road. There were too many manors built on both sides of the road. It was very normal for the great clans in this city to have quite a number of assets and manors here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister Qing, this is the place. Take a look and see if you're satisfied with it." Yu Jianming brought Qing Shui and Yu Xixuan to a manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was one of the most prosperous places and Qing Shui could tell that this manor was very huge and was about the size of a larger school in his previous life. However, this place was more regulated, split into three big courtyards, with the building in the backyard being the largest. There were many building facilities and each building had three levels. However, each level was built to be very tall, with a height of over ten meters. It was unlike some buildings in Qing Shui's previous life, which were very short and one would feel suppressed to stay there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, not bad. I'm satisfied, satisfied." Qing Shui smiled and said. A place like this in his previous life would be comparable to a huge villa in the most prosperous location. The value was indescribable. Even in this world, the value of this manor was also tremendous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was brand new and very clean. They should have people cleaning up the place often.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Jianming handed Qing Shui the title deed to the place. These title deeds were sometimes effective and sometimes not. If an ordinary person were to stay here, this person might just disappear unknowingly and the place would soon become another person's residence. As long as one had power, no one would dare to create trouble regardless if the person had the deed or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Azure Rainbow City belonged to the Northern Blue Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was different from the other continents. The other continents also had countries, but this place had domains. A domain was a lot larger than a country, and the size of a domain could even be comparable to a smaller continent. This showed how big the Haohan Continent was, and how huge the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Azure Rainbow City was just a city in the Azure Rainbow City. He had no idea how many cities there were in the Northern Blue Domain. Even the Yu Clan had no idea either. This place was unlike Qing Shui's previous world, where they everything was advanced and they could count the cities, the population, etc. The civilization in this world was different and experts seldom would do such boring things. This world was too big and no one could be bothered to study things like these. In Qing Shui's previous life, it was normal to study how many people there were in a place, how many cities there were, the men to women ratio, and even the number of certain animals in a region. However, people in this world who would study things like that would be considered fools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Jianming left. Yu Xixuan smiled and looked at Qing Shui, saying, "Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, "Why thank me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You also saw it. I'm uncomfortable at home and that's why I left. The people at home are too cold-hearted." Yu Xixuan said, a little disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Your parents are very good toward you, but sometimes, this is how it is to be born in a great clan. At least, this is how it is for many people. You get to enjoy a good life, are superior in all aspects, and also strong. However, heaven is very fair. There'll always be one thing that doesn't go well for you. Otherwise, it'd be unfair." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That makes some sense. But are there nobody who has everything in their life, and all is going well for him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Humans will never feel satisfied. There's a saying from where I came from. Every family has its own troubles. There's no one who has everything. Furthermore, humans are beautiful because they are flawed. It's only with flaws that there are expectations. If a person stands at the very top, having everything they want, then the person will likely get sick of things very quickly. They could even get depressed, commit suicide, or no longer feeling any expectations in life and don't pursue anything. It'll feel as if you're the only person in this world and everyone else seemed to be like ants and wild beasts. You'll never feel a sense of belonging."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's too scary!" Yu Xixuan said in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Some people are actually very close to this. For example, those people who live an extravagant and wanton lifestyle such as the strongest experts in an area. They live their lives without the lack of money and women, being able to have sex with whoever they wished to, getting whatever they wanted. These people still have goals, therefore, they still have things to pursue in life. For example, to be the greatest expert in two places. By the way, do you like to live an extravagance life, giving in to pleasures?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You got sidetracked. You're the one who likes such a lifestyle." Yu Xixuan pouted, revealing her cute side. It was something which was hard to come by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, I like." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
