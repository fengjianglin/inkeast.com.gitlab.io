 <p><strong>AST 1151 - Tremendous Change, The Powerful Seven-Colored Pellet, Violet Golden Divine Force</strong></p>
 <p>He was now in a bad situation, yet he knew he couldn’t afford to start panicking, otherwise he would be finished for certain. He felt that everything he was experiencing now was the fault of the Violet Golden Blood Thread in his blood.</p>
 <p>In the span of a few moments, the Violet Golden Blood Thread had expanded a little, almost in a form of a line. The Violet Golden Blood Thread was liquid in nature, so it would always be in a form of a thread in any bloodline, which was why none of the Violet Golden Blood Thread was able to clash with the rest as it streamed along in his body.</p>
 <p>The blood thread inside his Dantian was becoming more violent by the second, causing Qing Shui to realize the gravity of the situation. His blood thread felt as if it was about explode. Moreover, he was losing quite a lot of blood as well.</p>
 <p>However, the Violet Gold Blood Thread was unaffected and continued to expand slowly. Qing Shui was relieved that it was the blood that contained water that was lost instead of the blood essence inside his body. His blood was being replenished slowly too. Unfortunately, the rate of blood loss was too quick for the blood to fully replenish at this rate.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body seemed to have lost all sorts of senses. The only thing working was his consciousness and the Yin Yang Image inside his mind.</p>
 <p>All this time, Qing Shui had no clue what the Yin Yang Image inside his sea of consciousness was about. However, it seemed brighter and clearer than before. There was still some ancient air surrounding the Yin Yang Image, which had grown a bit more intense as well.</p>
 <p>The Nine Yang Golden Body was now at its small success stage. If it was still at its previous state, Qing Shui wouldn’t know if his body could sustain the current changes. He was already stupefied as the current changes were too great for him to handle.</p>
 <p>The Yin Yang Image had never lit up like this before. A wave of divine force emanated from the image, which allowed Qing Shui to remain awake inside his consciousness. The Yin Yang Image was beginning to undergo a slight change as well.</p>
 <p>All of the energies seemed to have clashed with one another, unlike before when those energies travelled along his body in order and sequence. His inner organs had sustained severe damage. His pale gold bones, on the other hand, were still able to remain whole, albeit only for the moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could no longer control his own body. He tried to use his consciousness to control the blood thread because he had a feeling that the blood thread was the breaking point to the current changes. He had nothing to lose after all.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had never once thought that he would be in danger by consuming the Mysterious Fruit. Now that he thought of it, the previous times he consumed the fruit were too calm and peaceful.</p>
 <p>As he gained control over the blood thread, he forced the blood thread to reconnect to its original state from the beginning. He was almost there but he couldn’t make it reconnect in the end. He felt as if the power in his consciousness was lacking, so he decided to circulate the Yin Yang Image with all of his spiritual power.</p>
 <p>The Yin Yang Image circulated in a fast motion, which caused it to glow brighter too. The divine force that only Qing Shui could see began to activate on its own so that his body would not shut down completely.</p>
 <p>If he didn’t have the Yin Yang Image to heal and stabilize his body, he wouldn’t be able to endure the changes occurring in his body.</p>
 <p>Clack!</p>
 <p>At that moment when Qing Shui used his might to circulate his spiritual energy and activate the Yin Yang mage, an explosive sound rang out inside the sea of consciousness. In that instant, he felt that his spiritual energy had increased in capacity. The Yin Yang Image began to undergo a slight change too.</p>
 <p>The color of the image was more apparent than before. He couldn’t tell if the size of the image had changed but he could tell for certain that the image had become more substantial. The aura of the image had grown much denser than before as well.</p>
 <p>However, this wasn’t why Qing Shui was shocked in the first place. He was shocked because the small golden pearl in between the Niwan Palace and its surroundings inside the spiritual pool of the sea of consciousness had exploded, forming a field of a nebula in its place.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the explosion was the cause to the increase of his spiritual energy capacity. Before he could sense in detail the pearl explosion, another explosion occurred inside his Dantian, forcing him to check the Violet Golden Blood Thread immediately.</p>
 <p>As he had expected, the Violet Golden Blood Thread had formed into a circle or a ring, which were still circulating slowly. There was something inside him that he couldn’t describe in words - it was a form of change occurring to his power.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw his Dantian next, he froze. His mind short-circuited when he realized that the Dantian had changed tremendously. The Golden Pellet became more yellow-golden in color, meaning that it had become more substantial. He was more shocked that the Nature Energy Pellet and State of Immovable as Mountains Pellet had disappeared. The Emperor’s Qi Pellet had vanished too. However, he was able to discover that there was a Seven-Colored Pellet of the size of a walnut sitting in front of the Golden Pellet.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was shocked beyond words. However, he was more concerned than shocked because the effects from the Emperor’s Qi, Nature Energy, State of Immovable as Mountains were quite powerful. If they had truly vanished, he might as well die from the pain of his loss.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t care less about the pain anymore. Qing Shui quickly used his spiritual sense to tap into the Seven-Colored Pellet. The moment he did so, his brain received a huge blow and subsequently caused him to faint. He was too weak after all.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body dropped onto the pool of blood, still bleeding slowly, albeit in a small amount. The blood was slightly black too as it flowed out from his body.</p>
 <p>Just before Qing Shui fainted, there was another slight change that occurred in his body. The energy in his blood and bones continued to heal his body back to its optimal state. The Yin Yang Image was healing his body at the same time too.</p>
 <p>After half a day or so, Qing Shui gradually woke up. He sat upright when he regained his consciousness, disregarding the blood on his body. The pain he felt earlier was gone too. Even though he felt a bit uncomfortable, it was nothing that would affect him as much as earlier.</p>
 <p>Inner Sight!</p>
 <p>He quickly used the Inner Sight to observe his Dantian and discovered that the Golden Pellet and the smaller sized Seven-Colored Pellet were still there in his Dantian!</p>
 <p>The Golden Pellet shone brilliantly as it emitted a strong wave of energy toward the surroundings. Qing Shui was more excited because he could feel the power emanated much stronger than before, which he had not expected at all. In this case, he was able to sense that his physical strength had achieved about five nimbus of power.</p>
 <p>This change was the source of his delight because his physical power was doubled. However, he was now more concerned about the Seven-Colored Pellet and the power contained within it.</p>
 <p>He used his spiritual energy once more to sense it and what he received next was a strong rumble to his nerves. Qing Shui was nearly shocked to the point of fainting but he managed to regain his composure quickly. The powerful energy emanated from the Seven-Colored Pellet could sever the limbs of a human being quite easily and damage their inner organs. The strength of the pellet was far greater than his physical body strength. After that, a familiar energy travelled to his mind and entered his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>The Seven-Colored Pellet had actually combined the Emperor’s Qi Pellet, State of Immovable as Mountains Pellet and Nature Energy Pellet into one. Not only that, the Diamond Protection, Diamond Qi, Diamond Crossing Rivers, Frenzied Bull’s Strength….. All of them were combined together.</p>
 <p>Everything was combined into one form!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now more concerned about whether the Emperor’s Qi was still effective or not and whether the Shield Attack’s power remained as it was. He was also concerned about the existence of the paralyzing effect from the Heavenly Thunder Slash as it had never appeared before in all those times he had been using the skill…..</p>
 <p>When these familiar sensations managed to rush back to his mind, those energies had already converged into a one uniform energy.</p>
 <p>Violet Gold Divine Force!</p>
 <p>The domineering power of the Violet Gold Divine Force was quite impressive too. Qing Shui began to feel at ease after he took a closer look at the capability of the Violet Gold Divine Force.</p>
 <p>Violet Gold Divine Force: A passive ability that would increase the overall power of the body by seven times permanently. No energy consumption was needed to activate as the user would be free to use it whenever he pleased!</p>
 <p>The Violet Gold Divine Force was developed because of the Seven-Colored Pellet!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could only laugh when he knew the ability was passive and it would permanently increase his power. He didn’t expect that the converging of energy would bring forth a breakthrough to his power as well. He was mostly excited not only because his power was boosted but also his previous abilities were still intact.</p>
 <p>This Seven-Colored Pellet could be used as the Emperor’s Qi Pellet or as the substitute to his Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains…. Moreover, it could be used at the same time when these abilities were activated, allowing him to achieve a greater result than before.</p>
 <p>The current changes allowed the usage of these abilities to become his physical power without the need to activate them manually. As mentioned before, these abilities could be activated at any time, which would allow his strength to reach 40 nimbus of power permanently! On top of that, the divine energy inside his body would never be consumed in order to circulate the effect of the abilities throughout his body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had tried his abilities on himself several times and yet he still couldn’t believe that it was all true. After he had finally confirmed that the Seven-Coloured Pellet contained most of his previous abilities, he was able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>His power was increased by multiple times, yet he wasn’t sure if the Violet Gold Divine Force bequeathed by the Seven-Colored Pellet was a good thing or a bad thing. In any case, Qing Shui took a liking to this passive skill due to its zero energy consumption and the ability to be used at any time.</p>
 <p>This was similar to the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection he had from a long time ago. These skills had never disappointed him. And now because of these changes, he wasn’t sure if the future development of his skills would be affected or not.</p>
 <p>And then there was the Combination Sword Technique - a unique combination battle technique that could unleash an amazing capability. This technique required no Qi to be expended as it relied purely on detailed moves.</p>
 <p>These moves could only be executed during the Combination Sword Technique when he was equipped with a sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could only increase his powers by five times when he had tried to execute the Combination Sword Technique in the past. The current increase of power had changed to seven times and if he included the increment of power that he already had, that would make it to the increase of power by eight times. (Author’s note: For example, he had already attained five nimbus of power from before. If his power was increased by seven times, that would make it to 35 nimbus of power. In addition to the five nimbus of power, he would have a total of 40 nimbus of power altogether.)</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy, State of Immovable as Mountains, Shield Attack and Frenzied Bull’s Strength required a bit of comprehension to reach a breakthrough instead of basing on a some specialized cultivation. The morning Taichi Fists he had been doing were able to contribute to the Nature Energy and the State of Immovable as Mountains, which was why their breakthroughs would not be delayed or held off.</p>
 <p>The High Grade Focused Concentration was present as well. These abilities were still here but they were all mixed together. In a sense, one could say that he had retained his previous abilities and one could also say that he had lost them. One thing was for sure - Qing Shui still had these abilities inside him.</p>
 <p>Which was why in this case, Qing Shui was still happy about it. This time, he had received something truly worthwhile because his constitution had received a great boost.</p>
 <p>After that, he quickly sensed his own spiritual energy. He was elated to know that the power of his spiritual energy was the same as the power of his physical strength, which was the amount of five nimbus. Moreover, not only was the Violet Gold Divine Shield able to increase the power of the physical strength, it could do the same to his spiritual energy too.</p>
 <p>With the added effect from the Arhat Rosary Beads, Qing Shui’s overall spiritual energy could be boosted up to about 80 nimbus at any given time!</p>
 <p>As he entered his sea of consciousness, he could see a field of a nebula in front of him, where the source of boundless spiritual energy was emanating from. He understood from the beginning that it was the Yin-Yang Image that had changed the sea of consciousness tremendously. It started from the expansion of the spiritual energy and then to the streaming of the Violet Golden Blood Thread with the use of the spiritual energy into a big cycle, causing his Dantian to go through a tremendous change.</p>
 <p>The reason Qing Shui could attain his current power of five nimbus was probably because of the capability of this field of nebula. The reservoir of spiritual energy in his sea of consciousness was ten times bigger or more. However, this would not mean that the explosive force he could unleash would be the same. If a person was shown to be capable of moving a hundred jin of weight by himself, it would not mean that he would be able to move hundred jin of weight the distance of thousand meters successfully. Much of this would require endurance and the amount of spiritual energy one could contain in their body.</p>
 <p>The change that occurred to his sea of consciousness had cleared Qing Shui’s mind completely. This was one of the advantages of spiritual energy as his current attack could reach to the power of 600 nimbus, allowing the Nine Continents Mountain to unleash a power of 1,200 nimbus. His spiritual attack could even reach to about 960 nimbus, which was close to the thousand mark.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui currently was in possession of the Nine Continents Mountain and Nine Yang Golden Body, allowing his defense to grow stronger, which could ignore almost 70% of the spiritual damage received. Moreover, he would most likely be able to endure the spiritual damage received from an Early State Master, albeit barely!</p>
 <p>The 20% debuff by the Emperor’s Qi was not a small amount either. It would still be a terrifying feat if a State Master’s overall power was weakened by 20%!</p>
