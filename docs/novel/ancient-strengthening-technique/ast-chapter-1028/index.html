 <p><strong>AST 1028 - State of One with Elephant, Nirvanic Fruit, Di Qing's Appearance</strong></p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's State of One with Elephant could let him display an additional 30% of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's prowess. It was a pity that with the world's regulations, he could only have about 400 stars of strength, despite that, this was still very good as it was. Moreover, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was now very agile and had many battle techniques which could be complemented with Qing Shui's.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's Instantaneous Dragon Elephant Evasion and speed were very high right now. Most importantly, it had a powerful scale armor which covered almost his entire body. Moreover, with the State of One with Elephant, Qing Shui had not only gained about 400 stars in strength, but even the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had an increase in strength by 400 stars. It was because right now, he had become a single entity with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui used his Big Dipper Sword, with his doubled attacking prowess and the effect of Area Dominance, he could attack with a strength of 10,000 stars. Furthermore, when he used the State of One with Elephant, he could use the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's strength better.</p>
 <p>Four Phases Formation. Qing Shui felt that it was a bit too hard to use this now since the opponents they had encountered were a little too strong.</p>
 <p>When evening came, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He would improve every day, but at his level progress would be slow. After all, an increase in 1.5 stars was considered to be quite miserable for him. However, 1.5 stars was the strength of a Peak Martial Saint...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still prioritized the training of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. This was his foundation and he was now at the latter phase of the 7th Heavenly Layer. However, if he wished to attain a breakthrough to the 8th Heavenly Layer, it seemed that it would take quite a long time.</p>
 <p>The Golden Pellet in his Dantian no longer increased in size, but was getting sturdier and firmer. Qing Shui knew that this meant that he could still grow stronger.</p>
 <p>In the past, the Golden Pellet would get stronger bit by bit. It was when he was at the elementary phase of the 7th Heavenly Layer. When the Golden Pellet no longer grows any bigger, it would be at the intermediate phase and it would be considered to be in the later phase when it was completely firm and substantial, reaching the grand perfection stage for the 7th Heavenly Layer. It was then that he would have a chance to attain a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique tempered Qing Shui's body to have a physique of a Nine Yang Marionette King, Nine Yang Buddha Body, and Extreme Yang Body. Qing Shui didn’t know how the Extreme Yang Body was like, but it seemed to be very powerful.</p>
 <p>After he cultivated one round of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he would take a rest and walk around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was because he required a training for his mind as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had used up a lot of the 1,000 Year plum blossoms in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to brew the Plum Blossom Wine, which he had stock plenty of. This was also one of his interest in his free time, to brew wine!</p>
 <p>Tiger Bone Liquor, Plum Blossom Wine, and the Pearl Wine. The Pearl Wine was made from the dew on the plum blossoms and some other medicinal herbs. Wine like these, which were made from dew drops, were even more precious and it brought Qing Shui an unexpected surprise.</p>
 <p>It was just that the brewing process was very troublesome and the amount produced was very little. There were many varieties to Pearl Wine. In the past, Qing Shui thought that it could only be made using the dew from the pine branches which were 1,000 years or more. It seemed that he had thought too much into it.</p>
 <p>It was just that the amount of dew was too little and it was troublesome to gather them. Therefore, Qing Shui didn't have much Pearl Wine in stock right now. It was the one which he had the least amount and was quite precious.</p>
 <p>He had also accumulated a large amount of spices, fruits and stuff like that. So every time he cooks, as long as it was not salty and not inedible, it would definitely be a great delicacy with the help of these spices.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, after that flame-like grass had grown into a little tree, for all these years, it only produced a single fruit. The fruit was now the size of a fist and was green in color, with a glow around it.</p>
 <p>The tree which was only half the height of a person had a fruit which was the size of a fist, it looked very strange. A fiery red little tree looked like a blaze of fire from afar, yet there was a single ‘humongous’ glowing green-colored fruit on it.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui could see the description of this fruit, but it only had a name—Nirvanic Fruit. It had yet to mature.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very sensitive to the words Nirvana. He knew that this was something good. The Fire Bird, or rather, the ‘Black Bird’ would still come and take a look at this fruit. He could sense the Fire Bird's strong craving for it.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When he came out, the day was almost over. These days, the time at which Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal wasn't fixed, but it was usually either the early half or the later half of the night.</p>
 <p>After he left the realm, Qing Shui walked out. Most of the people from the Qing Clan had already gone to sleep. Of course, there were still some who were training. He stood by the window and looked at the night scenery outside. The window he was at was facing the most prosperous street and right now there were still many people along the streets, the night market had only just started.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, Di Qing has left her door unlocked for me."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a smile on his face. It was hard for her to say that she had left her door unlocked for him. He went out from the window and headed towards Di Qing's building. His speed was fast, like that of a ghost and within a few flashes he had appeared before her building. Even if someone was keeping a lookout, they wouldn't be able to see his figure at all.</p>
 <p>This building was very small and was suitable for two people. The first level was the hall which was about over 50 square meters, while the second level was the bedroom, washroom, and stuff.</p>
 <p>As expected, the door to the hall was only closed and not locked. Qing Shui pushed open the door and entered. The light stones had lit up the place brightly. These silvery-white glowing stones were especially beautiful, at least to him. He lifted his head and saw the lady on the stairs. She was dressed in a snow-white colored nightgown and under the snow-white light, she appeared to be like a fairy from the moon palace. The wispy aura which kept people at bay was still strong as before, but right now Qing Shui felt that it added a hint of charm.</p>
 <p>She had a beautiful figure. Both Di Chen and Di Qing didn’t have those exaggerated curves, but their bodies were still the most beautiful, soft and exquisite, as if they were the work of the heavens. Her nightgown draped down below her knees and her snow-white lower thighs were straight and well-developed, which exuded a jade-like glow. Her bare feet were snow-white and exquisite. Qing Shui didn't have a fetish for feet, but at this moment he had the strong urge to hold them and kiss them thoroughly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and closed the door to the hall. Suddenly, he felt that his heartbeat had become fast, which made him felt surprised. He gradually walked toward the stairs and went up right before Di Qing, he stood two steps lower than her.</p>
 <p>It was when he got closer that did Qing Shui realized that Di Qing's heartbeat was very fast. She was trying to force herself to remain calm. He took up her hand and said, "Beautiful!"</p>
 <p>When she heard Qing Shui's words, an intoxicating smile appeared on Di Qing's face. She grabbed his hand tightly and led him upstairs. She liked the anxious feeling that she felt right now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui enjoyed the heartthrob he was experiencing now. Looking at the lady holding his hand who was like a fairy, he had a strong sense of satisfaction. Humans were easily moved by food and emotions. These two things held the greatest amount of importance in a person's life.</p>
 <p>Di Qing led Qing Shui hand by hand, as they went into the middle room and closed the door. This was a very small door and Qing Shui took off his shoes at the entrance. There was a snow-white rug.</p>
 <p>There was a faint feminine fragrance in the room and the after fragrance of a bath coming from Di Qing. From the moment he saw Di Qing up to this point, she hadn't said a single word and Qing Shui only spoke that one word on the stairs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took Di Qing's hand, sat by the bed and said with a smile, "Qing`er, let me tell you a joke."</p>
 <p>"Oh? What joke?" Di Qing didn't know why Qing Shui was bringing up a joke at this moment, but she still asked softly.</p>
 <p>"A turtle got hurt and got the snail to call for a physician. After two hours, the snail still hadn't returned. The turtle felt anxious and scolded, 'Damn it, if he still doesn't come back, I'm dead meat!' Just then, the snail's voice rang out from outside the door, 'Damn you, if you go on, I'm not going to go anymore!'"</p>
 <p>"Pffft!"</p>
 <p>Di Qing laughed out and the atmosphere wasn't as tense as before. Qing Shui wanted to do enjoyable things in a lighthearted atmosphere.</p>
 <p>"Let me tell you one more. It's still about a turtle." Qing Shui wrapped one of his hands around her slender waist and smiled, and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright!" Di Qing leaned against Qing Shui and smiled. She felt very blissful and relaxed right now.</p>
 <p>"Two turtles in heat went to have a date at the seaside. However, only the male turtle returned. Everyone asked why he came back alone? Where was the female turtle? The male turtle said, [We wanted to be more civilized today and do it in a pose like humans do. Therefore, she let me do her while she was lying back... Oh! It felt good! It was really a whole different feeling... If She hasn't returned, it means she hasn't managed to flip back over!]"</p>
 <p>"Pffft, you rascal." Di Qing smiled. She gave Qing Shui a light pound and chided her, her red blush making her appearance extremely seductive.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at that intoxicating beauty and flipped over, pressing her down against the soft bed as he teased, "Qing`er, we're humans. Shall we try some other poses? You know, we caught that Triple-eyed Grass Green Frog. How about that pose?"</p>
 <p>"Ahhh, you rascal! I forbid you to say things like that!" Di Qing turned flush red, as she looked at the man who was on top of her. Back then, the two mating Triple-eyed Grass Green Frogs they caught had scared her off in shame.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged her and turned so that both of them were lying next to each other, in each other's arms as their noses touched together. Their faces were less than an inch away from one another and he could feel the fragrant breath when Di Qing exhaled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui reached his head forward and nibbled on those tender lips, sucking that pair of beautiful lips which was sweet like flowers. Her tender lips were softly bitten and tugged on.</p>
 <p>Di Qing's nose twitched slightly, as she let out a soft breathing sound. She was having butterflies in her stomach and had a feeling which she couldn't begin to describe. Her arms unknowingly tightened themselves around Qing Shui's neck.</p>
 <p>"Little Qingqing, reach out your tongue." Qing Shui let go of her beautiful lips and said softly.</p>
 <p>"I don't want..."</p>
 <p>"You really don't want to?" Qing Shui teased.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Di Qing had opened her beautiful misty eyes and looked at Qing Shui anxiously. The pink blush on her cheeks tugged at Qing Shui's heart.</p>
 <p>"Really don't want to..."</p>
 <p>"Then I'll take off your clothes and suck you here." Qing Shui blinked and one of his hands grabbed her peaks.</p>
 <p>Even if Di Qing knew what was going to happen today, she still felt anxious when Qing Shui said it out loud. Just as Qing Shui had reached out his hands to undo her clothes, she closed her eyes and stuck out her tender little tongue.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui chuckled and gently sucked on a small portion of that beautiful tongue, sensing the woman's slight tremble.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, Qing Shui's hand had undone Di Qing's clothes.</p>
 <p>Di Qing knew, but in the process she had nervously grabbed Qing Shui's hand twice. This was a subconscious move, and when Di Qing's perfect body was displayed before Qing Shui, he was still stunned by how amazing the Creator was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's hand slowly explored her body, inch by inch...</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The two of them entangled together all the way until daybreak before they calmed down. Di Qing curled up in Qing Shui's arms, her tired face was also filled with extreme satisfaction. They both had a high level of cultivation and although this was Di Qing's first time, the pain she felt was nothing. Moreover, Qing Shui had also given her a massage in the process...</p>
