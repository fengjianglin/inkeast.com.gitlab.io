 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 257 Relentless Entanglement, All Good Things Will Come To An End</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui would never have thought that the bangle increased destructive powers. To think that this seemingly inconspicuous bangle would increase one’s destructive powers by 10%.</p>
  <p>He was able to increase the damage dealt on an opponent by 10%. In times of need, this additional 10% could be sufficient enough to send him to his death.</p>
  <p>This was the prowess of destructive powers. While it may seem insignificant at times, these destructive powers would be the last straw to squash a camel to its death in the end.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui picked up the bangle and put it on. Immediately, he felt a violent and destructive force of energy rising in his body. It was a feeling that would bring about additional destructive damage during an attack.</p>
  <p>What made Qing Shui happy was that just by having one, he could activate its effects since it would save him half the time. Initially, Qing Shui had thought that he would be able to put on an unlimited number of these accessories. It would be even better if he could put on more than ten of them on each arm. However, he knew that the possibility of this would not be very high.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui then continued to forge another, and cultivated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to its maximum. After, he continued to forge armors and bangles, not stopping even for a short while. When he had completed forging two boots, one set of battle armor, three sets of battle skirts, and five bangles, it was about time for him to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>When he was forging the battle skirts, Qing Shui was still slightly astonished in the process. While these battle skirts must be shorter than the knees, there was still a need to forge knee and leg guards inside. To be blunt, it was just like adding a mini skirt at the waist.</p>
  <p>While there was an additional skirt, it was like adding the finishing touch. This allowed the whole set of battle skirts to maintain a lady’s valiance while adding on a touch of gentleness.</p>
  <p>Its properties were the same as the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor. It was the first time ever that Qing Shui had felt so exhausted. That was why after he left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he immediately fell into a deep sleep.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui woke up in the morning, he thought of what happened the day before and immediately took the items he forged and headed out. The battle armor and battle skirt gleamed under the morning sun, causing one to feel happy from just looking at it.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui still considered if he should call the two ladies along when he recalled the wonderful scene when they parted last night. The corners of his lips curled up as it gave him nostalgia.</p>
  <p>Thereafter, Qing Shui smiled and looked towards the two ladies who had come down from the nearby building. It was said that beauties looked wonderful in the morning. A lady’s most beautiful moment was when she woke up in bed. That state of laziness was even more beautiful. However, it was a pity that not many people could get to see it. Currently, there should not be any men who were able to see Canghai Mingyue’s and Huoyun Liu-Li’s lazy state when they were still in bed.</p>
  <p>Seeing Qing Shui carrying thick stacks of armors and other stuff, the two ladies walked over curiously. It might be because they could not help but feel a little bit uneasy when they recalled the scene last night, especially for Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, what is this?”</p>
  <p>“It’s great that both of you are here. Take one each and leave the rest for Senior.” Qing Shui smiled and said to the two ladies.</p>
  <p>“For us?”</p>
  <p>“If not, then for who? Quick, each of you take one first and then the other two. These two pairs of boots would be for Senior.” Qing Shui urged again.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue opened her mouth but did not say anything as she received it from Qing Shui’s hands. Huoyun Liu-Li also quickly took one. Qing Shui was very happy. He knew Canghai Mingyue might have wanted to ask him when they were forged even though she did not say anything.</p>
  <p>“Can I try it on now?” Huoyun Liu-Li blinked her beautiful eyes and said as she recalled the effects of those boots.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded!</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li left with her set of battle skirt and headed into the building!</p>
  <p>“Are you going to try it out as well as to see how it is?” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue who was beside him. He felt that she would definitely be so beautiful that it would be overwhelming if she were to put it on.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue gave a weird glance towards Qing Shui. Qing Shui silently rubbed his nose and saw the bangle on his hand. He immediately took one out and handed it to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“This is for you. Everyone will have one.”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue did not take it but looked at that black bangle. It was so beautiful that it looked mysterious. Canghai Mingyue did not receive it but extended her snow white hand.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s mind became short-circuited. Out of reflex, he put it onto that snow white wrist and looked dazedly at that divinely beautiful face of hers.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue moved away from Qing Shui’s blazing gaze. At that moment, Huoyun Liu-Li came out in a suit consisting of a golden battle skirt and her long green boots. Although Qing Shui had some mental preparation, he was still stunned by her amazing beauty.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li who was very sexy to begin with, appeared ever so dignified in the golden battle skirt. However, her charming eyes were still gleaming, especially when she was looking at Qing Shui. She caused him to feel a tingling feeling as if he was sapped of all his strength.</p>
  <p>“Demoness!” Qing Shui still felt that this word best described her. Between her steps, she gave off a feeling as if she had flames which would cause others to drown in wild imagination.</p>
  <p>“Do I look good?” Huoyun Liu-Li sashayed over to Qing Shui and made a swirl around on the spot. Her long black hair that covered her shoulders was able to complement her feminine charms.</p>
  <p>“Yes!” Saying this, Qing Shui took out another bangle. When he saw Huoyun Liu-Li acting slightly spoiled as she reached out her slender hand, Qing Shui looked towards Canghai Mingyue, embarrassed.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue, on the other hand, smiled as if she had not seen a thing!</p>
  <p>“How can you put it on for Sister Mingyue but can’t be bothered with me?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s blaming tone made Qing Shui stunned. Canghai Mingyue looked towards Huoyun Liu-Li in surprise, however, her pretty face was dyed red with a blush.</p>
  <p>“Why would I… it couldn’t be more welcomed… ” Qing Shui quickly put it on for Huoyun Liu-Li, as he was brooding over how Huoyun Liu-Li would chance upon the scene where he put on the bangle for Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“For these few days, don’t leave this please if there’s nothing important. Pass those to Senior. I hope that they’ll be of some use.” Qing Shui handed over the remaining things in his hands to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>Having gotten used to it, Huoyun Liu-Li was very surprised when she first put on the boots Qing Shui first forged. She did not ask anything even though she was still surprised. She only felt very happy to know that everything was made by Qing Shui, as if it was very normal.</p>
  <p>“Yueyue, after you’ve put them on, remember to let me take a look!” Qing Shui called out towards the two ladies who had not gone far.</p>
  <p>What he got in return were Huoyun Liu-Li’s gigglings and Canghai Mingyue’s blaming glance!</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui saw Canghai Mingyue, he knew that the past events changed her, or made her put down her arrogance!</p>
  <p>During breakfast, the Canghai couple looked at Qing Shui, brimming with smiles. Even Canghai Mingyue was slightly embarrassed when she saw their gazes.</p>
  <p>“Thank you Qing Shui. With these items of yours, I’ll be able to fend off more than ten additional moves!” Canghai smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Senior, you’re being too modest. This time around, it’ll be a fight with our lives on the line.” Qing Shui grinned and said, appearing very honest. The two ladies who were looking at this scene could not even believe it, especially for Canghai Mingyue. There were several occasions when Qing Shui smiled very lewdly at her. However, seeing how honest he was smiling now, she had found it strangely unbelievable.</p>
  <p>“Alright, but if there are any changes to the situation, you all must listen to my arrangement.” Canghai looked towards Qing Shui, saying very seriously.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui let out a sigh and nodded. He knew that Canghai’s arrangements would be for him to take Canghai Mingyue and run… </p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue’s gaze were slightly dim, but she did not speak a word. However, her stubborn gaze had told the others of her decision. Canghai smiled. When the time comes, he would naturally have a way to let Qing Shui take her away.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui went to the blacksmith store in the morning and saw that Hu You was around. When Hu You saw him, he walked over happily!</p>
  <p>“I mastered the Qi Movement, I mastered the Qi Movement!” Hu You said the same line twice.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and said, “Today, you can learn this set of hammering technique.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not close the door to the blacksmith shop. He was afraid that the dignified middle-aged man dress in purple would come again. The human traffic in the streets and in the store could still be able to hold some reservations.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui shared the main points of the Thousand Hammer Technique. He taught him how to exert his strength, and did a slow demonstration before he looked at Hu You’s attempt at forging from the side.</p>
  <p>The current Hu You had long recovered from his ailment after receiving treatment from Qing Shui. His muscular build had even more strength than before.</p>
  <p>Until half the day was gone, Qing Shui felt that Hu You could already use the Thousand Hammer Technique, but without fluency. He had initially planned on giving him two more Strength-Enhancing Fruits, but it was a pity that he had nothing left other than an Agility-Enhancing Fruit kept aside for emergency purposes. This fruit was kept aside as a means for Qing Shui to save himself and create an escape route. That was why he had been holding onto one all this while, just for that spike in agility for fifteen minutes.</p>
  <p>After falling into a daze for a while, Qing Shui looked at Hu You and said, “Brother Hu, I won’t have any use for this blacksmith store anymore. I may never come back here again. You must practice this hammering technique as well as that Qi Movement.”</p>
  <p>“Why are you leaving?” Hu You asked, feeling a bit surprise and sad.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui nodded, “All good things will come to an end someday. I’m very happy to have met Brother Hu. If fate allows, we will meet again. I’m here to bid my goodbye to Brother Hu.”</p>
  <p>Hu You furrowed his brows and let out a sigh after a while. “Brother, you are meant to do great things. If you were to pass by here one day, you must come and visit your elder brother. If there are no accidents, I will likely not leave this place.”</p>
  <p>After saying this, Hu You cheered up. He was thankful towards this handsome young man and knew that it was impossible for him to stay in this blacksmith store forever.</p>
  <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll come back to visit you in the future. Take care!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui took his leave, not feeling that gloomy. Although Hu You looked like his eldest brother, he was not him. Qing Shui also wanted to give him a peace of mind. Since they were going to part, they might as well be more straightforward about it.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui left. He had initially wanted to instruct Hu You not to leave Southern City within half a year, but when he heard that he had no plans to leave, he was relieved. After all, Qing Shui was worried that those people he had come into contact with would fall prey to the Immortal Sword Sect. If they did not leave, they would generally be safe.</p>
  <p>Only when Qing Shui returned to Canghai’s residence did he feel assured. Unknowingly, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li had entered his heart, and he could not bear to cut them off.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could not help but recall the reason behind this adventure. Initially, he had planned to come to Greencloud Continent to gain experience and train himself. He had not expected that Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li would come together with him. As time passed by, feelings grew. Regardless of what kind of feelings they were, Qing Shui did not have many friends, but treated Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li as his companions.</p>
  <p>It was to the extent that sometimes, Qing Shui would feel that their relationship was not as simple as just friends, but not that of love. Qing Shui did not expect this, but it was a complicated and entangled relationship.</p>
  <p>When he went back and saw that Canghai Mingyue was standing by the pond again and in a daze, Qing Shui knew that she was feeling worried again about leaving it to his arrangements.</p>
  <p>“Yueyue, don’t worry. Come, let Elder Brother give you a hug…”</p>

 <p>Canghai Mingyue opened her mouth but did not say anything as she received it from Qing Shui’s hands. Huoyun Liu-Li also quickly took one. Qing Shui was very happy. He knew Canghai Mingyue might have wanted to ask him when they were forged even though she did not say anything.</p>
 <p>“Can I try it on now?” Huoyun Liu-Li blinked her beautiful eyes and said as she recalled the effects of those boots.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded!</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li left with her set of battle skirt and headed into the building!</p>
 <p>“Are you going to try it out as well as to see how it is?” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue who was beside him. He felt that she would definitely be so beautiful that it would be overwhelming if she were to put it on.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue gave a weird glance towards Qing Shui. Qing Shui silently rubbed his nose and saw the bangle on his hand. He immediately took one out and handed it to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“This is for you. Everyone will have one.”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue did not take it but looked at that black bangle. It was so beautiful that it looked mysterious. Canghai Mingyue did not receive it but extended her snow white hand.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s mind became short-circuited. Out of reflex, he put it onto that snow white wrist and looked dazedly at that divinely beautiful face of hers.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue moved away from Qing Shui’s blazing gaze. At that moment, Huoyun Liu-Li came out in a suit consisting of a golden battle skirt and her long green boots. Although Qing Shui had some mental preparation, he was still stunned by her amazing beauty.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li who was very sexy to begin with, appeared ever so dignified in the golden battle skirt. However, her charming eyes were still gleaming, especially when she was looking at Qing Shui. She caused him to feel a tingling feeling as if he was sapped of all his strength.</p>
 <p>“Demoness!” Qing Shui still felt that this word best described her. Between her steps, she gave off a feeling as if she had flames which would cause others to drown in wild imagination.</p>
 <p>“Do I look good?” Huoyun Liu-Li sashayed over to Qing Shui and made a swirl around on the spot. Her long black hair that covered her shoulders was able to complement her feminine charms.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Saying this, Qing Shui took out another bangle. When he saw Huoyun Liu-Li acting slightly spoiled as she reached out her slender hand, Qing Shui looked towards Canghai Mingyue, embarrassed.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue, on the other hand, smiled as if she had not seen a thing!</p>
 <p>“How can you put it on for Sister Mingyue but can’t be bothered with me?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s blaming tone made Qing Shui stunned. Canghai Mingyue looked towards Huoyun Liu-Li in surprise, however, her pretty face was dyed red with a blush.</p>
 <p>“Why would I… it couldn’t be more welcomed… ” Qing Shui quickly put it on for Huoyun Liu-Li, as he was brooding over how Huoyun Liu-Li would chance upon the scene where he put on the bangle for Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“For these few days, don’t leave this please if there’s nothing important. Pass those to Senior. I hope that they’ll be of some use.” Qing Shui handed over the remaining things in his hands to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>Having gotten used to it, Huoyun Liu-Li was very surprised when she first put on the boots Qing Shui first forged. She did not ask anything even though she was still surprised. She only felt very happy to know that everything was made by Qing Shui, as if it was very normal.</p>
 <p>“Yueyue, after you’ve put them on, remember to let me take a look!” Qing Shui called out towards the two ladies who had not gone far.</p>
 <p>What he got in return were Huoyun Liu-Li’s gigglings and Canghai Mingyue’s blaming glance!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw Canghai Mingyue, he knew that the past events changed her, or made her put down her arrogance!</p>
 <p>During breakfast, the Canghai couple looked at Qing Shui, brimming with smiles. Even Canghai Mingyue was slightly embarrassed when she saw their gazes.</p>
 <p>“Thank you Qing Shui. With these items of yours, I’ll be able to fend off more than ten additional moves!” Canghai smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you’re being too modest. This time around, it’ll be a fight with our lives on the line.” Qing Shui grinned and said, appearing very honest. The two ladies who were looking at this scene could not even believe it, especially for Canghai Mingyue. There were several occasions when Qing Shui smiled very lewdly at her. However, seeing how honest he was smiling now, she had found it strangely unbelievable.</p>
 <p>“Alright, but if there are any changes to the situation, you all must listen to my arrangement.” Canghai looked towards Qing Shui, saying very seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a sigh and nodded. He knew that Canghai’s arrangements would be for him to take Canghai Mingyue and run… </p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue’s gaze were slightly dim, but she did not speak a word. However, her stubborn gaze had told the others of her decision. Canghai smiled. When the time comes, he would naturally have a way to let Qing Shui take her away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went to the blacksmith store in the morning and saw that Hu You was around. When Hu You saw him, he walked over happily!</p>
 <p>“I mastered the Qi Movement, I mastered the Qi Movement!” Hu You said the same line twice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and said, “Today, you can learn this set of hammering technique.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not close the door to the blacksmith shop. He was afraid that the dignified middle-aged man dress in purple would come again. The human traffic in the streets and in the store could still be able to hold some reservations.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shared the main points of the Thousand Hammer Technique. He taught him how to exert his strength, and did a slow demonstration before he looked at Hu You’s attempt at forging from the side.</p>
 <p>The current Hu You had long recovered from his ailment after receiving treatment from Qing Shui. His muscular build had even more strength than before.</p>
 <p>Until half the day was gone, Qing Shui felt that Hu You could already use the Thousand Hammer Technique, but without fluency. He had initially planned on giving him two more Strength-Enhancing Fruits, but it was a pity that he had nothing left other than an Agility-Enhancing Fruit kept aside for emergency purposes. This fruit was kept aside as a means for Qing Shui to save himself and create an escape route. That was why he had been holding onto one all this while, just for that spike in agility for fifteen minutes.</p>
 <p>After falling into a daze for a while, Qing Shui looked at Hu You and said, “Brother Hu, I won’t have any use for this blacksmith store anymore. I may never come back here again. You must practice this hammering technique as well as that Qi Movement.”</p>
 <p>“Why are you leaving?” Hu You asked, feeling a bit surprise and sad.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded, “All good things will come to an end someday. I’m very happy to have met Brother Hu. If fate allows, we will meet again. I’m here to bid my goodbye to Brother Hu.”</p>
 <p>Hu You furrowed his brows and let out a sigh after a while. “Brother, you are meant to do great things. If you were to pass by here one day, you must come and visit your elder brother. If there are no accidents, I will likely not leave this place.”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Hu You cheered up. He was thankful towards this handsome young man and knew that it was impossible for him to stay in this blacksmith store forever.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll come back to visit you in the future. Take care!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took his leave, not feeling that gloomy. Although Hu You looked like his eldest brother, he was not him. Qing Shui also wanted to give him a peace of mind. Since they were going to part, they might as well be more straightforward about it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left. He had initially wanted to instruct Hu You not to leave Southern City within half a year, but when he heard that he had no plans to leave, he was relieved. After all, Qing Shui was worried that those people he had come into contact with would fall prey to the Immortal Sword Sect. If they did not leave, they would generally be safe.</p>
 <p>Only when Qing Shui returned to Canghai’s residence did he feel assured. Unknowingly, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li had entered his heart, and he could not bear to cut them off.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not help but recall the reason behind this adventure. Initially, he had planned to come to Greencloud Continent to gain experience and train himself. He had not expected that Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li would come together with him. As time passed by, feelings grew. Regardless of what kind of feelings they were, Qing Shui did not have many friends, but treated Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li as his companions.</p>
 <p>It was to the extent that sometimes, Qing Shui would feel that their relationship was not as simple as just friends, but not that of love. Qing Shui did not expect this, but it was a complicated and entangled relationship.</p>
 <p>When he went back and saw that Canghai Mingyue was standing by the pond again and in a daze, Qing Shui knew that she was feeling worried again about leaving it to his arrangements.</p>
 <p>“Yueyue, don’t worry. Come, let Elder Brother give you a hug…”</p>
