 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 318 Feng Clan's Elder Yun</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Very soon, two Energy Fruit went down his stomach, and he felt a strange surge of energy grow from within his body, and it quickly extended out throughout his body, even through his brain. At that moment, Qing Shui noticed that something was very different.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He first noticed that his mind was now very clear, and it held a special refreshness. He then noticed that his vision had became very strong, and he was even able to see a single speck of dust a hundred meters away. While his abilities were strong previously, they were not as terrifying as they were now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Next, he noticed a big difference in his Spiritual Sense. Previously, he could only focus his energy in a particular direction up to a distance of 50 meters, but now he could sense things from all directions, up to 50 meters. </span></p>
  <p><span style>This made Qing Shui very satisfied, it was a qualitative improvement. Do not look down on the ability to extend the senses out in all directions up to 50 meters; it was the greatest improvement to be able to apply his Spiritual Sense on all of his surroundings at once.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It allowed him to sense everything that happened around him at the same time, just like a person standing on the rooftop who looked down on the courtyard, and everything was in full view. However, if the person stood in the courtyard, he would only be able to see the full view upon turning his body around.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was the Spiritual Sense's qualitative improvement. Many people were not able to breakthrough to this stage in all their lives. Without this breakthrough, they would never be able to become one of the strongest warriors.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At present, Qing Shui's improvement was like reaching the rooftop from the courtyard, and it was why he felt especially happy. As long as he could increase the distance upon which he could apply his Spiritual Sense sense in the future, he would be able to sense his surroundings through his Spiritual Sense, and could do a lot of things, including escaping dangers and, tailing someone else...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Time passed very quickly and another half a month passed by. Qing Shui exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and seeing that it was not yet noon, he planned to head to the back of the mountain to take a look at those beast-shaped stone monuments. After all, Qing Shui had gained a lot from them already.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui now no longer observed how many or how few people there were, and headed straight for the Frenzied Bull stone monument. He took another look at it, then moved on to the next one.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Look, that's our Starmoon Hall's Qing Shui. How is it? Isn't he tall and valiant?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>A voice rang out, causing Qing Shui to feel a bit speechless, but he did not turn to see who it was. It was not the first time he had heard things like this</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Now all of Starday Hall's men are all rubbing their palms, itching for an opportunity to fight against Qing Shui. "</span></p>
  <p><span style>A young man smiled and continued after the other man who had spoken.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I heard that that there's only one condition to determine who's the next Chief Disciple for Starday Hall, and that is to defeat Qing Shui." There were always people who wanted to take part in excitement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>News of Qing Shui having defeated Song Lang had caused Qing Shui to rapidly rise in fame. Most of the people discussed Qing Shui's level of cultivation, as well as they guessed the rank order for the competition between the various halls next year. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui however was focused on the stone monument, and saw that what was engraved on it was actually a type of plant, and it was one which Qing Shui was familiar with!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Vermillion Fruit!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui did not understand why the stone monuments were also carved with plants. He looked towards the next one and discovered that it was actually the Strength-Enhancing Fruit Tree.</span></p>
  <p><span style>For the next series of stone monuments, there were even some of people. Only after listening to the chattering from the people around did he find out that more than half of the stone monuments were of rare plants in the world of the nine continents, including trees of unique and mysterious fruits, unique and strange flowers, precious medicinal herbs, and the engraved beasts were those with powerful actions, they and were those which represented demonic beasts that would have unique traits!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui remembered all these medicinal herbs, fruits and trees, and soon, almost half the afternoon had passed. Suddenly, he felt someone tap on his shoulders. While there were a lot of people around, he did not expect that someone would tap on his shoulders.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He turned to discover that it was actually Huoyun Liu-Li. Qing Shui was stunned, and seeing that Canghai Mingyue was not there, he picked up that soft little hand and left the area of the stone monuments.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li had on a purple silk cloth that covered her face, and her sexy eyes brimmed with a smiles as they left the place amidst everyone's stunned and envious looks.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Why did you come?" Qing Shui smiled as he asked after they had reached a secluded place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Because I miss you, can't it be that?" Huoyun Liu-Li's eyes shone brightly with smiles as she looked at Qing Shui, not trying to avoid Qing Shui's flirtatious gaze.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Of course it can, I can't ask for anything better. Shall we also head to the back of the mountain to explore that amazing feeling?" Qing Shui was itching, so it was good to be able to take advantage of her verbally. Moreover, the exchange flirtatious words between a man and a woman was a spiritual enjoyment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I'm afraid that you would not dare. Let's go, Sister Mingyue is waiting for us there!" Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and said, as she pointed her other beautiful hand towards the far off distance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that there was no way that Huoyun Liu-Li would come all the way here to let him take advantage of her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, do you want to know who Sister Mingyue likes?" Huoyun Liu-Li looked at the smiling Qing Shui, as she felt very happy. She did not know since when, but this guy had gained a disposition which was so graceful and hard for someone not to like.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"You little demoness! Always keeping others in suspense!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>The two of them reached a place without many people. After all, they were at the back of the mountain, covered with gigantic boulders of varying height. Only the mountain path could be considered as smooth, but it was also filled with uneven bumps.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"As long as you can make me happy, maybe I'll tell you?"Huoyun Liu-Li narrowed her long and sexy pair of beautiful eyes slyly, and looked extremely feminine.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui grabbed onto her little hand, and felt very itchy inside since there was only her around, and Huoyun Liu-Li exuded her intoxicating charm.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui uncontrollably tugged on Huoyun Liu-Li's hand, and welcomed her into his arms.Qing Shui heard Huoyun Liu-Li let out a cry, which was just pouring fuel onto the fire, and it caused him to directly land a kiss on her lips over the silk cloth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His two hands could not stand the loneliness, one of them landed on that perky butt, and he felt that surprising elasticity and softness, while the other landed on one of her breasts, and gently rubbed. That wonderful feeling caused Qing Shui to lose control.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li did not expect Qing Shui to be so brazen either, and in a short moment, a few of her sensitive spots were attacked. As she felt shocks and numb all over, she fell limp into Qing Shui's arms, at a loss she let out slight panting sounds. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui's gaze landed on a spot not far away with a few big boulders, and he carried Huoyun Liu-Li. She realized he was walking over, and it caused her to start to panick.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Ahh, Qing Shui, you rascal, put me down. What are you doing?" Huoyun Liu-Li could sense the the changes to Qing Shui's body, knowing full well that it was very dangerous to lite up a fire within a man, but she was full of anticipation for Qing Shui. However, when it was time to face the real thing, she got scared, and felt that it was too rash to do it in the wilderness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui did not say a word, and only looked at Huoyun Liu-Li's anxious beautiful eyes, with the one hand still on her well-rounded butt, and he even went ahead to reach inside her clothes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With nothing to stand in the way of him feeling that beautiful butt directly, Qing Shui was intoxicated. That smoothness instantaneously brought him an indescribable feeling. It was if it was the smoothest silk, and he was unwilling to part with it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Ahhh, Qing Shui, don't be like this. I don't want my first time to be like this..." Huoyun Liu-Li panicked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui did not say anything. He had initially wanted to give her a scare and to take a little advantage of her, but thinking of how he was flared up by her each time, Qing Shui's hand dipped into her warm p*ssy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Ahh, Qing Shui, I don't want my first time to be here. I'll go to your room tonight, alright?" Huoyun Liu-Li hung her arms over Qing Shui's neck, and anxiously stuttered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was stunned, and smiled as he looked at the Huoyun Liu-Li who was so embarrassed that she could not lift up her head, and said, "Come to my room at night for?" Qing Shui could not help but want to tease her a little. He did not believe the little demoness' words.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I'll do whatever you want to do." Huoyun Liu-Li's seductive eyes looked at Qing Shui prettily, causing blood to gush up to his brain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This line was also what led to Qing Shui dipping in one of his fingers into a warm spot, which caused Huoyun Liu-Li to trembled, and she closed her legs shut together tightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"It's a deal,. Tonight, you'll come to my room. I'll trust you for this once!" Qing Shui smiled and said, as he used his fingers to probe a little inside before he took it out. After all, Canghai Mingyue was still waiting for him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li was put down by Qing Shui, with her body completely limp, as Qing Shui smiled and supported her!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui thought about it and felt that he was a bit too much in a hurry. Since when did his self-control become so weak? He looked awkwardly at how Huoyun Liu-Li was staring at him grievously, as he rubbed his nose.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A light fragrance drifted to his nose, almost not existent, but it gave one a linger of yearning, and the urge to want to smell it. One could only find this fragrance on someone one likes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li's eyes immediately misted up. She knew full fell where that index finger was earlier.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"You're so disgusting!" As she said that, she pushed away Qing Shui's hands, and ran forward. That beautiful back view, and especially those charming steps, with the slightly sway of her butt.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shui once again walked alongside her, she had already regained her composure!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui held onto Huoyun Liu-Li's hand lightly, but she only looked and smiled at Qing Shui, which caused him to feel confused.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Where's Mingyue? Liu-Li, didn't you say that she's waiting for us?" Qing Shui did not see Canghai Mingyue at all and they were about to leave the back of the mountain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Oh, maybe she couldn't wait and went back first!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui: "..."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt very gloomy, since the reason he had stopped was primarily because Huoyun Liu-Li said that Canghai Mingyue had been waiting for them. If he knew this was the case, he would probably be having one hell of a time with Huoyun Liu-Li right now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Liu-Li, I'll be waiting for you tonight!" Qing Shui grinned and said just as Huoyun Liu-Li had started to leave.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Mmm mmm, keep the door open for me tonight!" Huoyun Liu-Li smile prettily and said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui watched as that beautiful back view disappeared, and ignored that last sentence!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui noticed that Huoyun Liu-Li's current level of cultivation was at a stage where her progress was very fast, so he wanted to wait a little longer. This way, it would be killing two birds with one stone, and not only would it then be able to recover her beauty, but it could also increase her powers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As he walked towards his own residence, Qing Shui now would sense envious gazes no matter where he went. Of course, there were also gazes of jealousy as well as feelings of love from some girls. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Man were afraid to gain fame, while pigs were afraid to gain weight. Qing Shui smiled bitterly, and shook his head. He did not like this feeling, so he left very quickly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui headed up to his place, but felt a little uneasy. He immediately sent his Spiritual Sense out. Qing Shui smiled bitterly, because as he stood at the entrance to his room, &nbsp;he could sense that there was someone in the room.</span></p>

 <p><span style>"Now all of Starday Hall's men are all rubbing their palms, itching for an opportunity to fight against Qing Shui. "</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man smiled and continued after the other man who had spoken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I heard that that there's only one condition to determine who's the next Chief Disciple for Starday Hall, and that is to defeat Qing Shui." There were always people who wanted to take part in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>News of Qing Shui having defeated Song Lang had caused Qing Shui to rapidly rise in fame. Most of the people discussed Qing Shui's level of cultivation, as well as they guessed the rank order for the competition between the various halls next year. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui however was focused on the stone monument, and saw that what was engraved on it was actually a type of plant, and it was one which Qing Shui was familiar with!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vermillion Fruit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui did not understand why the stone monuments were also carved with plants. He looked towards the next one and discovered that it was actually the Strength-Enhancing Fruit Tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the next series of stone monuments, there were even some of people. Only after listening to the chattering from the people around did he find out that more than half of the stone monuments were of rare plants in the world of the nine continents, including trees of unique and mysterious fruits, unique and strange flowers, precious medicinal herbs, and the engraved beasts were those with powerful actions, they and were those which represented demonic beasts that would have unique traits!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui remembered all these medicinal herbs, fruits and trees, and soon, almost half the afternoon had passed. Suddenly, he felt someone tap on his shoulders. While there were a lot of people around, he did not expect that someone would tap on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned to discover that it was actually Huoyun Liu-Li. Qing Shui was stunned, and seeing that Canghai Mingyue was not there, he picked up that soft little hand and left the area of the stone monuments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li had on a purple silk cloth that covered her face, and her sexy eyes brimmed with a smiles as they left the place amidst everyone's stunned and envious looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did you come?" Qing Shui smiled as he asked after they had reached a secluded place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Because I miss you, can't it be that?" Huoyun Liu-Li's eyes shone brightly with smiles as she looked at Qing Shui, not trying to avoid Qing Shui's flirtatious gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course it can, I can't ask for anything better. Shall we also head to the back of the mountain to explore that amazing feeling?" Qing Shui was itching, so it was good to be able to take advantage of her verbally. Moreover, the exchange flirtatious words between a man and a woman was a spiritual enjoyment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm afraid that you would not dare. Let's go, Sister Mingyue is waiting for us there!" Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and said, as she pointed her other beautiful hand towards the far off distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that there was no way that Huoyun Liu-Li would come all the way here to let him take advantage of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, do you want to know who Sister Mingyue likes?" Huoyun Liu-Li looked at the smiling Qing Shui, as she felt very happy. She did not know since when, but this guy had gained a disposition which was so graceful and hard for someone not to like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You little demoness! Always keeping others in suspense!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them reached a place without many people. After all, they were at the back of the mountain, covered with gigantic boulders of varying height. Only the mountain path could be considered as smooth, but it was also filled with uneven bumps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As long as you can make me happy, maybe I'll tell you?"Huoyun Liu-Li narrowed her long and sexy pair of beautiful eyes slyly, and looked extremely feminine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui grabbed onto her little hand, and felt very itchy inside since there was only her around, and Huoyun Liu-Li exuded her intoxicating charm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui uncontrollably tugged on Huoyun Liu-Li's hand, and welcomed her into his arms.Qing Shui heard Huoyun Liu-Li let out a cry, which was just pouring fuel onto the fire, and it caused him to directly land a kiss on her lips over the silk cloth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His two hands could not stand the loneliness, one of them landed on that perky butt, and he felt that surprising elasticity and softness, while the other landed on one of her breasts, and gently rubbed. That wonderful feeling caused Qing Shui to lose control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li did not expect Qing Shui to be so brazen either, and in a short moment, a few of her sensitive spots were attacked. As she felt shocks and numb all over, she fell limp into Qing Shui's arms, at a loss she let out slight panting sounds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui's gaze landed on a spot not far away with a few big boulders, and he carried Huoyun Liu-Li. She realized he was walking over, and it caused her to start to panick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahh, Qing Shui, you rascal, put me down. What are you doing?" Huoyun Liu-Li could sense the the changes to Qing Shui's body, knowing full well that it was very dangerous to lite up a fire within a man, but she was full of anticipation for Qing Shui. However, when it was time to face the real thing, she got scared, and felt that it was too rash to do it in the wilderness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui did not say a word, and only looked at Huoyun Liu-Li's anxious beautiful eyes, with the one hand still on her well-rounded butt, and he even went ahead to reach inside her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With nothing to stand in the way of him feeling that beautiful butt directly, Qing Shui was intoxicated. That smoothness instantaneously brought him an indescribable feeling. It was if it was the smoothest silk, and he was unwilling to part with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahhh, Qing Shui, don't be like this. I don't want my first time to be like this..." Huoyun Liu-Li panicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui did not say anything. He had initially wanted to give her a scare and to take a little advantage of her, but thinking of how he was flared up by her each time, Qing Shui's hand dipped into her warm p*ssy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahh, Qing Shui, I don't want my first time to be here. I'll go to your room tonight, alright?" Huoyun Liu-Li hung her arms over Qing Shui's neck, and anxiously stuttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was stunned, and smiled as he looked at the Huoyun Liu-Li who was so embarrassed that she could not lift up her head, and said, "Come to my room at night for?" Qing Shui could not help but want to tease her a little. He did not believe the little demoness' words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'll do whatever you want to do." Huoyun Liu-Li's seductive eyes looked at Qing Shui prettily, causing blood to gush up to his brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This line was also what led to Qing Shui dipping in one of his fingers into a warm spot, which caused Huoyun Liu-Li to trembled, and she closed her legs shut together tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's a deal,. Tonight, you'll come to my room. I'll trust you for this once!" Qing Shui smiled and said, as he used his fingers to probe a little inside before he took it out. After all, Canghai Mingyue was still waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li was put down by Qing Shui, with her body completely limp, as Qing Shui smiled and supported her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui thought about it and felt that he was a bit too much in a hurry. Since when did his self-control become so weak? He looked awkwardly at how Huoyun Liu-Li was staring at him grievously, as he rubbed his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light fragrance drifted to his nose, almost not existent, but it gave one a linger of yearning, and the urge to want to smell it. One could only find this fragrance on someone one likes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li's eyes immediately misted up. She knew full fell where that index finger was earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're so disgusting!" As she said that, she pushed away Qing Shui's hands, and ran forward. That beautiful back view, and especially those charming steps, with the slightly sway of her butt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Shui once again walked alongside her, she had already regained her composure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui held onto Huoyun Liu-Li's hand lightly, but she only looked and smiled at Qing Shui, which caused him to feel confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where's Mingyue? Liu-Li, didn't you say that she's waiting for us?" Qing Shui did not see Canghai Mingyue at all and they were about to leave the back of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, maybe she couldn't wait and went back first!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui: "..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui felt very gloomy, since the reason he had stopped was primarily because Huoyun Liu-Li said that Canghai Mingyue had been waiting for them. If he knew this was the case, he would probably be having one hell of a time with Huoyun Liu-Li right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Liu-Li, I'll be waiting for you tonight!" Qing Shui grinned and said just as Huoyun Liu-Li had started to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mmm mmm, keep the door open for me tonight!" Huoyun Liu-Li smile prettily and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui watched as that beautiful back view disappeared, and ignored that last sentence!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui noticed that Huoyun Liu-Li's current level of cultivation was at a stage where her progress was very fast, so he wanted to wait a little longer. This way, it would be killing two birds with one stone, and not only would it then be able to recover her beauty, but it could also increase her powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he walked towards his own residence, Qing Shui now would sense envious gazes no matter where he went. Of course, there were also gazes of jealousy as well as feelings of love from some girls. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Man were afraid to gain fame, while pigs were afraid to gain weight. Qing Shui smiled bitterly, and shook his head. He did not like this feeling, so he left very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui headed up to his place, but felt a little uneasy. He immediately sent his Spiritual Sense out. Qing Shui smiled bitterly, because as he stood at the entrance to his room, &nbsp;he could sense that there was someone in the room.</span></p>
