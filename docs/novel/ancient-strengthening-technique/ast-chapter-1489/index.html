Let’s first talk about our matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, how can I help you?” Qing Shui said. After all, he was not very familiar with her family and home, so he really did not know what loose ends he had to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter what, it will be fine as long as you can cope to a certain point. Anyway, you don't know the Xue Clan. When the time comes, leave it to me.” Xue Ruo said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had originally intended to open a medical pavilion here, but after getting this information, there was no way he could build it. He would probably have to leave the Grand Xia Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xue Clan was very atmospheric. The huge manor in the forest belonged to them. With their large fortune, this was the Xue Clan’s headquarters. Basically, the main family lived here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Ruo and Qing Shui lived with a few people off in the remote distance, but the location of the manor was particularly good. It was a real manor, not some kind of small village home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The land and trees were the cause of the thriving scene. If one looked carefully, the the building here was higher than the surrounding area. standing on the roof, one could see everything in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the people respectfully shouting miss, Xue Ruo nodded and walked directly with Qing Shui toward the nearest hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The buildings here were grand. Even the pavilion seemed like a house. Having arrived, Xue Ruo’s grandfather and a line of people came out, happy to see Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You came. Let’s walk, please. I waited for you." The old master pulled Qing Shui aside earnestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart sighed. The old master was so attentive. He probably should be able to feel his own strength. Being satisfied in Qing Shui’s strength, the old master made everything a lot simpler.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave polite responses, and then greeted everyone one by one with Xue Ruo. These people were the closest clan members to Xue Ruo. Qing Shui understood that the old master was making it very official ...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although such a thing was a formality, it was very sincere. If he really did want to marry this woman, then the present picture was truly wonderful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong and Lin Fei were happy and smiling, often looking at Qing Shui from time to time. Lin Fei even teased the two, making Qing Shui feel dumbfounded. Qing Shui would rather look for a dragon to kill then to face a matter like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to be with Yiye Jiange, there was no way but to tolerate the situation, thinking of the speechless look on the faces of the members of the Xue Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feast was huge. There were more than 10 tables. Qing Shui and several other people including the elders sat at the main table, even though Qing Shui had repeatedly refused initially. But, he failed in front of the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a guilty conscience towards the elderly. but think as if family members are so, it is their own strength, and if replaced by weak strength, it is estimated that talking to yourself is a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were not him, but another powerful young man, the treatment would be the same. Qing Shui thought of this, and after some contemplation, decided his heart was a bit too anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, do you mind if I call you like this!" The old master said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'It should be so. Old master, you're more than welcome to.” Qing Shui was not anxious. This scene was nothing, and even the members of the Xue Clan were more nervous than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui where are you from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, are you married?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smoothly replied. When asked if he was married, Qing Shui thought and nodded. “Old master, I already have a few wives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew lying was pointless, so he simply admitted it boldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I like honest people. I did not mistake you at all Qing Shui. For a formidable man, a few women are normal things. As long as you are able to make them happy, then everyone will be happy. Those men who are incompetent to marry a woman are not happy.” The old master said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not expect the elder would immediately reply like this. This made Xue Ruo and some women who were present feel a little awkward. However, the old do not fear pressure when speaking, and what the old master said was not wrong. It was said that a formidable man had at least three wives and four concubines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This world and the previous world were different. Here a strong man with three wives and four concubines was very normal, but what was advocated in the past world was the equality between men and women. In fact, there are also many wealthy people with three wives and four concubines back then, but that was only in secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, what are your plans?” The old master said with a look to Qing Shui, looking forward to hearing his answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought the elder was actually thinking about the development of the family. He looked at the old man seriously and said,"I believe in true friendships. What elder says I understand, but maybe I cannot marry her right now. You should know your own granddaughter. Let's have more contact first. Do not worry. No matter what, I will not let you down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui said this very vaguely, but the meaning was very clear. He didn’t want to rush things, but he wouldn’t be idle either. Xue Ruo was unruly, but it was not that he didn’t want to get married.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Qing Shui’s reply, the old man smiled with satisfaction and said happily, "Well, let’s do as you say. I am old and this world is of the young."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui knew that the old master was an old fox. His purpose had been achieved, so he naturally did not care about anything else. A powerhouse paid great attention to one’s words, actions, and shows of faith. His old eyes were not blind. He could feel that Qing Shui was not a bad person.</span></p>

Both sides had achieved their goals. Naturally, at this affectionate feast, many people came over and toasted Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Almost after Qing Shui "liquor" first leave the field, the Xue Clan arranged for a manor courtyard for Qing Shui. Xue Ruo and Qing Shui had Yin Tong and Lin Fei leave first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the courtyard Qing Shui became impatient and asked, “Where is Yiye Jiange?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course, she is in the Ice Domain Dynasty.” Xue Ruo said very simply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” Qing Shui was surprised for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No. When I first met with t big sister, we spent more than half a month together. I inadvertently saw your portrait, and she then told me that she wanted to head to the Ice Domain Dynasty.” Xue Ruo was a little disturbed as she looked at Qing Shui’s pale face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also knew Xue Ruo would not lie to him, although the news was not accurate, but it was better than nothing, the Ice Domain Dynasty was so big, looking for a person was like finding a needle in a haystack, but Yiye Jiange was not the average person, so it should not be too difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're going to leave in three days. Your family knows what you are capable of, and now, we're even." Qing Shui looked at Xue Ruo and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmph, tearing down the bridge after crossing it. My big sister would beat you if she knew you were doing this to me." Xue Ruo retorted in indignation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps because of Yiye Jiange, but Xue Ruo was like a little girl in front of the Qing Shui. Perhaps she did not even feel it herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're going to the Ice Domain Dynasty. Do you want to go with us?" Qing Shui walked towards the room, and shouted from one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course I will, otherwise my family will not believe our marriage." Xue Ruo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his brows. He thought he should think more before speaking again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days of time quickly passed. Qing Shui also helped cure the Lang Xuan couple. The small building was returned to them, of course, but he kept the Shadowless Flying Shuttle and the precious herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Knowing that Qing Shui had to go to the Ice Domain Dynasty, Lang Xuan was very happy. He told him that they also wanted to return to the Ice Domain Dynasty, and that they could all travel together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui naturally did not reject his offer of being a guide. He felt that it was good to keep Lang Xuan around as they headed to the Ice Domain Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Xue Ruo said their goodbyes. Xue Ruo said she had to leave with Qing Shui, and the clan did not show any objection and happily agreed. They told Qing Shui to take good care of the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui at this time felt close to the old master. Towards his earnest request, Qing Shui naturally complied. After all, since he had brought her along, he would protect Xue Ruo in every way possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not think about matters this time and had come to the Vast Sea Continent accidentally, Yet, he had gotten news of Yiye Jiange. This was a huge gain, the other being the Shadowless Fly Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally Qing Shui planned to come out. In so many years, the mood was rarely this relaxed, yet this time he had unexpectedly gained such a big harvest. He was satisfied, he &nbsp;found Yiye Jiange, and can once again ask for a wish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Tantai Lingyan matter, it needed some time. He had waited for so long anyways, and there was no need to be more anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, a few people were riding Lang Xuan mounts. They were huge like the heavenly lion, but mutated. With this powerful mount, Qing Shui was sure of the Lang Xuan’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the Great Xia Dynasty to the Ice Domain Dynasty, they had to go through several other dynasties. The two dynasties were not directly next to each other. There were a few other dynasties between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not use the Nine Continents Step. From prior experience, there was no need to let anyone know of the Nine Continents Step, so they rode the heavenly lions to hurry along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of the heavenly lions was still very scary. They safely arrived at the Ice Domain Dynasty one month later. The vast expanse of the Vast Sea Continent once again shocked Qing Shui. It seemed that the Nine Continents Step was still quite effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the place to be named the Ice Domain Dynasty was not wrong. The weather here was always winter and the entire dynasty was like an ice world. It frequently snowed here and was almost always cold. This was an ice world, and many buildings being ice sculptures were common.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shuo did not know about the others, but he felt that it was very beautiful here, like an image of frozen pear blossoms. The people could be seen wearing thick cotton-padded clothes whereas normally, one would see practitioners wearing thin clothing. There was an ice sea, frozen lakes, glaciers, all suitable for the growth of cold plants ...</span></p>
