Wound</strong></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you hurt?” Qing Shui asked intentionally even though he already knew the answer. He was grabbing her cold hand which was as smooth as jade. The comfort he felt while doing so was something which words couldn’t describe. But now, he knew that treating her wounds would come as one of his priorities. Even if the purpose of curing her was just to look for Yiye Jiange, he must help bring her back to health.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I am afraid I might not be able to send you there.” The woman sounded sad when she answered. It was unclear if she was feeling sad for herself or Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt really weird. Why would a woman think about such a thing at this moment? The woman’s aura was also disordered in a very strange way. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have said such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not worry, for I am a gifted physician. As long as it’s someone whom I have taken a fancy to, not even the God of Death can take them away from me.” Qing Shui said with a smile. As he was saying so, he transferred a wave of Nature Energy into her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s sentence somehow sounded a bit faulty. The woman was wearing a conical hat, and Qing Shui didn’t overthink his words. The woman had also forgotten about other things for now. At this kind of crucial moment, everything else would seem unimportant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for your good intentions, but I am well aware of my own conditions. There is no hope left for me.” The woman let out a sigh and said in a certain tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How would you know before you even try?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pulled her and led her to his own room. The spot where they were at was actually close to it. It was almost as if he was half-carrying the woman into his room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman didn’t resist. While he was carrying her, Qing Shui had already managed to find out the reasons behind her disordered aura. A certain warrior had struck her with two waves of cold and violent aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t sure if the attack was from a warrior or a demonic beast. Nevertheless, it wasn’t important. The priority for him was to force out the aura in her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was slowly reaching towards the aura with his Nature Energy. However, the aura didn’t give his Nature Energy the slightest chance for interaction. There were thousands of paths which the meridians could take within a human body. As long as the aura intended to avoid a certain energy, it could do so with ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But for Qing Shui, it wasn’t a difficult task to search for it. In the past, he had helped other people with similar treatments. Only the case of this woman proved to be a bit unique. It might be slightly harder than the cases he had dealt with before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used his Nature Energy to prevent the intrusion of the aura into her mind, dantian and other important spots. Once they intruded her brain, things would become quite a handful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s body was getting colder and colder. At the moment, both of Qing Shui’s hands were like two popsicles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman seemed to be slowly losing her consciousness. Suddenly, she embraced Qing Shui tightly with both her hands and said, “Cold… I don’t feel so well…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Qing Shui, who was supposed to have a tough physique, also felt the coldness. Though the body in his arms might be detailed and fine, it was cold to the point that it could hardly cause him to come up with any bad intentions. What he was going through now felt just the same as embracing the ice sculpture of a beautiful woman in the winter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nature Energy and Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique within Qing Shui were revolving at a fast speed. They had managed to cancel out the coldness within her body. But as soon as this was achieved, Qing Shui felt a certain reaction in his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the thought that this woman was most likely related to Yiye Jiange came to mind. He then carried on and started wondering whether she was a human or someone of the Aquatics? Thinking up to this point, almost half of the fiery spirit within Qing Shui’s heart subsided. Besides, taking advantage of other people’s perilous states wasn’t his favorite thing to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman embraced Qing Shui and snuggled up within Qing Shui’s chest as much as she could. However, Qing Shui could feel that at this moment, her eyes seemed to have become a bit clearer. Although her face might be separated by the conical hat, Qing Shui was still able to see her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be scared, everything will be fine soon.” Qing Shui comforted her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman suddenly took out a token and gave it to Qing Shui, “Take this. This token will give you instructions on how to head into Ice Ocean Domain’s Ocean God Palace. In there, you will get to meet your wife. Tell her to protect the Ice Ocean Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t take it, but the woman insisted on putting the token onto Qing Shui’s hand, “To me, Jiange is like my own sister. She received my mother’s inheritance. In other words, we might be even closer than blood-related sisters. Oh, and also, she is the Palace Mistress of Ice Ocean Domain’s Ocean God Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. To think that Yiye Jiange was now the Palace Mistress of Ocean God Palace. Qing Shui had little knowledge regarding the Aquatics. The only thing he was aware of was that the ocean in this world was as large as the space occupied by land. It might possibly be even larger than the land itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There isn’t only one Ocean King Palace within the Ice Ocean Domain. There were a few Ocean King Palaces nearby that were trying to harm us. I came out this time to look for assistance. Unfortunately, I fell into the enemies’ traps. Jiange is very powerful. She has the Nine-headed Crystal Beast. If she is a bit more careful, she should be able to protect the Palace. If she is still unable to protect it with her own strength, I will let her dispatch the Ocean King Palace’s forces.” The woman was exerting a lot of effort just to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have told you before that you will be fine.” Qing Shui could tell that the woman didn’t even have enough strength to stand. Although the body might belong to her, she wasn’t able to take control of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately carried her up. The woman breathed out gently, which she only did once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui put her down on his bed and took out the Gold Needle. But then, he remembered that he was in a hotel. If anyone were to come in and interrupt him, he would be in trouble. Qing Shui immediately moved out of the hotel while carrying her, and jumped through the window. He used his Nine Continents Step Effect and eventually came to a stop when he arrived at a mountain valley.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you planning to do……?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman sounded afraid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled upon hearing what she said, “As much as you consider me a beast, I don’t have such a strong sense of taste.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman heard Qing Shui’s words, but she didn’t seem to understand what he meant. She carried on and asked, “Strong sense of taste?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you worried that I will do something to you? Or, are you worried that I will only lay my hands on you once you died?” Qing Shui looked around his surroundings and set up a formation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman has finally understood what Qing Shui meant this time. She couldn’t help but say, “Not like you are anything good either. Why would Jiange like you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, Miss High and Mighty, it’s better if you conserve your energy to endure the pain which is to come later. Otherwise, you might cry and sneeze your nose off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui set up a formation for security purposes. After that, he summoned the Hell Nightmare Beast, the Dragon Slaying Beast as well as the Thunderous Beast. As for himself, he took out a bed from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and placed her on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I need you to remove your clothing in order for me to treat you.” Qing Shui didn’t intend to take advantage and peep at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was hesitating and didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am a physician. In the eyes of physicians, we don’t distinguish between women and men.” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you have already said that, what’s the point in asking me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hand and helped her remove her clothes. But at this moment, the woman said in a hurried tone, “Wait!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong?” Qing Shui asked in a strange tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t want to see you like this. I am not comfortable letting you treat my wounds with this kind of look. Why don’t you take off your disguise?” The woman said gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui agreed to it. He removed his disguise. In terms of look, he was also considered to be quite good-looking. He looked smart, but he didn’t give people the impression that he wasn’t manly. But the mark on his forehead, however, caused people to think that he was somehow gentle and reserved. This was a kind of charm belonging to a man. It appealed to both humble and also strong-willed women.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that Qing Shui wasn’t really content with how he looked. He would prefer himself to be more towards the masculine type. He wanted his body to be a bit bigger. In his previous incarnation, there was a thing known by people as “Mr. Perfect”. Although Qing Shui might be quite tall with his proportionate body, he didn’t look like the kind of masculine man. Deep in his heart, he would prefer to be the type with more muscles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took away her bamboo hat. The parts of her body where Qing Shui needed to inject needles in included her head. At the moment, when he saw the face of the woman, he was mesmerized.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The face which went into his eyes was a face which could potentially damage the country and cause sufferings to people. Qing Shui had never seen such a demoness before. However, Qing Shui felt that she was precisely what he thought she was. She had skin like jade, soft and white. Her brows were thin and long. Both of her eyes were beautiful enough to make men delirious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was definitely beautiful enough to bring chaos to the land. Qing Shui finally understood the reason behind her wearing a conical hat. Even though her eyes might be really seductive, they also contained a kind of elegance. To Qing Shui, her kind of beauty was at a totally different level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her nose was sharp and solid, giving people the feeling that she was a woman of temperament. Her lips and eyes were equally sexy, curved in a natural way. Her profile was truly charming. Overall, she owned a look that was bewitching to the core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qing Shui sensed a kind of aura from her body which didn’t belong to that of a human. Now, he was starting to feel convinced that she was from the legendary mermaid tribes. The reason being it was that it’s very difficult for humans to reach her level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She might not necessarily be more beautiful than Qin Qing, but compared to her, she was more alluring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed a bitter smile and looked at her, “I was confident before, but unfortunately, I may have to tell you that I am feeling less confident now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the woman was able to interpret what Qing Shui meant. She felt shocked. She never expected for this young man to regain his focus so quickly after seeing her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his arms and slowly took off her lapel. The woman closed her eyes due to the shyness she felt in her heart. She was feeling really complicated. If she didn’t let him cure her, she would die. Let alone at the moment, she was also helpless about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, she wasn’t convinced that Qing Shui would be able to cure her. She was just betting on this opportunity and giving it a try. She was reluctant to leave this world just like that. But now that her clothes were being taken off by a man, she felt really complicated. Life or virginity, which was more important?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I choose death, can you promise me not to take off my clothes?” At the moment when Qing Shui’s hands reached the woman’s lapel, the woman asked gently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t I tell you before? In the eye of a physician, there is no such thing as male or female. I will try my best not to touch your body.” As Qing Shui spoke, he pulled down the lapel on the woman with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took Qing Shui a huge amount of effort just to help her take off her clothes. As Qing Shui looked at the woman who was absolutely naked, he couldn’t help but think that this was the making of gods. The snowballs in front of her chest maintained its shape even when she was laying down. The pointy red spots on her breasts even made people feel their blood surging through their entire body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body was flawless. Similar to Yehuang Guwu, her body looked as smooth as jade. Her curve and her body shape brought Qing Shui to the brink of his self-control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He closed his eyes and calmed the fluctuation taking place in his heart before opening his eyes back again. He must rely on his eyes to find the positions. His Heavenly Vision Technique could help him pinpoint the two waves of cold aura accurately.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The long and slender legs of hers were a few times more alluring than the legs of even the most beautiful models from his previous incarnation. Their fine and exquisite contour was something which words couldn’t describe. It gave people the urge to take hold and not letting go as soon as they saw them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took out a Gold Needle which was about nine inches long. Following on, he started looking for the right positions and slowly injected the needles into her. He started off from her head. At times, he could inject a few needles at the same time whereas sometimes, he would fail to inject any needles even after an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t keep going on like this. It seems I may need to go back on my promise… But please believe me with my moral as a psychiatrist.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui was speaking, he lifted up one of his hands and very quickly, it shone brightly, as white as snow. At this moment, the woman opened up both of her eyes. She heard what Qing Shui said and hence, was feeling really nervous. But very quickly, she also managed to calm herself down. She was already in this kind of state, was there anything more which could be worse than this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his fore and middle finger, Qing Shui swiftly poked the woman a few times. Some of his pokes also landed right on top of the bulging spots on her body. His body immediately got numb upon contact with it.</span></p>
