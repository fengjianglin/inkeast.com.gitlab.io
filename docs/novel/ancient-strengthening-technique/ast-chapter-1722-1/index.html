 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of pain couldn’t be shared with others. That was human nature. If he was an ordinary person, nothing would have been wrong with him being like that. The problem was, he wasn’t. The position he had helped him determine his vision as well as desire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was long destined that he would have to face the pain alone. He had looked for psychiatrists, and even alchemists before. But he would only meet them with his disguise on. Unfortunately, none of them has got a clue on how to help him. It’s through a repeated process of trying yet receiving disappointing responses that he decided to give up on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he might have given up and stopped looking for psychiatrists, for someone like him who was at the prime of his life, it was the moment when his desire to get the things which he craved for would be the strongest. The women behind him were totally unable to be satisfied by him. Every time he saw their eyes that were filled with hidden grudges, he would feel as if his heart was pierced by a needle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the women even went to the extent of looking for another man behind his back. When he found out about it, he immediately murdered the both of them. Since then, he would occasionally find himself in a very angered and impatient mood, so much so that more than half of his women have been beaten up by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no one has been made aware about these things so far. Now that Qing Shui mentioned it out loud, he suddenly felt as if he was exposed in public. The first thing which he came to his mind was one of his women must have mentioned the matter to the public, so much so that he started to suspect that she must have somehow, found a way to be in contact with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. Despite that, he still held all of his anger in. Naturally, he would not admit these things. He looked at Qing Shui and revealed a cold smile, “What nonsense are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, nonsense? You lost half of your most important meridian near the Dantian positioned at your kidney. If it wasn’t for your formidable cultivation, it’s very likely that you would have been crippled immediately. Now, you are just an arrow at the end of its flight. Three years, I give you three years max, by then, you will be completely crippled.” Qing Shui said in a disdainful tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a man, if the Watermoon Cavern Lord was in his previous incarnation, he would have definitely been a successful billionaire. He would have definitely been a person above all others. As a successful man, even if he had money, authority and women, but on the condition that he could never be a proper man, this would have been a very miserable experience. Even if a person was to be faced with three options, whether to be wealthy, to have authority, or to be a man, the person would have most likely gone for the final option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the cavern lord didn’t retort. He has an extremely ugly look on his face. The reason being that he couldn’t be more clear that anyone with the things which Qing Shui said. Up until now, he was yet to be able to completely cure his injuries. It has been so many years, each year, the injuries would only get worse. When it first started, though it might be exhausting for him, he was at least still able to satisfy his women. But as time passed, it became tough for him to satisfy even one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most important reason why he wanted to marry Qing Hanye was in hope for Yin-Yang Mediation. Qing Hanye possessed the Nine Yang Body. If they were to mate, there was a huge chance that his meridians would be reborn and give birth to new meridians. Or if not, at the very least, they might help him recover his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why he wanted to marry Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine-Ying body wasn’t something which could be digested so easily. The risk it bore was huge. One mistake could cost his own life. Despite that, he still made up his mind to risk it. If he failed to recover, he would be better off dead. What meaning would his life have if he was to continue being like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s not a risk. He was uncertain on how long he could stand in this state. Humans were born to be gamblers. It was human nature to take risks. Especially during situations when they were left with nowhere to go, they wouldn’t fear risking anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s good that you are here today. There is one thing which I would like to tell you. I don’t like you, please cancel the marriage immediately.” Qing Hanye said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, the Watermoon Cavern Lord intended to say something. But he was completely stopped by what Qing Hanye said. This has caused him to be really enraged. He thought that it was because of the words Qing Shui said that made Qing Hanye so firmly rejected his marriage proposal. She must have viewed him as a useless man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All this while, Qing Shui had constantly been keeping an eye on the Watermoon Cavern Lord. He found him to be very miserable. He was also able to figure out the reason why he wanted to marry Qing Hanye. After all, it’s not rare to see Yin-Yang Duo Cultivation Techniques across the Nine Continents. It’s just that very few were able to cultivate it to the best it could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To think that I, Shui Yunfeng would be ridiculed by someone to this extent. Do you seriously think that just because you seem a little strong, that gives you the right to not put anyone in your eyes? Initially, I never intended to haggle so much with you guys as you guys are still very young. I am just going to repeat one more time, today, I am here to take Ye`Er back to Watermoon Cavern.” The cavern lord Shui Yunfeng recovered his usual expression and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t go with you. There is already someone whom I like. Other than him, I won’t dedicate my life to another men.” Qing Hanye shook her head and said in a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her master was smiling from the side. He didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take Ye`Er and leave! Kill whoever that tries to stand in our way!” Shui Yunfeng stood up and stomped out of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people behind him immediately made their way towards Qing Hanye. But right at this moment, Qing Shui slowly took a step forward and pushed himself out like a formless yet imposing mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I would like to see who dared to act so unbridled around here.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Shui Yunfeng. His eyes were all fired up with intention to battle against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are digging your own grave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the middle-aged, or rather, slightly old men shouted out loudly and charged his way towards Qing Shui. He thrust out his palm towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were all the right-hand men of Watermoon Cavern Lord. They provided the cave lord with significant aid. Not only so, they were also very powerful and loyal to him. They even possessed high positions within Watermoon Cavern itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui was looking at the palm thrust out by the old man, he revealed a disdainful laugh. It seemed that his opponents have yet to detect his true strength. The fact that the old man didn’t go all out meant that he was digging his own grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was getting closer to the old man’s palm. At the same time, the old man also didn’t have any intention to release his Qi Force. When it was about three feet away from Qing Shui, the Qi Force across the palm started surging and spinning violently like a tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui abruptly thrust out his palm. He countered against attack and landed his palm on the arm of the middle-aged man. A depressing noise came through. It was also accompanied by the clear noise of a breaking bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man flew backwards. Fresh blood could be seen rushing out of his nose and mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One move, that was all it took for him to heavily injure the man. Not to mention this was under the state when he still had more energy to spare. If he had gone all out, the man would have died immediately. Despite all that, this man was already considered to have done for. Though it might not cause him to totally lose his cultivation, he would still lose at least half of them.</span></p>

It’s almost as if everyone around was dead. Even Shui Yunfeng at this moment, couldn’t help but look at Qing Shui in disbelief. One move….. That was all it took for him to cripple one of his most capable right-hand men.</span></p>

Right at this moment, the remaining few people suddenly charged their way towards Qing Shui. It seemed they have figured out that the young man would be difficult to deal with. He was definitely not someone they could defeat in a one-on-one match.</span></p>

It seemed the young man’s strength was different from how the rumors said to be. According to the data he received, he shouldn’t be able to beat his right-hand men. How did he get so strong all of a sudden?</span></p>
