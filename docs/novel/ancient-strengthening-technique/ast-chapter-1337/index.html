 <p><strong>AST 1337 - Powerful Physique, Nv`Er Hong, the powerful Double Portion Medication!</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately understood Tantai Xuan’s thoughts after seeing her expression. Even though he didn’t understand all of it, at least he was able to interpret some of them. Hence, he approached her with a smile and held both of her hands and looked at her.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Tantai Xuan tried to avoid eye contact with each other the moment they met. However, Qing Shui still placed both of his hands onto her back and embraced her. Such a posture made her soft breasts become more supple and erect. The curve and protrusion made one’s blood race. It was especially attractive to the eye.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was enthusiastically petting her body, causing Tantai Xuan to no longer be able to calm herself down. She was someone who had seen the scene of what Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan were doing when they were both together before. Now, those scenes were yet again madly resurfacing in her mind again.</p>
 <p>Particularly at this moment when Qing Shui’s hand was right in front of her chest. This made her feel extremely nervous, so much so that she started feeling numb. It was a very hot feeling, like she was itching. In her brain was a scene where Qing Shui was suckling on Yu Ruyan’s soft breasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he mustn't make her feel embarrassed. He hugged her and kissed her earlobes with his lips. However, this action of his only made Tantai Xuan shiver more. She embraced him back tightly and stopped him from moving randomly.</p>
 <p>“Xuan`Er, have you missed me?” Qing Shui really enjoyed teasing the woman who kept on insisting that she didn’t like him.</p>
 <p>“No, I won’t miss you,” Tantai Xuan hugged Qing Shui and said in a playful tone.</p>
 <p>Actually, she didn’t know how different the tone she was speaking now compared to before. Even Qing Shui himself was shocked by it. Could it be that her entire personality had changed from secluding herself just once?</p>
 <p>Despite this, Qing Shui still thought about one possibility. Which was at the moment of her breakthrough, she came to comprehend a lot of things. For example, the relationship between herself and him. It was just that he also wasn’t clear on the exact way she looked at the relationship between them.</p>
 <p>“Then who do you miss?” Qing Shui smiled and continued teasing her.</p>
 <p>“I don’t miss anyone.”</p>
 <p>“So it is me who has thought too much. I have been missing that person every single day but she doesn’t seem to miss me back at all.” Qing Shui blew out some air near her ear.</p>
 <p>“You are nothing but a pervert. As if you will miss me.” At the moment when Tantai Xuan heard what Qing Shui said, she still felt really happy. Regardless of whether his word were true or not, she was still willing to listen to them. This was how a girl who was in her first relationship would think.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected this woman to still be so biased against him. It seemed like he would still need to slowly change her. But the fact that she was able to allow him to hug her meant that she was already starting to accept herself or perhaps, starting to accept him too.</p>
 <p>“You are right. I may be a pervert. But men were originally born to be perverts. This is the nature of humans. If they weren’t horny, how would you expect them to reproduce? Besides, which couples who love each other wouldn’t do dirty stuff?” Qing Shui smiled softly.</p>
 <p>“Thick-faced, crooked logic.” Tantai Xuan smiled as she spoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and gently let her go. After that, he grabbed her hand with one of his hands and Yu Ruyan’s hand with the other. Together, they advanced their way towards the bamboo building. Yehuang Guwu was already in there. Prior to this, Qing Shui was at the beach with the two girls.</p>
 <p>The two girls wanted to break free from Qing Shui’s hands which were holding them tightly. But because Qing Shui kept their hands really close to himself, they couldn’t do anything but let him continue holding them. Upon seeing Yehuang Guwu, Tantai Xuan smiled and said, “Master!”</p>
 <p>“Are you happy?” Yehuang Guwu smiled and asked. She went up to them and similarly held onto Yu Ruyan’s hand with one of her hands and Tantai Xuan’s with the other. Like this, the four had formed a circle holding onto each other’s hands.</p>
 <p>“We are going to let Qing Shui make us something delicious today. Let’s have an enjoyable dinner together and drink some alcohol.” Yehuang Guwu made a suggestion.</p>
 <p>“Yes, today is master’s birthday,” Tantai Xuan said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned and looked at Yehuang Guwu. Only now did he realize that other than the birthdays of his children and mother, he had not the slightest idea of when other people’s birthdays were. There’s no need to suspect whether he loved them or not. He wondered why, in the past, he had never thought about celebrating birthdays for them?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made three portions of Longevity Noodles. Even though Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan weren’t having their birthday, he also made plenty of other stuff. It was a very sumptuous dinner. He took out the best Nv`Er Hong (chinese wine). The moment when the girls realized that it was Nv`Er Hong, they blushed.</p>
 <p>Between men and women, only a husband and wife would have Nv`Er Hong together. Of course, two great masters could drink together, so could two women. But for a man and a woman to drink it together, it would mean they were husband and wife, particularly in this kind of situation. This was actually an unspoken rule.</p>
 <p>And now, seeing that Qing Shui was having Nv`Er Hong with the three girls, no words had to be said about what he meant by it. Actually, the two girls were also aware that both Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu also shared a unique relationship with each other. However, Tantai Xuan was someone who was aware of Yehuang Guwu’s secret. Though by the name of it, Tantai Xuan and Yehuang Guwu shared a master disciple relation, they were actually more like sisters to each other. They might be even closer than blood-related sisters. Now, Yu Ruyan had joined them.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu had long since expected a day like this to come. Hence, since the beginning, she had already treated Yu Ruyan like a sister of her own. It was not that she was someone who planned meticulously, it was just that things had developed and events had taken such a turn. Before doing anything, one would have to first take a peek into their heart.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan would also feel really happy when she saw Yehuang Guwu happy. If Yehuang Guwu could really be Qing Shui’s wife, she would feel even happier than when herself and Qing Shui turned into husband and wife. She knew that Yu Ruyan wasn’t Qing Shui’s only women. Hence, since she was going to commit herself to him, she wouldn’t mind having her master join as well. This way, they would be able to stick together forever. Sisters being able to stay together was also a sort of happiness that couldn’t be described in words.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yan, let’s toast for Sister Wu. We will forever be good sisters,” Tantai Xuan grabbed on Yu Ruyan’s hand and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>With this word, things had been made very clear. Both Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan looked at Yehuang Guwu with a smile.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu shot a gaze at Qing Shui. But Qing Shui only smiled and remained silent. Despite this, he was still trying to motivate her with his eyes. By now, both him and Yehuang Guwu were almost no different from husband and wife. But if she happened to really hold up her wine cup, it would mean that she had confirmed her status.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu held up her wine cup, “Ruyan, Xuan`Er, we will forever be sisters!”</p>
 <p>After the three finished drinking their wine, Qing Shui also spent some time drinking alone with Yehuang Guwu before doing the same with Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan. Just like this, eating and drinking, half a day had passed. They talked about a lot of stuff and from then, they become even closer with each other.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui started performing Constitution Nurturing on the two girls. The two girls who broke through could also use the One-Yang Pill and Two-Yang Pill. Prior to this, the two girls had already achieved the State Master Grade. The condition to consume One-Yang Pill was also that the person taking in the pill must have strength above that of a Grade One State Master.</p>
 <p>Ever since the two girls came out from their seclusion, they had already achieved strength equal to Grade Two State Masters. With the combination of Qing Shui’s Constitution Nurturing, Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling as well as Shield Attack, it aided the girls to immediately break through the toughest stage of achieving one Sun of strength. Most importantly, the foundation of the two girls received a significant boost. This was the largest effect of Constitution Nurturing, it could help make the two girls’ pace of improving their strength increase by a few or possibly even ten times.</p>
 <p>Taking in both the One-Yang Pill and Two-Yang Pill could immediately help raise their strength up to five sun. Only one One-Yang Pill and Two-Yang Pill could be taken per year. Furthermore, a person could very likely only take at maximum ten of each of all the varieties of the Yang Pills. Hence, Qing Shui was really looking forward to refining Three-Yang Pills and the pills which came after that. This way, it would be very easy for Qing Shui to accomodate the people around him.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu had also used it. Even though to Yehuang Guwu, three sun of strength wasn’t really worth anything. But despite how small a mosquito was, it still had flesh. Let alone Qing Shui was going to be able to refine them very soon. By then, he would no longer run short of them. For pills like the One-Yang and Two-Yang Pills, they didn’t only do things as simple as merely helping to boost strength. It could also help raise some of the consumer’s body physique. This was the ability of good medicinal pills.</p>
 <p>But after Yehuang Guwu used it, she realized that the One-Yang pill actually increased her strength by two sun. After that, she consumed the Two-Yang Pill only to realize that the amount of strength increased was worth four sun. After thinking for a while, the only assumption Qing Shui could come up with was that this had to do with her body physique.</p>
 <p>It was likely that her body belonged to the cold-attribute. She needed this kind of Yang Force more than anyone else. Hence, upon absorbing them, she could achieve twice the effect with only half the work. How about if it was higher grades of Yang Pill? Now, Qing Shui really wanted to know if Three-Yang Pill would really increase strength by three sun. How about Four-Yang Pill? Normally, an unforeseen event would occur with Four-Yang Pill. For all he knew, he might end up increasing his strength by more than four sun.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the possibility was very large. Or else, the Nine Yang Pharmacopoeia could work as well.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do you have even higher grades of Yang Pill?? Yehuang Guwu looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
 <p>“I do, it’s just that I haven’t refined them. I am not sure whether I will be able to succeed in refining them. There is a limitation in amount to which I can make these things.”</p>
 <p>“I have a medical prescription here which will definitely pique your interest,” Yehuang Guwu said after thinking a bit.</p>
 <p>“Oh, what medical prescription?” Even though Qing Shui was happy, he didn’t feel all that happy. Usually, things such as medical prescriptions weren’t that appealing to him.</p>
 <p>“You don’t seem to be excited. The medical prescription is used to make dowries. Seeing that you seem not to like it, I think I will just keep it for myself!” Yehuang Guwu pouted and smiled.</p>
 <p>Especially when a mature and charming woman showed this kind of expression, it would give people the urge to commit crimes. Qing Shui held her hand and immediately slapped her well-rounded butt. A sharp and clear noise came through. Even though it wasn’t painful, it made Yehuang Guwu feel extremely embarrassed.</p>
 <p>The reason being that both Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan were present.</p>
 <p>The two girls on the other hand, were laughing very happily. There was even a bright luster in their eyes. This was the first time they saw this demonically beautiful woman at an disadvantage. Even Yu Ruyan felt insignificant in front of Yehuang Guwu. Her mature charm and beauty could only cause Yu Ruyan to sigh at her own inferiority.</p>
 <p>In Tantai Xuan’s and Yu Ruyan’s perspective, Yehuang Guwu was always the proud and elegant woman no matter whom she stood in front of. But to their surprise, it only took such a short while for them to spectate a scene where she got slapped on the ass by a man.</p>
 <p>“You damned brat, leave some face for me when you are in front of them……” Yehuang Guwu rolled her eyes at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“We are a family now. Here, hand over the medical prescription to your husband to let him analyze it.” Qing Shui stretched out his head and kissed her cheek.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu quickly gave Qing Shui the medical prescription. After that, she stepped back. She was well aware that any reasoning was absolutely unnecessary between him and her. She could only embarrass herself even more and make a joke out of herself in front of the two girls. In actuality, she wasn’t afraid of letting the girls see her, they were already sisters, what else could they not share between each other?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took it over with a smile. He was stunned upon seeing it. The paper of the medical prescription was very weird. It should be something which was passed down from a long time ago. It looked very old yet there wasn’t even the slightest scratch on it. The name of the medical prescription was also really bizarre.</p>
 <p>Double Portion Medication!!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the medicinal herbs on the medical prescription only to notice that he didn’t actually need very precious herbs. It was just that they came in a lot of varieties. Not only that but the majority of them were those which helped to unlock one’s potential. One of them was the Single Taste Constitution Origin Herb. It was also one of the most precious ones among them. Nevertheless, Qing Shui had this herb in his realm. The herb was also already very old in terms of its years. They were the herbs which was planted a long, long time ago. Now, the herb was already very huge. In fact, he was starting to get upset with the uses of these herbs. Only a little of them was used when he was refining Constitution Nurturing Pill and Tiger Bone Soup.</p>
 <p>Who would have thought for things to take such a good turn? These herbs were finally useful. In fact, it was the herb with the most efficient use. The reason being that he saw the effect of the medical prescription.</p>
 <p>Effect: Reduce the resistance against medicinal pills by half.</p>
 <p>That would mean that he could consume more effect via medicinal pills than before. For example, prior to this, he was only able to consume ten One-Yang Pill. Now, after the calculations, it basically meant that he could consume twenty of them. He used to only be able to take in one per year. Now, he could take two per year.</p>
