 <p><strong>AST 1177 - Junior Competition, Yan Jinyu's Siblings, Clan Legacy</strong></p>
 <p>"Don't worry, if he doesn't even dare to compete in this, how could they possible dare to fight for Yan City with us? Although old men like us from both clans are a form of security, great clans value the future of their clans more and the legacy amongst the younger generation." The old man smiled and said with certainty.</p>
 <p>"There's a few youngsters in Yu Clan who are especially outstanding. I wonder if fighting a Junior Competition will be advantageous to us." Yan Dingtian was still a little worried.</p>
 <p>"After you head back, go have a discussion with the others about this and select the people who will be taking part. This isn't the first time we're doing this with others. Yan Clan's younger generation is still quite strong." The old man didn't seem to be very concerned.</p>
 <p>"Alright Grandfather. I'll head back and see to the necessary preparations."</p>
 <p>"Go on. I'll make a trip to Yu Clan."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>By the time Yan Jinyu got Qing Shui his accommodation, the sun had already risen. After they had some food, Yan Jinyu told Qing Shui to get some rest and headed out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very bored. He was still thinking about the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm. Therefore, he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal directly. He wanted to familiarize himself with the control of this powerful battle technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had also put aside the Vajra Frenzied Devilish Rod Technique recently. His cultivation had increased a lot recently and the prowess of this battle technique should also have increased by a lot. This was considered one of the more powerful battle techniques that he could perform.</p>
 <p>Standing in midair in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui raised his arm, creating a series of golden Buddha palm prints. Seven giant golden Buddha palm prints appeared in the air as if they were physical hands, as if they were a line of production, glimmering in golden light. Fluorescent light flowed through it with an indescribable sense of astonishment.</p>
 <p>A majestic and dignified aura was exuded. There was also an indestructible power which was strong and domineering but yet benevolent and gentle. They seemed to strangely combine together perfectly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved his hand and streams of thoughts appeared in his mind and he followed his heart. The formed lotus shape could confine and he struck out the impactful attack in a straight line. The seven palms joined as one coming down from the top, attacking with the force that could blot out the skies with just the lift of a hand. The prowess was extremely domineering.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui performed the seven waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palm excitedly in midair. It felt very good and his mastery increased, bringing up the prowess increasingly as well. Practice makes perfect. An increase in the level of a skill could increase the prowess by a lot.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out the Nine Continents Mountain and controlled it together. Heart follows intent, seven palms as one, blotting out the skies!</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui landed the extremely domineering palm onto the Nine Continents Mountain. In that instant, Qing Shui felt that the prowess of the Nine Continents Mountain once again became extremely terrifying and was now beyond Qing Shui's imagination.</p>
 <p>"I wonder if the impact of the Nine Continents Mountain, combined with this "One Hand Cover Sky" will be able to breakthrough the second form of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation of that Yang Clan's old man?" Qing Shui wondered if he could use this method to settle the battle if he were to once again meet someone of that level.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then controlled the lotus-shaped seven waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palm, controlled the Nine Continents Mountain with his mind, while he attempted to try to create another seven waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palm with his other hand.</p>
 <p>One Hand Cover Sky!</p>
 <p>What made Qing Shui happy was that his spirit energy was sufficient. Although he was lacking in fluency in his control, it wasn't very hard. He now knew that he had gotten himself another killer move or two. His prowess had soared.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then performed the Diamond Buddha Devil Staff. Right now, he was only able to perform up to the fourth staff.</p>
 <p>Diamond Buddha Devil Staff, Fourth Staff, Five Soaring Waves!</p>
 <p>However, its prowess was even more powerful than before. It was as if he could turn the sea over with just one staff attack.</p>
 <p>Time passed as he cultivated and his abilities were starting to stabilize and slowly raise. Although Qing Shui personally felt that it was slow, outsiders would definitely find it terrifying if they were to see it for themselves. Of course, one reason was also because he had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Even if a person's aptitude wasn't fantastic, if they were to have a treasure like the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, they'd be able to stand at the very top. Moreover, Qing Shui had inherited the legacy of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui came out, it was about afternoon. When he walked out from the door, he saw that Yan Yangzhao had came back and was chatting with Yan Jinyu at the pavilion downstairs.</p>
 <p>When Yan Yangzhao saw Qing Shui, he appeared especially excited, "Younger Brother, you're finally here. I hadn't expected that you got along so well with my young sister. It's good that we're all one family now."</p>
 <p>"Brother, when did you come back? I was cultivating earlier and hadn't heard that you guys had came back." Qing Shui knew that they must have looked for him earlier but hadn't called out. However, he could still tell.</p>
 <p>"I've only just came back. Come, father has readied a feast. We need to thank you for saving Jinyu." Yan Jinyu grabbed Qing Shui and headed off while Yan Jinyu smiled and followed after.</p>
 <p>"Sister Yan, is there a solution for the matter with Yu Clan?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and asked. Although he didn't concern himself in other people's family matters, he knew about this and if he were to ask, it would just show his concern.</p>
 <p>"Father said that it's likely that we'll have a Junior Competition to decide on the problems between both clans," Yan Yangzhao said as they walked.</p>
 <p>"Junior Competition? What's that?" Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"There'll be a competition between the younger generation of Yu Clan and Yan Clan. There'll be nine rounds in total. The losing side will swear on the royal family that they'll retreat into seclusion, not come out for 1,000 years and not participate in the fights in the world." Yan Yangzhao smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He found such promises strange. However, Qing Shui felt that compared to the oaths people from his previously life that threatened to get themselves struck by lightning and such, this was more effective. It was because their promise would spread throughout Yan City's inner city and even possibly to the royal family. If it was sworn in the name of the royal family, it would be out of respect to the royal family. However, if one didn't keep to their promise after losing, it would be a blatant contempt toward the royal family. Since they were weaker than the royal family, no one would dare to go against their words like this.</p>
 <p>"This oath is good. Has it been decided when it'll be? Right, will the two of you be participating?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"The time hasn't been decided. Jinyu will definitely participate. The younger generation cannot exceed 100 years old. I'll probably not participate. The weapon you forged for Jinyu is very powerful. In the past, I was still showing off before her but now I'm being ridiculed by her all the time," Yan Yangzhao smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"The realm the cultivator is at is very important and so is one's strength. Although the weapon is very important, it doesn't mean that a powerful weapon will be able to change the results of the battle every single time." Qing Shui recalled that old man's terrifying speed, battle technique, experience and the realm he was at. All these had given Qing Shui a deeper understanding toward cultivation.</p>
 <p>It was the same for Yan Jinyu as well. Therefore, she fully agreed with what Qing Shui was saying. Qing Shui could kill that old man, but he wasn't as strong as her. Therefore, she felt that it was due to Qing Shui's own comprehension and experience.</p>
 <p>"That's right, that's right. Father tells me that all the time as well. However, I just can't stand that temptation." Yan Yangzhao smiled awkwardly.</p>
 <p>When they reached the main hall, the place where Qing Shui had came to the first time, the feast was already prepared. There were not many people. There was Yan Dingtian and a charming mature lady who was a little like Yan Jinyu standing next to him. It should be Yan Jinyu's mother.</p>
 <p>Other than that, there were six other youngsters, four men and two ladies. All of them appeared to be very outstanding. The men had an imposing aura on them as well. Most importantly, the aura these people exuded were all even stronger than Yan Yangzhao.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangzhao was one step away to become a Grade One State Master but these people were above the level of a Grade One State Master. This the aristocrat inheritance from aristocratic clans. They shouldn't be very young. People who were in their 70s or 80s were still definitely still considered to be extremely young in the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now used to it as well. He was going to turn 40 soon. In the nine continents, even when he was back in the five continents, people tended to neglect age as well. After all, even ordinary people had a lifespan of around 150 years old. Those who led a longer lives could live to an age of close to 200 years.</p>
 <p>In the world where there was strong spiritual qi of heaven and earth, people had long lifespans and strong vitality. Therefore, they appeared young and full of vigor.</p>
 <p>The two ladies were about the same age as Yan Jinyu and were extremely outstanding both in terms of their appearances and dispositions. One of them was wearing emerald green clothes while the other was in fiery red clothes. The lady in fiery red clothes seemed to be younger. She had exquisite features, bright eyes and a beautiful nose. She looked at Qing Shui with a curious smile.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, come, come. I'll introduce you. These are all my children. Qing Shui isn't an outsider either. He is Jinyu's sworn younger brother. In the future, we'll all be family," Yan Dingtian smiled, walked over, grabbed Qing Shui's hand and said.</p>
 <p>The others didn't seem to find this strange, as if they had heard of this earlier. A tall and handsome mature man smiled and said to Qing Shui. "I'm Yan Yangchi, the eldest amongst the siblings. If you don't mind, you can call me Eldest Brother like Jinyu and the others."</p>
 <p>"Eldest Brother Yan, I've often heard Sister Yan talk about you. I finally have the chance to meet you in person." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm Yan Yangchen. If you don't mind, you can call me 2nd Brother. Of course, I'll be happy if you address me as Yan Yangchen as well. I can tell that your cultivation is good. We can have some exchange another time. I didn't expect that you'll be able to defeat a Grade Two State Master." A rough-looking guy said very forthrightly. He was the most rough amongst all of them and should have the most straightforward personality.</p>
 <p>"Hello, 2nd Brother. I like personality like yours the most. I hope that when the time comes, you'll go easy on me." Qing Shui reached out his hand and shook it with the man as he said happily.</p>
 <p>"2nd Brother, can you show some restraint? At least look for him for a spar after knowing him for a few days. You always want to spar with people when you just meet them," Yan Jinyu said speechlessly.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu wasn't old but was considered the more calm ones out of them.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm Yan Yueyin. I'm older than Jinyu. Do you want to call me elder sister? My name is very useful around in Yan City." The mature and charming lady in emerald green clothes smiled as she put out her white and beautiful hand.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and shook it. "Sister Yueyin is as beautiful as what Sister Yan has sad. If I were to encounter any problems, I'll definitely come to ask for your help."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The lady in red clothes seemed to be slightly younger than Qing Shui and was called Yan Huoyun. Although her name was strange, she was very warm and welcoming. She gladly called Qing Shui Elder Brother Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The beautiful married lady was Yan Jinyu's and Yan Yangzhao's mother. The other two men were called Yan Long and Yan Leng. Yan Long was still ok but Yan Leng was a bit cold and unsociable. However, he still politely greeted Qing Shui. It was just that his smile was a little stiff.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui, don't think too much of it. This is how my brother is like. The number of times he has smiled can be counted. He has only smiled because he's happy to meet you. Usually, there aren't many people who can make him smile. Even his fiancee doesn't get such treatment," Yan Huoyun smiled and explained to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Oh, I'm flattered!"</p>
 <p>"Since we all know each other, come, everyone, take a seat. Today we're welcoming Qing Shui and expressing our thanks to him," Yan Dingtian once again said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui joined the others and took his seat. These should be Yan Dingtian's more outstanding children.</p>
