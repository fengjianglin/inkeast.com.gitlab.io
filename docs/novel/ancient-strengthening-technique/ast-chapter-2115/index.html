Give me all of the recipes that you own and apologize. Then, I can let you go; otherwise, I will make you vanish from the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This bastard. What a true bastard,” Nuolan was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent could be seen gushing from Qing Shui’s eyes. He was staring at this Young Master Zhen. At this level, Qing Shui could kill someone with his killing intent, but Qing Shui did not want to kill him that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intense killing intent made Young Master Zhen’s legs shaky and he fell to the ground. He was as pale as a paper and his sweat was pouring like rainfall. Most importantly, a smell of ammonia came out. This Young Master Zhen was scared until he pissed in his pants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked towards this Young Master Zhen slowly. Not only Young Master Zhen, but the men around him was also lethargic and trembling even though they were not targeted by Qing Shui’s killing intent. Now, it was needless to say about their abilities to stop Qing Shui. They were practically useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did a fool like you survive until now? While the others didn’t act on me, why did you have to act like a smart-ass?” Qing Shui stared at this Young Master Zhen like watching a retard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Song regretted ten thousand times now. Now that he thought of it, it was impossible that he was the only one who knew about this profit-making place, anyone would know at first glance. The Imperial Cuisine Hall would gain a lot of attention, but it must have its own reasons to survive well until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He just wanted to prove to his family that he was not useless. He was about to inherit the leading position, but he did not seem to have even the slightest chance now. Later, he would be called a fool, a retard, and this name would follow him for his entire life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, these were not the most important things. He wondered if he could make it out of here alive and kicking. It was a great offense to a capable warrior and he deserved to be killed. He could take a warning this time if that was necessary, as his acts were a big humiliation to a strong warrior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Song thought that the target did not have any strong backers, so even if he took an obvious advantage out of it, the opponent could do nothing. Now that the opponent was an expert, his previous acts were mirroring that he was a retard. It was still fine if he was really retarded, but he was not. He did something so foolish and forced others to do everything according to his will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he met this hurdle. The opponent would never let him go after he was doing an almost robbery-like act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will give you a chance today. Kneel and break both of your legs! Get lost!” Qing Shui stood in front of him, he had no mercy towards a rubbish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Song trembled exaggeratedly, he knew he had no ways to avoid it today. Yet, he did not want to lose his legs. At this age, he had never suffered so much. He looked at Qing Shui with his terrified and pleading eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like you’re not moving. I can’t be sure that you can stand up again if I do it personally,” Qing Shui finished his words and raised his leg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll do it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Song rolled over and knelt before Qing Shui. He bowed and said to the man beside him, “Do it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Faster, do you freaking want me to die?” Zhen Song got anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man clenched and broke both of his legs. Initially, he didn’t dare to be too forceful, but that still made Zhen Song scream tragically too. Knowing that Zhen Song would suffer even more if he did not break the legs, he clenched his fists and broke them off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These men came and left hastily as if they were here so that Qing Shui could break Zhen Song’s legs. This was Qing Shui’s first time forcing someone to kneel down. However, it was mainly because of what Zhen Song said. Qing Shui never liked to force anybody to kneel. A man’s knees were precious, he could kneel before Heaven and Earth, he could kneel before his parents, but once he knelt before others, he must be in desperation. Qing Shui reckoned that he would never do that just because his life was threatened. Even if he did, his life would be ruined because of depression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps, it was normal to kneel down sometimes. If that could be a solution, it was perfect. Sometimes, it could be a waste but there was no other choice. In the past life, a great man experienced such humiliation and gained the title of a flexible and resilient man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, it was easy to kneel down; Sometimes, it was so tough that one would rather die. Qing Shui would never be able to imagine such things until such a day arose. If a person had his family members’ lives in his/her hand, would he kneel down?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui became quiet thinking about that. Things did not seem to be absolute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, the Zhen Clan is not worthy to be mentioned. We are considered strong in this Northern Emperor City and Domain. Now, the Divine Palace and Taiyi Immortal Palace are apparently the strongest. Some forces are extremely weak and will definitely lose miserably to act against them in a real battle. As for the hidden forces, nobody could tell if they are stronger than Divine Palace and Taiyi Immortal Palace. It is possible, but since they are hidden, they won’t get involved in the matters of the mortal world,” Nuolan noticed Qing Shui’s expression and thought he was worried about the Zhen Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not worried of the Zhen Clan. We have probably invited jealousy now. Previously, I was in other rural places without strong people. Yet, it is different here. I’m afraid that someone will go all the way and it will be troublesome. Besides, we have enemies too. The others don’t know that the Divine Palace is behind the Imperial Cuisine Hall, but people at our level will find out quite easily. I’m afraid that some people will use this and go against us together,” Qing Shui realized a problem suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was not the Divine Palace that was behind Qing Shui, many people wouldn’t pursue him. But knowing that he belonged to the Divine Palace, he had many enemies instantly. Friends would be happy for Qing Shui, but enemies would not. They would be dying to kill Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One would say, ‘If you could not recruit one person, you should never let others do it. Moreover, this person was already recruited by others, you certainly shouldn’t let him be.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Qing Shui was already powerful enough so he was not overly worried. However, he disliked troubles. He had no better ways too, he could only wish to find more Divine Square Cauldron and Divine Weapon Crystal. With that, his strength would be greatly improved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui said that, Nuolan looked a little different. Yet, she was back to normal very quickly. She smiled at Qing Shui, “No worries, Elder Sis will protect you. Nobody here would be bullying you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. Her tyranny, her mighty power, this alluring and charming woman was so mature. Qing Shui felt his blood raging just by looking at her. Qing Shui had a good self-control; otherwise, he would have turned into a wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuolan knew this man had a strong self-control too. Rarely did people act so casually in front of her. Many of them pretended to be polite but were only faking it. They looked awkward and their eyes became extremely offensive when she lowered her guard. They looked as if they craved to strip her clothes off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After so many days, this young man was very chill. Though he sometimes misbehaved, she felt that was more dependable than those kinds of men.</span></p>
