 <p><strong>Chapter 467 Golden Jade Rabbit, Heavenly Pellet is done!.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 467 - Golden Jade Rabbit, Heavenly Pellet is done! Getting ready</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the Stonegold Rabbit King swallowed down five Beast Pills, its power level increased significantly. It increased by fifty percent. However, there wasn’t any sign of it evolving or going through blood awakening.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright Qing Shui, I know that it’s strength will stop increasing after it takes in five pills. Let’s stop wasting these kinds of good medicines. I think it’s safe to assume that the small rabbit is no longer able to evolve any further.” Huoyun Liu-li smiled as she passed the porcelain bottle to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked back at the girl whose mouth tended to never hold back despite having a gentle and kind heart. He didn’t take the porcelain bottle. He smiled gently. “Believe me. Just feeding the small rabbit with the things in your hand will definitely make it evolve.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You can stop lying to me. Even sister’s Golden Wing Thunder Condor was unable to evolve. This rabbit has already done a good job considering that it is able to increase its cultivation strength by fifty percent.There is no point wasting such expensive stuffs,” Huoyun Liu-li chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can refine a lot of this stuff. Don't you want to let the small rabbit evolve and become more powerful?” Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-li. He knew that she wouldn't be able to resist the temptation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can you really evolve the small rabbit?” Huoyun Liu-li was moved.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked back at the naive girl, or rather, the girl who would only behave naively in front of him. He still smiled and nodded his head. Regardless of whether the Stonegold Rabbit King would break through, Qing Shui insisted on making Huoyun Liu-li feed the Stonegold Rabbit King the Beast Pill.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, what surprised Qing Shui the most was that the Stonegold Rabbit King actually evolved when it ate the fiftieth Beast Pill. Or rather, it underwent Blood Awakening. It’s just that the process didn’t look as stunning as when it happened to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. But the formidable aura that was given out still made Qing Shui and the others feel mind-boggled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s a Golden Jade Rabbit!” said Cang Wuya in amazement.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Cang Wuya who renamed the Stonegold Rabbit King as the Golden Jade Rabbit. Now that it had evolved from the Stonegold Rabbit King, not only did it not grow any bigger, its body actually shrunk instead. Its entire body was less than one foot long, its body completely colored gold, giving out a gentle golden light as bright as jade.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Its body was well proportioned. Both of its eyes revealed that it had some kind of intelligence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This reminded Qing Shui of the woman in a fairytale from his previous incarnation. The lonely woman lived in the Moon Palace. She had a jade rabbit to accompany her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Golden Jade Rabbit? Grandpa, what about the Golden Jade Rabbit?” Huoyun Liu-li asked her grandpa as she looked at the small and friendly rabbit that hopped onto her chest.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Golden Jade Rabbit is also considered to be a type of mutated beast. Across the World of the Nine Continents, there aren’t only the mutated beasts shown in the Archive of Mutated Beast. There are still a lot of them. It’s just that the majority of them are myths, for example, this Golden Jade Rabbit.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li glanced at the golden rabbit that looked much more beautiful than before and then gazed back at Cang Wuya with an expectant expression. She greatly wished that what Cang Wuya said later on would be able to satisfy her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya looked back at Huoyun Liu-li. After that, he chuckled and carried on, “Now, the Golden Jade Rabbit is already a Martial King stage Demonic Beast.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A Martial King stage Demonic Beast?” said Huoyun Liu-li in amazement. After that, she held up the small rabbit with both of her hands. She found it very hard to believe that it was a Martial King stage Demonic Beast.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Martial King stage Demonic Beasts were already really powerful. The reason this was so was that once they advanced past the Xiantian gap to reach Martial King stage, there was a huge possibility that they would reach the pinnacle of the Martial King stage as time passed. This was the kind of change brought about as a result of evolving. In the past, it was even a problem for the Stonegold Rabbit King to reach the pinnacle of Xiantian stage. To think that it would immediately turn into an early stage Martial King Demonic Beast from one evolution caused Qing Shui to suspect it to be Blood Awakening. It seemed like the Golden Jade Rabbit was also one of the powerful Demonic Beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it now has a really huge potential to grow even though it's only at the early Martial King stage.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa, what ability does the Golden Jade Rabbit possess?” Huoyun Liu-li wanted to see what kind of strength this tiny little thing possessed. All along, she had thought that this tiny little thing looked quite beautiful. Merely the thought of sending it to battle against the formidable warriors haunted her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You had better not underestimate it just because it looks gentle and powerless now. When it encounters an enemy, it's whole body will shine as bright as a diamond. Furthermore, it can have a terrifying burst of speed. It's large rabbit teeth are capable of tearing diamonds, irons, and more, making it impossible to guard against. One of the most important features of the Golden Jade Rabbit is that it will spit out a mouthful of golden mist from its mouth, which can lower the reaction speed of the warriors as well as their sight range and their spirit energy,” Cang Wuya chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then after three days, will it be of help to Qing Shui?” Huoyun Liu-li asked as she stared at Cang Wuya with a hopeful look. It seemed like this was the most essential question to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes it will, but unfortunately, it's still too small for now. Wait until it grows bigger in the future. It will turn out to be really powerful,” Cang Wuya chuckled and said without much thought.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li understood Cang Wuya’s message. She smiled reluctantly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, by then, battling against Feng Shamo with the Golden Elephant shouldn't be a problem for you. If the other members from the Feng Clan also make their move, just use the golden elephant to bind him, then we will deal with the rest of the members together. In the Feng Clan, other than Feng Shamo being the strongest, the others are just like me, hence he might surrender without you needing to kill anyone.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master, we still have to make a few more preparations just in case things don't go as well as we expected,” spoke up Fei Wuji all of a sudden after thinking for a while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Senior uncle, do you mean to say that you are afraid the Feng Clan might come up with some other bizarre tricks?” Qing Shui thought of other matters when he heard that the Golden Jade Rabbit could spit out Golden Mist just now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, the aristocratic clans would often have things up their sleeve. Normally they wouldn't use it, but at times of crisis, they wouldn't bother about it so much.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard this, he felt a bit worried. But then he remembered that he had his nature energy and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Golden Qi and Diamond Protection to defend against the negative elements.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We will accompany you to the Feng Clan by then!” Fei Wuji thought about it for a while and went on to say.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew about Fei Wuji’s intention. Undoubtedly, he had only wanted to provoke the Old Ancestor to come out and pay attention to this matter.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“By then, I'll go on my own. Have faith in me, I'll be fine!” Qing Shui deeply contemplated and concluded that it would be a disadvantage to have more people there, especially when there were a few girls.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, I want to go with you.” Huoyun Liu-li bit her lips.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Both Canghai Mingyue and Mingyue Gelou looked at Qing Shui. Even though they were silent, what they wanted to express was obvious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There are still a few days left. Let's talk about it by then!” Qing Shui said while patting her head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It doesn't matter how many days! I still want to follow you!” Huoyun Liu-li responded immediately after Qing Shui finished speaking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: “...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, cheer up everyone! It will be fine!” Qing Shui reluctantly emphasized one more time. Qing Shui comforted the three women as he gazed at their concerned expressions.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui! Are you leaving again!?” Canghai Mingyue questioned all of a sudden.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the beautiful, pure-hearted, yet cautious woman. He was aware that she had seen through the problem and understood that he was trying to establish dominance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui hadn't thought about leaving this place so early. After all, the Sword Tower hadn't been destroyed. However, Qing Shui had also considered leaving before. He had planned to visit either the Central Continent or other continents and travel around them for a few years. By the time he returned once again, destroying the Sword Tower would have become a lot easier.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was well aware that, in order to leave this time, he would have to establish dominance. In fact, he needed to establish it firmly. Unfortunately, the Feng Clan managed to catch up in time. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to first start with setting the Feng Clan as his target. No matter how he thought about it, he still believed that there wouldn't be any other alternatives as good as starting with the Feng Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even heading to Flowerfruit Mountain to look for the treasures listed on the treasure map would be a hard task. Undeniably, there were a lot of people who wanted to murder him. But now, Qing Shui was no longer afraid. With his current strength, including that of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he would surpass a lot of people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Interestingly, Qing Shui realized that he had already reached a considerably high position. He even held a seat at the top of the pyramid in Green Cloud Continent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">***</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the blink of an eye, a day passed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually operated his qi according to the “Heavenly Pellet” method. The sticky golden component within the Heavenly Province had already taken the shape of a sphere. It gradually revolved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With all of his attention, Qing Shui immersed himself deep into the revolving “Heavenly Pellet.” The vacant space in the middle became smaller and smaller. Qing Shui was well aware that the Heavenly Pellet would be considered done as soon as it condensed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Five days had already passed inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Within those five days, Qing Shui didn't move an inch. He didn't eat and sleep. He only sat down there with his legs crossed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui felt very tired, he still pushed himself forward. This was all the strength of his conviction. Qing Shui had wanted to lay down and rest really badly, but he knew that he couldn't. Otherwise, all of his hard work would have been for naught. The next time he did it, he would still have to exhaust himself as much as this time, so much so that he might suffer even more!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Soon, soon!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clenched his teeth as he struggled to hold on. After that, he slowly operated the Heavenly Pellet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Pellet within the Heavenly province began to emit a golden light. The speed at which it spun also became faster and faster. However, the Heavenly Pellet that was originally the size of a pigeon egg was slowly shrinking.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though it was shrinking, it shone brighter and looked more and more lively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ka!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a soft, crunchy noise which sounded just like when a faulty and disarranged part got adjusted back in place. In that instant, the Heavenly Pellet which was only the size of a grape gave out a dazzling golden light. An overwhelming power emerged from the Heavenly Province and instantly spread around his entire body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A long time passed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly opened his eyes. He wore a jubilant expression. His clear eyes made people felt deeply refreshed. It looked unusually good.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It's done!” Qing Shui whispered in joy. After cultivating for a long period of time, the Heavenly Pellet finally took shape. As Qing Shui looked at the Heavenly Pellet which was the size of a grape inside the Heavenly Province, Qing Shui felt exceptionally satisfied.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he felt the power inside his body, he realized that his body had achieved a tremendous power level, as much as 12.5 million.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui were to include the Heavenly Thunder Slash, Frenzied Bull’s Strength, Diamond Qi, Nature Energy, Big Dipper Sword, and his Godly Force Talisman, Qing Shui would have achieved a strength which was worth four countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought over it for a while and felt that he had improved a lot, especially compared to his previous self. Qing Shui felt confident that he would be able to defeat warriors with strengths of four countries if he were to run into them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Let alone the fact that he still possessed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant which was like a war fortress.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The technique that Qing Shui originally cultivated was precisely the technique which involved the physical body. The strength that his physical body possessed was a few times more powerful than that of the warriors’ at the same stage as him. This was because Qing Shui was capable of resisting heavy attacks. Furthermore, he also possessed the regeneration ability which was even more terrifying, and the strength of his organs also exceeded the warriors that were at the same stage as him by severalfold.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This Ancient Strengthening Technique was different from the usual cultivating method.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Let alone that both the Divine Arm and Divine Feet Clearing were already in their perfect state. Both of his legs and feet had achieved a terrifying level of strength. He could fully utilize his strength without needing to worry about injuring himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was already early morning now. Tomorrow was the day when he was supposed to go to the Feng Clan. The Heavenly Pellet that Qing Shui cultivated made him more confident. Furthermore, Qing Shui was also concerned about why the Feng Clan hadn’t made their move.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he thought about this problem, Qing Shui felt a bit surprised. He thought that the Feng Clan would come looking for him very soon. But now, what Qing Shui more strongly believed was that they saw him as insignificant. Did they really want to see how Qing Shui was going to trample on the Feng Clan that badly?&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were all waiting for Qing Shui. In fact, why would they want to show other people that the Feng Clan had a low tolerance?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of this was no longer important. Qing Shui had already decided to do it his way. Besides, the Feng Clan had a really bad reputation. The Starmoon Hall was even more harsh when it came to accusing the Feng Clan. Each and every one of the female disciples would grit their teeth whenever they talked about the Feng Clan. A lot of female disciples were like Yan Ling’er, who had neither power nor influence, having been humiliated by the people from Feng Clan before. They were furious, but they didn’t dare say anything. The only thing they could do was hold it in quietly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No one wanted the Feng Clan to be the most dominant clan in Starmoon Hall. No matter which sect it was, there would always be things like this happening. There were now almost two million people in just Starmoon Hall. This kind of thing was actually normal. Besides, not many people could take the pressure of being both bribed and threatened unless they had enough strength to instill fear in their opponents.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">***</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master, you have got to back me up! I have only Yun Yang as my child. Yun Yang died, but that Qing Shui is still alive!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A married woman who looked considerably beautiful weeped endlessly as she talked to the old man.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Xin Yuan, I am Yun Yang’s grandpa. Yun Yang’s death has made me more mournful than anyone else. It goes without saying that I would bring that brat over and bury him beside Yun Yang.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t want just that brat to be buried next to him. I even plan on doing the same thing to the women around him, oh, and that Yan Ling’er as well,” said the beautiful woman with resentment as she wiped her tears away.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“For now, I won’t make my move yet. He will come on his own soon. The Feng Clan’s pride doesn’t allow anyone to provoke others. Yun Yang is my grandson. I will naturally be troubled and disturbed. Besides, Sha Hong has also died. He was also one of my sons who would have the most achievements in the future,” Feng Zhixing said in sorrow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Xing Chen is your son. Then is Yun Yang not your son?” The beautiful woman said indignantly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What did you say?” Feng Zhixing looked at the beautiful wife in shock.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you still not clear about what you have done? Within that one whole month, you were the only one who had sex with me! You don’t even have a clue as to whose belly your son was in! Tell me, whose son is Yun Yang?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Zhixing became silent. He didn’t have too many feelings about it. So what if Yun Yang had been his son, or his grandson. He still had more than ten sons and grandsons. It no longer mattered to him much about whether he would have one more or one less grandson.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Humans were really strange. For someone like Cang Wuya whose son had passed away and who was yet to have any grandsons, he cared more about familial love. Even after they had reached such an age, they still found it difficult to let go.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But an old man like Feng Zhixing was brought up in an influential clan. Since he was young, he and his brothers had always been locked in constant strife, so much so that they wouldn’t hesitate to kill their own blood-related siblings. For the man who grew up in an environment where familial love was nothing, authority and money were instead the most important thing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of the influential clans had chaotic lives. To an influential clan, the incident that had happened to Feng Zhixing and his children and wife wasn’t even worth mentioning, especially to a woman whose husband died upon marrying into an influential family. It would be slightly better if they had children. Those who didn’t would meet miserable ends.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like Yu He. If Yu Donghao hadn’t recovered his strength, even a clan with Xiantian Warriors would encounter this kind of problem. In Cang Lang Country, a clan that had Xiantian Warriors was indeed considered a formidable clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Your son died very early. Now that Yun Yang has also passed away, how do you expect me to continue living?” The beautiful wife grieved in sorrow.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The person is already dead. There is no point in weeping any longer. We will just wait for the Grand Ancestor to come back,” Feng Zhixing snorted while knitting his brows.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 467 - Golden Jade Rabbit, Heavenly Pellet is done! Getting ready</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the Stonegold Rabbit King swallowed down five Beast Pills, its power level increased significantly. It increased by fifty percent. However, there wasn’t any sign of it evolving or going through blood awakening.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright Qing Shui, I know that it’s strength will stop increasing after it takes in five pills. Let’s stop wasting these kinds of good medicines. I think it’s safe to assume that the small rabbit is no longer able to evolve any further.” Huoyun Liu-li smiled as she passed the porcelain bottle to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked back at the girl whose mouth tended to never hold back despite having a gentle and kind heart. He didn’t take the porcelain bottle. He smiled gently. “Believe me. Just feeding the small rabbit with the things in your hand will definitely make it evolve.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You can stop lying to me. Even sister’s Golden Wing Thunder Condor was unable to evolve. This rabbit has already done a good job considering that it is able to increase its cultivation strength by fifty percent.There is no point wasting such expensive stuffs,” Huoyun Liu-li chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can refine a lot of this stuff. Don't you want to let the small rabbit evolve and become more powerful?” Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-li. He knew that she wouldn't be able to resist the temptation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can you really evolve the small rabbit?” Huoyun Liu-li was moved.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked back at the naive girl, or rather, the girl who would only behave naively in front of him. He still smiled and nodded his head. Regardless of whether the Stonegold Rabbit King would break through, Qing Shui insisted on making Huoyun Liu-li feed the Stonegold Rabbit King the Beast Pill.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, what surprised Qing Shui the most was that the Stonegold Rabbit King actually evolved when it ate the fiftieth Beast Pill. Or rather, it underwent Blood Awakening. It’s just that the process didn’t look as stunning as when it happened to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. But the formidable aura that was given out still made Qing Shui and the others feel mind-boggled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s a Golden Jade Rabbit!” said Cang Wuya in amazement.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Cang Wuya who renamed the Stonegold Rabbit King as the Golden Jade Rabbit. Now that it had evolved from the Stonegold Rabbit King, not only did it not grow any bigger, its body actually shrunk instead. Its entire body was less than one foot long, its body completely colored gold, giving out a gentle golden light as bright as jade.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Its body was well proportioned. Both of its eyes revealed that it had some kind of intelligence.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This reminded Qing Shui of the woman in a fairytale from his previous incarnation. The lonely woman lived in the Moon Palace. She had a jade rabbit to accompany her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Golden Jade Rabbit? Grandpa, what about the Golden Jade Rabbit?” Huoyun Liu-li asked her grandpa as she looked at the small and friendly rabbit that hopped onto her chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Golden Jade Rabbit is also considered to be a type of mutated beast. Across the World of the Nine Continents, there aren’t only the mutated beasts shown in the Archive of Mutated Beast. There are still a lot of them. It’s just that the majority of them are myths, for example, this Golden Jade Rabbit.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li glanced at the golden rabbit that looked much more beautiful than before and then gazed back at Cang Wuya with an expectant expression. She greatly wished that what Cang Wuya said later on would be able to satisfy her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya looked back at Huoyun Liu-li. After that, he chuckled and carried on, “Now, the Golden Jade Rabbit is already a Martial King stage Demonic Beast.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A Martial King stage Demonic Beast?” said Huoyun Liu-li in amazement. After that, she held up the small rabbit with both of her hands. She found it very hard to believe that it was a Martial King stage Demonic Beast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Martial King stage Demonic Beasts were already really powerful. The reason this was so was that once they advanced past the Xiantian gap to reach Martial King stage, there was a huge possibility that they would reach the pinnacle of the Martial King stage as time passed. This was the kind of change brought about as a result of evolving. In the past, it was even a problem for the Stonegold Rabbit King to reach the pinnacle of Xiantian stage. To think that it would immediately turn into an early stage Martial King Demonic Beast from one evolution caused Qing Shui to suspect it to be Blood Awakening. It seemed like the Golden Jade Rabbit was also one of the powerful Demonic Beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it now has a really huge potential to grow even though it's only at the early Martial King stage.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa, what ability does the Golden Jade Rabbit possess?” Huoyun Liu-li wanted to see what kind of strength this tiny little thing possessed. All along, she had thought that this tiny little thing looked quite beautiful. Merely the thought of sending it to battle against the formidable warriors haunted her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You had better not underestimate it just because it looks gentle and powerless now. When it encounters an enemy, it's whole body will shine as bright as a diamond. Furthermore, it can have a terrifying burst of speed. It's large rabbit teeth are capable of tearing diamonds, irons, and more, making it impossible to guard against. One of the most important features of the Golden Jade Rabbit is that it will spit out a mouthful of golden mist from its mouth, which can lower the reaction speed of the warriors as well as their sight range and their spirit energy,” Cang Wuya chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then after three days, will it be of help to Qing Shui?” Huoyun Liu-li asked as she stared at Cang Wuya with a hopeful look. It seemed like this was the most essential question to her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes it will, but unfortunately, it's still too small for now. Wait until it grows bigger in the future. It will turn out to be really powerful,” Cang Wuya chuckled and said without much thought.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li understood Cang Wuya’s message. She smiled reluctantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, by then, battling against Feng Shamo with the Golden Elephant shouldn't be a problem for you. If the other members from the Feng Clan also make their move, just use the golden elephant to bind him, then we will deal with the rest of the members together. In the Feng Clan, other than Feng Shamo being the strongest, the others are just like me, hence he might surrender without you needing to kill anyone.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master, we still have to make a few more preparations just in case things don't go as well as we expected,” spoke up Fei Wuji all of a sudden after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Senior uncle, do you mean to say that you are afraid the Feng Clan might come up with some other bizarre tricks?” Qing Shui thought of other matters when he heard that the Golden Jade Rabbit could spit out Golden Mist just now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, the aristocratic clans would often have things up their sleeve. Normally they wouldn't use it, but at times of crisis, they wouldn't bother about it so much.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard this, he felt a bit worried. But then he remembered that he had his nature energy and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Golden Qi and Diamond Protection to defend against the negative elements.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We will accompany you to the Feng Clan by then!” Fei Wuji thought about it for a while and went on to say.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew about Fei Wuji’s intention. Undoubtedly, he had only wanted to provoke the Old Ancestor to come out and pay attention to this matter.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“By then, I'll go on my own. Have faith in me, I'll be fine!” Qing Shui deeply contemplated and concluded that it would be a disadvantage to have more people there, especially when there were a few girls.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, I want to go with you.” Huoyun Liu-li bit her lips.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Both Canghai Mingyue and Mingyue Gelou looked at Qing Shui. Even though they were silent, what they wanted to express was obvious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There are still a few days left. Let's talk about it by then!” Qing Shui said while patting her head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It doesn't matter how many days! I still want to follow you!” Huoyun Liu-li responded immediately after Qing Shui finished speaking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: “...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, cheer up everyone! It will be fine!” Qing Shui reluctantly emphasized one more time. Qing Shui comforted the three women as he gazed at their concerned expressions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui! Are you leaving again!?” Canghai Mingyue questioned all of a sudden.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the beautiful, pure-hearted, yet cautious woman. He was aware that she had seen through the problem and understood that he was trying to establish dominance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui hadn't thought about leaving this place so early. After all, the Sword Tower hadn't been destroyed. However, Qing Shui had also considered leaving before. He had planned to visit either the Central Continent or other continents and travel around them for a few years. By the time he returned once again, destroying the Sword Tower would have become a lot easier.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was well aware that, in order to leave this time, he would have to establish dominance. In fact, he needed to establish it firmly. Unfortunately, the Feng Clan managed to catch up in time. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to first start with setting the Feng Clan as his target. No matter how he thought about it, he still believed that there wouldn't be any other alternatives as good as starting with the Feng Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even heading to Flowerfruit Mountain to look for the treasures listed on the treasure map would be a hard task. Undeniably, there were a lot of people who wanted to murder him. But now, Qing Shui was no longer afraid. With his current strength, including that of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he would surpass a lot of people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Interestingly, Qing Shui realized that he had already reached a considerably high position. He even held a seat at the top of the pyramid in Green Cloud Continent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">***</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the blink of an eye, a day passed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually operated his qi according to the “Heavenly Pellet” method. The sticky golden component within the Heavenly Province had already taken the shape of a sphere. It gradually revolved.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With all of his attention, Qing Shui immersed himself deep into the revolving “Heavenly Pellet.” The vacant space in the middle became smaller and smaller. Qing Shui was well aware that the Heavenly Pellet would be considered done as soon as it condensed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Five days had already passed inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Within those five days, Qing Shui didn't move an inch. He didn't eat and sleep. He only sat down there with his legs crossed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui felt very tired, he still pushed himself forward. This was all the strength of his conviction. Qing Shui had wanted to lay down and rest really badly, but he knew that he couldn't. Otherwise, all of his hard work would have been for naught. The next time he did it, he would still have to exhaust himself as much as this time, so much so that he might suffer even more!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Soon, soon!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clenched his teeth as he struggled to hold on. After that, he slowly operated the Heavenly Pellet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Pellet within the Heavenly province began to emit a golden light. The speed at which it spun also became faster and faster. However, the Heavenly Pellet that was originally the size of a pigeon egg was slowly shrinking.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though it was shrinking, it shone brighter and looked more and more lively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ka!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a soft, crunchy noise which sounded just like when a faulty and disarranged part got adjusted back in place. In that instant, the Heavenly Pellet which was only the size of a grape gave out a dazzling golden light. An overwhelming power emerged from the Heavenly Province and instantly spread around his entire body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A long time passed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly opened his eyes. He wore a jubilant expression. His clear eyes made people felt deeply refreshed. It looked unusually good.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It's done!” Qing Shui whispered in joy. After cultivating for a long period of time, the Heavenly Pellet finally took shape. As Qing Shui looked at the Heavenly Pellet which was the size of a grape inside the Heavenly Province, Qing Shui felt exceptionally satisfied.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he felt the power inside his body, he realized that his body had achieved a tremendous power level, as much as 12.5 million.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui were to include the Heavenly Thunder Slash, Frenzied Bull’s Strength, Diamond Qi, Nature Energy, Big Dipper Sword, and his Godly Force Talisman, Qing Shui would have achieved a strength which was worth four countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought over it for a while and felt that he had improved a lot, especially compared to his previous self. Qing Shui felt confident that he would be able to defeat warriors with strengths of four countries if he were to run into them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Let alone the fact that he still possessed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant which was like a war fortress.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The technique that Qing Shui originally cultivated was precisely the technique which involved the physical body. The strength that his physical body possessed was a few times more powerful than that of the warriors’ at the same stage as him. This was because Qing Shui was capable of resisting heavy attacks. Furthermore, he also possessed the regeneration ability which was even more terrifying, and the strength of his organs also exceeded the warriors that were at the same stage as him by severalfold.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This Ancient Strengthening Technique was different from the usual cultivating method.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Let alone that both the Divine Arm and Divine Feet Clearing were already in their perfect state. Both of his legs and feet had achieved a terrifying level of strength. He could fully utilize his strength without needing to worry about injuring himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was already early morning now. Tomorrow was the day when he was supposed to go to the Feng Clan. The Heavenly Pellet that Qing Shui cultivated made him more confident. Furthermore, Qing Shui was also concerned about why the Feng Clan hadn’t made their move.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he thought about this problem, Qing Shui felt a bit surprised. He thought that the Feng Clan would come looking for him very soon. But now, what Qing Shui more strongly believed was that they saw him as insignificant. Did they really want to see how Qing Shui was going to trample on the Feng Clan that badly?&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were all waiting for Qing Shui. In fact, why would they want to show other people that the Feng Clan had a low tolerance?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of this was no longer important. Qing Shui had already decided to do it his way. Besides, the Feng Clan had a really bad reputation. The Starmoon Hall was even more harsh when it came to accusing the Feng Clan. Each and every one of the female disciples would grit their teeth whenever they talked about the Feng Clan. A lot of female disciples were like Yan Ling’er, who had neither power nor influence, having been humiliated by the people from Feng Clan before. They were furious, but they didn’t dare say anything. The only thing they could do was hold it in quietly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No one wanted the Feng Clan to be the most dominant clan in Starmoon Hall. No matter which sect it was, there would always be things like this happening. There were now almost two million people in just Starmoon Hall. This kind of thing was actually normal. Besides, not many people could take the pressure of being both bribed and threatened unless they had enough strength to instill fear in their opponents.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">***</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master, you have got to back me up! I have only Yun Yang as my child. Yun Yang died, but that Qing Shui is still alive!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A married woman who looked considerably beautiful weeped endlessly as she talked to the old man.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Xin Yuan, I am Yun Yang’s grandpa. Yun Yang’s death has made me more mournful than anyone else. It goes without saying that I would bring that brat over and bury him beside Yun Yang.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I don’t want just that brat to be buried next to him. I even plan on doing the same thing to the women around him, oh, and that Yan Ling’er as well,” said the beautiful woman with resentment as she wiped her tears away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“For now, I won’t make my move yet. He will come on his own soon. The Feng Clan’s pride doesn’t allow anyone to provoke others. Yun Yang is my grandson. I will naturally be troubled and disturbed. Besides, Sha Hong has also died. He was also one of my sons who would have the most achievements in the future,” Feng Zhixing said in sorrow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Xing Chen is your son. Then is Yun Yang not your son?” The beautiful woman said indignantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What did you say?” Feng Zhixing looked at the beautiful wife in shock.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you still not clear about what you have done? Within that one whole month, you were the only one who had sex with me! You don’t even have a clue as to whose belly your son was in! Tell me, whose son is Yun Yang?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Zhixing became silent. He didn’t have too many feelings about it. So what if Yun Yang had been his son, or his grandson. He still had more than ten sons and grandsons. It no longer mattered to him much about whether he would have one more or one less grandson.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Humans were really strange. For someone like Cang Wuya whose son had passed away and who was yet to have any grandsons, he cared more about familial love. Even after they had reached such an age, they still found it difficult to let go.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But an old man like Feng Zhixing was brought up in an influential clan. Since he was young, he and his brothers had always been locked in constant strife, so much so that they wouldn’t hesitate to kill their own blood-related siblings. For the man who grew up in an environment where familial love was nothing, authority and money were instead the most important thing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A lot of the influential clans had chaotic lives. To an influential clan, the incident that had happened to Feng Zhixing and his children and wife wasn’t even worth mentioning, especially to a woman whose husband died upon marrying into an influential family. It would be slightly better if they had children. Those who didn’t would meet miserable ends.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“Your son died very early. Now that Yun Yang has also passed away, how do you expect me to continue living?” The beautiful wife grieved in sorrow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The person is already dead. There is no point in weeping any longer. We will just wait for the Grand Ancestor to come back,” Feng Zhixing snorted while knitting his brows.&nbsp;</p>
