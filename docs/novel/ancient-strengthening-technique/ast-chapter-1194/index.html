 <p><strong>AST 1194 - Nine Yang Gold Needle Acupuncture. Taichi Pernicious Aura</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and shook his head, rejecting Yan Jinyu’s good intentions. “This place is quite close to the Yan Clan. Besides, they wouldn’t dare to attack in public. It will be fine.”</p>
 <p>After what had happened yesterday night, Qing Shui was quite confident in himself and wasn’t concerned at all.</p>
 <p>“The royal family has already stepped forward. I can assure you that at the very least, no one would try to endanger Mister Qing over this matter.” the Fourth Prince smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Fourth Prince, “I sincerely thank you then!”</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui wanted to head for the outside world through the royal family or maybe through the Heaven Secret Academy by relying on the royal family, he wasn’t used to flattering others. He liked to rise with his own strength to at least be on the same level as others.</p>
 <p>It could also be said that anyone would prefer it that way. But only very few would actually pull it off. However, Qing Shui had both the capital and the potential. The only thing he needed was more time.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to stand on ceremony. You are a friend of the Yan Clan. I have already taken Mister Qing as a friend too.” the Fourth Prince smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Of course, I’m also very happy to be able to be friends with the Fourth Prince.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Fourth Prince and the others only left after staying for more than half a day. They came today mainly to invite Qing Shui to a feast the Yan Clan was organizing to thank him. They wanted to see if he would be available tomorrow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had more than enough time. In any case, he would have squeezed out time for it even if he was busy. Hence, he naturally agreed. Additionally, preparations for Yan Yangchi’s and Fifth Princess’s marriage had already started. Many people within Yan City already knew about it.</p>
 <p>The Yan Clan’s position within Yan City would rise once they were related by marriage. Most importantly, the royal family would send people over to share the burden of fighting against Scarlet Flame Region. This would help make things more relaxed for the Yan Clan.</p>
 <p>Mentioning the Scarlet Flame Region, he remembered that there was news these few days about the Scarlet Flame Region being on the move again. Some of the huge clans in Yan City had shared that a few of their people had been injured. Unfortunately, the only thing they could do was defend themselves. They were unable to take the initiative to attack. This made people feel upset.</p>
 <p>Today, Yan Yangchi and the others had also mentioned the warriors from Scarlet Flame Region. They even told the public that they would make blood flow like a river on the wedding day of the Yan Clan and the royal family.</p>
 <p>They weren’t specify whose blood they wanted to shed like water. Was it the Yan Clan? Or people from Yan City? Or was it certain warriors? Actually, the people from Scarlet Flame Region have done quite a lot of these things. The reason why they did so was to make people panic and put pressure on the Yan Clan and the royal family. This time, they were here to embarrass the Yan Clan and the royal family.</p>
 <p>Hence, quite a lot of warriors had already sneaked into Yan City. They even used special methods to investigate regarding any Scarlet Flame Region’s warriors hidden into the crowd.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, the royal family still had some power. Even though it was something which seemed impossible, they still managed to carry out the task quite efficiently. Within a few days, they had already filtered out and killed almost a hundred people who were all powerful experts from the Scarlet Flame Region.</p>
 <p>Doing so would also enrage the people from Scarlet Flame Region. Nevertheless, there would still be a limit to which how far they would go. Just like the fact that both good people and bad people wanted to survive, there would never be a day when bad people would be completely annihilated. It would be fine as long as they could achieve a “balance” or a state of “peace”.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought to himself that he would go and visit the Scarlet Flame Region when he had time. It was rumored that Yang Stones might appear there. However, those were only rumors and it wasn’t certain if there really were Yang Stones there.</p>
 <p>What currently concerned Qing Shui the most was this girl of unknown origin. If it was fast, the Blood Terminator Bead would completely awaken within her in two months. . Hence, Qing Shui wanted to help her before it awakened.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui had nothing to do in the afternoon, he directly pulled the girl to practice fist techniques with him. He would also help her nurse her body. Only if her body was strong enough would she feel less pain when the pill awakened.</p>
 <p>He strengthened her meridians, Constitution Nurturing, Rainbow Trout Fish, as well as some medicinal pills. Little by little, Qing Shui improved her body. The main method he used was acupuncture.</p>
 <p>His strength had increased, his Nine Yang Golden Body achieving large success stage. Other than Five Elements Acupuncture, Constitutional Nurturing Acupuncture and more, he had even acquired something called Nine Yang Golden Needle Acupuncture.</p>
 <p>The Nine Yang Energy was really mysterious. The world were divided into Yin and Yang and so were humans. Regardless of whether they were men or women, they were still divided into Yin and Yang. Only by blending Yin and Yang would one maintain the balance within one’s body.</p>
 <p>The Nine Yang Gold Needle could regulate the Yang Energy within one’s body. When it got a bit too high, it could decrease it. When it got low, it could also increase the energy. Using this method could help find balance with the Yin Energy. Of course, it could be regulated within an appropriate range, letting one of them to slowly increase in order to catch up with the other. This was the same theory of mutual promotion and restraint in the Five Element Acupuncture.</p>
 <p>It was just that the use of the Nine Yang Gold Needle was even more significant. For example, when a person who was impotent got injected a Nine Yang Gold Needle by Qing Shui, he would immediately turn into a robust man.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had just come to understand that the most important thing about the Nine Yang Gold Needle was that it could help people break through their bottlenecks, in crease as well as stabilize their strength. It could arouse one’s potential power, permanently or temporarily increase their power.</p>
 <p>The girl still didn’t like talking. When Qing Shui asked about her name, she only replied that she didn’t know. Seeing this, Qing Shui stopped asking. He only hoped for the ice-cold body of hers to get warmer.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the girl only talked to him and no anyone else. She wouldn’t even look at them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought it might have been because he was the one who brought her back.</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow, the Yan Clan is organizing a dinner. Come with me. Even though the food won’t taste as good as mine, I will make some specially for you, is that alright?” Qing Shui looked into the sky and asked.</p>
 <p>“I can eat anything.”</p>
 <p>The girl looked at Qing Shui and said gently. She saw Qing Shui’s warm eyes and saw the concern in his eyes. These were eyes she used to only be able to see in her memories.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, can you tell me what will make you happy?” Qing Shui felt more familiar with her. Hence, he pretended like he asked the question by accident.</p>
 <p>The girl shook her head and didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect that she would say anything to him now. He only hoped that he could make her relax little by little. There were things hidden deep in her heart. The vicious aura within her heart was too strong. It could be described as bearing so much hate it was enough to weigh the sky. The resentment, vicious and pernicious aura had already taken on a form of its own. Even if Qing Shui made her wear a jade pendant, she would still attract people’s attention, just that it wouldn’t be as bad as when he first saw her.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui finished carving the seal formations on the Nine Yang Sword. The legendary weapon was finally considered to be completed. Even though this powerful weapon didn’t belong to him, he had also managed to gain benefits from it. He managed to increase his strength significantly because of it. To be more precise, the advantages which he got were no less valuable than the weapon itself.</p>
 <p>For the remaining time, Qing Shui would spend it studying the Nine Yang Gold Needle. He would experiment on himself. Just like this, time passed unknowingly. Eventually, he realized that the Nine Yang Gold Needle could not only treat illnesses, it could also increase one’s strength and strengthen the body. Furthermore, it could also be used to kill opponents. The Nine Yang Gold Needle was really sharp and could pierce through armors with the Hidden Weapons Technique. It could be used to destroy armor using methods learned from Hidden Weapons. The Nine Yang Force within it could be used to destroy acupoints and meridians. This was precisely what the Nine Yang Energy was, able to both kill and treat someone.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the second day, Qing Shui woke up in the morning as usual, only to find that the girl was already up. She seemed to be waiting for Qing Shui to continue their morning practice together. This time, Qing Shui cultivated his own techniques while the girl practiced her Taichi Fist.</p>
 <p>The girl seemed more proficient today. She seemed to have great talent in the Taichi Fist. However, Qing Shui was concerned that the Taichi fist carried a pernicious aura when performed by the girl.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was once again shocked by the baleful aura within her body. To think that the Taichi Fist would have such a feeling when she displayed it. He didn’t know if this was a good or bad thing. This meant that the Taichi Fist was cleansing the pernicious aura within her body, as long as she could protect her mind and sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would help her inject needles every day and at the same time helped her direct the bloodthirst and pernicious aura within her body. He knew that he couldn’t restrict it, nor was he able to guide it out. Hence, the only thing he could do was to guide it to avoid this pernicious aura damaging her mind or heart.</p>
 <p>It was fine as long as she didn’t lose herself!</p>
 <p>When the sun had risen high into the sky, Yan Jinyu rode her Dragon Horse Cart to pick up Qing Shui. The person driving the cart was still that old man, whom Yan Jinyu addressed as Uncle Zong.</p>
 <p>Along with Yan Jinyu, there were also the Seventh Princess and Yan Yangzhao. However, Yan Yangzhao was sitting outside and chatting with Uncle Zong.</p>
 <p>The moment when Qing Shui once again met the old man, he was in awe. Back then, it was in Firecloud Blacksmith Store in Divine Weapon Street when he met him. A State Master level expert was actually driving a cart. Now, he had finally gotten to see the true strength of this old man.</p>
 <p>The old man was slightly stronger than the present Yan Jinyu. He could be considered a true Grade Two State Master. Unfortunately, he was far weaker when compared to Qing Shui now. Currently, Qing Shui had already reached a height far above that of the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man felt that it was inconceivable to see Qing Shui again and was also secretly glad.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yan, brother, why are you here? We are just about to head out,” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“That’s good, get in the cart then, we are here precisely to see why you haven’t arrived yet,” Yan Qignyu chuckled.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu’s Dragon Horse Cart was really huge. It was as big as a small house. Hence, it was still exceptionally spacious when they got in. Qing Shui held the girl’s hand as he entered.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu and Seventh Princess tried talked to the girl. Despite their attempts, she still remained silent. The two girls didn’t have much opinion about it, as though it was very normal. This made Qing Shui feel that the two girls were really kind.</p>
 <p>“Seventh Princess, I am already done forging your weapon. Do you want me to pass it to you now or later?” Qing Shui and the others were sitting around the round table inside the cart.</p>
 <p>“You’ve forged it? You managed to do it?” The Seventh Princess seemed really surprised.</p>
 <p>“Here!” Qing Shui could tell she was excited and knew that she must be really looking forward to seeing it, hence he just handed it to her right away.</p>
 <p>The Nine Yang Gold Sword looked really beautiful and was suitable for both men and women. After all, the three foot long Greenedge Sword was suitable for both genders as well. Seriously speaking, there were also female martial artists who used large hammers, axes and other kinds of heavy weapons, just that only very few of them do so.</p>
 <p>The Seventh Princess really liked the sword. The Nine Yang Sword looked really beautiful and godly. The instant she received the weapon, she was stunned and looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, this weapon…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head and smiled, “I was in luck this time, I even wanted to keep it for myself.”</p>
 <p>“Should I gift it to you then?” The Seventh Princess looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Forget it, I can see you are reluctant to do so. A gentleman never takes away someone’s love. Moreover, I am more used to using my own weapon,” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“How shall I thank you, this is too precious.” Despite the fact that Seventh Princess had experienced many things, she was unable to stay calm ever since she received the sword.</p>
 <p>“You haven’t done the things you promised me.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will ask the Eldest princess for help. As long as your wife is as strong as you described, we should be able to get some news about her.” The Seventh Princess’s eyes brightened when she mentioned the eldest princess.</p>
