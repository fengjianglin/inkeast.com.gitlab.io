 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am flattered, you are?”Qing Shui greeted the man with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve even forgotten to introduce myself, I am Ziche Yu, I’ve come here today to seek Miraculous Physician Qing’s aid with treating a disease, would Miraculous Physician Qing have the time?” The man courteously asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shocked upon seeing the man, as to find a man of his strength, middle-aged looking, though his age was age would not be small, it wouldn’t be very large either, yet his strength was exceptional, reaching about a hundred million Yang of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Yu was equally shocked, as he could not sense Qing Shui’s strength, Qing Shui’s strength was purely a mystery to him, as it was not very strong, as if he did not have any cultivation at all, but he felt like Qing Shui was fathomless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could you describe the symptoms?” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid Miraculous Physician Qing may want to laugh, but even I don’t know what symptoms the Old Master has.” Ziche Yu subtly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, then I’ll go take a look.” Qing Shui responded after thinking some more. The Ziche Clan was a major clan of Linhai City, regardless of the outcome his visit would not make him suffer any losses, Qing Shui was not worried about his chances of treating the patient,only wishing not to draw trouble upon himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, treating one person was synonymous with offending another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ziche Clan’s position within Linhai City was a completely different direction, it was relatively further, but to them the distance was negligible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Imperial Cuisine Hall hasn’t opened for long, but your reputation has spread far and wide.” The two were seated on Ziche Yu’s mount travelling towards the Ziche Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s inexpensive!” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No way, the treatment should be pretty cheap, but the Jade Steamed Bun should be relatively expensive.” Ziche Yu said laughingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You get what you pay for, spending money to buy comfort, haven’t you seen them spend money contentedly, there is no sense of getting cheated.” Qing Shui said smilingly</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miraculous Physician Qing also has a talent for business, it seems you’ve grasped the hearts of the people.” Ziche Yu made fun of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t there such a story, when people first do business, they are all very honest, you get what you pay for, when a shop selling counterfeit goods opens, extremely cheap, everyone would buy their wares from there, allowing one person to get rich quickly, while other would begin to mimic him, and the whole market would only become filled with counterfeits, then a shop selling only true goods would open, with others having cold doorsteps, only theirs being bustling with activity, despite selling the goods at an expensive price.” QIng Shui laughingly described a business story from his previous life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This story was splendid, Miraculous Physician Qing would certainly be an exceptional businessman.” Ziche Yu said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head: “Speaking and acting are vastly different, I can only speak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miraculous Physician Qing is being overly modest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not continue tangling with him on this matter. Casually discussing matters about Linhai City, Qing Shui took special care asking matters about the Ice Ocean Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately the responses he obtained were also uncertain, Ziche Yu’s strength was only sufficient to hear rumours, even listening to the words of powerhouses was only hearsay, to trust in those words would depend on the individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did believe, as the events happening to him were already very peculiar, what else was unbelievable, thinking about his stubbornness in trying to obtain answers from others, Qing Shui felt bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing the Ziche Clan, did Qing Shui understand what was style, it had much more style than the courtyard the Hua Clan had gifted Qing Shui, the Ziche Clan’s courtyard was the best he had seen, at least according to what Qing Shui felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Imperial palaces of dynasties he had visited in the past all paled in comparison to the Ziche Clan’s courtyard, the grandeur, most importantly the solemn dignity, displayed the exalted status of the owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this level, it was more of a charm, only saying it was grand and having facilities was too commonplace, good buildings seemed to almost have a soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miraculous Physician Qing, please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Yu courteously said at the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and nodded his head as he entered the Ziche Clan house with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away, there was a man who looked similar to Ziche Yu, only a little younger, after seeing Ziche Yu he rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Brother!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“En, Is the Old Master in the main courtyard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is, this must be Miraculous Physician Qing! Hello!” The man smiled cordially and greeted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello!” Qing Shui returned the greeting, following them to the main courtyard not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no idea what the Ziche Clan was discussing, there weren’t many people in the main courtyard, but there were still a dozen or so, though upon seeing Ziche Yu and Qing Shui arrive they all stood up on courtesy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Qing Shui feel very satisfied, as Qing Shui had seen many large clans flaunt their status, in this case they wouldn’t take a doctor seriously at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was actually rather shocked, he originally thought that there would only be two people here, not expecting the large group, only he had no idea of what they were doing, perhaps they were having a family meeting?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miraculous Physician Qing, let me make some introductions, this is my father, these are my siblings, this is the oldest Ziche Long……” Ziche Yu made introductions to Qing Shui individually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my youngest sister, Ziche Sha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Qing Shui immediately noticed the only woman in the room, this was a charming and seductive women, her looks a mix between a mature woman and a young girl, but Qing Shui could tell that she was still a girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was dignified and graceful, exuding an indescribable charm just standing there, her dignity and poise was very natural, making people feel cordial yet unable to desecrate, bright-eyed and clear white teeth, it was a flawless type of beauty, her five facial features, whether by themselves or together, exquisite and perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The women by Qing Shui’s side were all truly exceptional, but this lady did not lose out to the women on the Portraits of Beauty at all, and this lady had a particular, indescribable flavour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was before Qing Shui would certainly have a few aspirations in his heart, but now he was able to calmly move on, courteously greeting her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady was also rather curious given Qing Shui’s attitude towards her, but she didn’t show any signs superficially, of all the men she had met, essentially all of them were unable to keep this calm, she had an eminent origin, peerless beauty and even strong cultivation, on this point even Linhai City’s number one prince was far inferior to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could feel that Qing Shui’s calm was not one feigned to gain her interest, people often had many strange thoughts, perhaps only a woman like Tantai Lingyan was truly cold, most women had their own weird thoughts regardless of their beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This introduction allowed Qing Shui to realise they were a family bonded by blood, it seems they truly put a lot of importance on the treatment of Ziche Fei’s disease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s begin, Old Master let me take your pulse!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone sat down, Ziche Fei smiled and stretched his hand towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used his fingers to feel his blood vessels, a jet of pure yang qi entering his meridians and viscera.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed slowly, there was absolute silence in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could feel the anxiousness of the other people, while the old man was tranquil and peaceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a good while, Qing Shui retracted his hand, the old man chuckled and drank the tea from a cup on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miraculous Physician Qing, how is my father’s condition?” An almost elderly-looking man asked, this was the oldest child of the old man, Ziche Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His cultivation sealed, his strength is still there, but he is unable to exert any force, equivalent to only having a needle-sized hole in a vat of water, water is unable to rush out, unable to exert a hundredth or even a thousandth of his strength.” Qing Shui lightly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Qing Shui’s words the old man’s eyes brightened, it had to be said, those who could recognize the situation only numbered three, of which each was a supreme Alchemist, ZIche Fei was a toothless tiger, but his prestige was not affected, as his strength was still there, no one could tell that he was unable to exert his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The children were all shocked, through Ziche Yu, Qing Shui already knew that these children did not know the symptoms of the old man’s disease, some things that had to be kept secret had to be done thoroughly, the children were not untrustworthy, but rather there was no need to let them know as there were no benefits to be had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only this time Qing Shui did not understand, nor did he care about understanding, why he let his children be here to hear the diagnosis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mister is indeed a Miraculous Physician, would Mister have any plans?” Ziche Fei smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Master is perhaps unaware of how your body got into this state?” Qing Shui said with a complicated look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was shocked: “ Mister’s meaning is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a kind of poison, odorless and tasteless, clogging ninety nine percent of a key position along your Ren and Du meridians.” QIng Shui looked at the old man and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I became this way after almost succumbing to my inner demons while cultivating and surviving, it shouldn’t be a poison right?” The old man shot an incisive glance towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew what the old man meant, after all there were few who could poison the old man, Qing Shui was originally contemplating whether or not to declare it in front of his children, after much thought, he felt it would do no harm, so he simply said it directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, this kind of poison could not be refined by those without good skills, Qing Shui smiled as he said: “ Alright, I won’t think about that further, I’d just like to remind your, since they could administer this poison, they could definitely administer more venomous poisons, the other party may not be a patient person, I believe old man you can guess their identity, no one would just poison Old Master without rhyme or reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re saying you can treat me?” The old man said in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As long as one has even a single breath left, I can bring that person back from the devil’s door.” Qing Shui smiled and said, taking out some golden needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s words gave off an incomparable air of confidence and charm, or more precisely an air of strength, to think that doctors could also speak tyrannically, indeed, the air he gave off was one of tyranny and confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was also jolted, he had seen the confidence Qing Shui was giving off only on the Old Ancestor of the clan, to think this man’s medical skill had already reached such a degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, the treatment process will be accompanied by slight pain, I will have to sever your meridians to filter out the toxins, before re-attaching them.” Qing Shui calmly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was calm, but giant waves began to surface in the hearts of the people surrounding him, including the old man himself, severing meridians then re-attaching them…...</span></p>
