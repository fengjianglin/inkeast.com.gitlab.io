 <p><strong>Chapter 86 Detoxifying Poison.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0086 – Detoxifying Poison</strong></p>
  <p>“Should I eat her or not?”</p>
  <p>Complications arose in his heart as Qing Shui gazed at Shi Qingzhuang, who had abandoned all restraint after getting poisoned with an aphrodisiac. Although he had a way to cure her, that method was too beastly.</p>
  <p>His own medical skills may be sufficient to detoxify the poison within Shi Qingzhuang, but if he really did that, then he wouldn’t be any different from a beast. Despite this, Qing Shui really wanted to be a beast for once.</p>
  <p>The dark side of his heart surfaced, or more accurately, the selfish side of his heart, as a thought appeared in Qing Shui’s mind. Not taking advantage when it’s right in front of you, are you stupid or an idiot!</p>
  <p>The thought of lust got increasingly stronger!</p>
  <p>He tightly embraced Shi Qingzhuang, as the horse galloped towards the exit they managed to swiftly exit the city. As the guard manning the city entrance saw the horse of Shi Qingzhuang, he didn’t dare to bar the way. Not only that, Shi Qingzhuang was tightly embracing a man atop the horse. He was so shy that he didn’t dare to incline his head. It seemed like she was on extremely close terms with the guy riding the horse.</p>
  <p>After exiting the city, Qing Shui allowed the Emberlion steed to run free. After they left the city, his hands had not been idle, as he constantly caressed the beautiful contours and outline of Shi Qingzhuang’s body.</p>
  <p>“F*ck, the weather is so cold. I should find a good place to f*ck her, so as to detoxify the poison. Or should we just engage in public s*x out in the wilds? I’m not afraid of the cold, but I’m afraid her tender skin might get damaged.” Qing Shui contemplated his surroundings as he cursed in a low voice.</p>
  <p>“Let me go!” a hoarse voice sounded out.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui got a shock as he heard the voice, and lowered his head only to see Shi Qingzhuang. Her face was enraptured in ecstasy. She shook her head furiously, trying to regain her senses, as blood seeped out of the corners of her mouth.</p>
  <p>She bit her tongue to regain her clarity. Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel an unknown sense of pain in his heart. He stopped the steed, as he gently carried Shi Qingzhuang before dismounting, still holding her tightly in his embrace.</p>
  <p>All intentions of s*x with Shi Qingzhuang disappeared from his head. In Qing Shui’s heart, other than feeling a slight bit of depression, a hint of admiration also arose because of her unbending determination!</p>
  <p>“You were poisoned by Situ Bufan.” Qing Shui had to remind her. He knew that Shi Qingzhuang had understood too. Earlier she had been kissing Qing Shui madly, and even grabbing and caressing his manhood with no intention of stopping.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui regretted that he did not take the time to properly enjoy the taste of Shi Qingzhuang’s dainty little mouth. He should have taken the initiative to kiss her more, tasting her tongue and lips, but there wasn’t any opportunity to do that while on the horse.</p>
  <p>“I know!” A look of extreme pain and helplessness flashed in her eyes, as she struggled to maintain her clear-headedness. However, desire gradually suffused that tender looking face, as her eyes started misting over.</p>
  <p>Just as Qing Shui wanted to explain some other methods that he had at his disposal that might help cure her, Shi Qingzhuang who was cradled in his arms, whispered in his ears. “Mount the horse, about 10 li from here there is a small manor I own. My horse knows the way, quickly…I… can’t… control it anymore…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s thingy almost exploded out of his pants upon hearing those words. The gentle voice which was filled with hints of desire was so comfortable to hear. So many twists and turns, “My spring days are finally coming soon!” Qing Shui hurriedly carried Shi Qingzhuang as he excitedly mounted the horse.</p>
  <p>A distance of 10 li would normally require a travel time of about one hour on foot, but it only took around the time it takes to brew a cup of tea when travelling on horseback! Halfway down the road, Shi Qingzhuang had lost control and started kissing Qing Shui’s face and lips again. This time, Qing Shui had no more hesitation, as he immediately took the initiative and locked his lips with Qing Shizhuang while caressing her body as she moaned, losing herself in ecstasy.</p>
  <p>Perfect!</p>
  <p>Suddenly, the Emberlion steed halted its steps, as Qing Shui evaluated the surroundings. This place was truly well out of the way. There was no way for people to discover it unless they already knew of its existence.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carried Shi Qingzhuang in his arms as he kicked open the door. The door was made of stone, and was extremely heavy. It was impossible to open it unless one possessed a few hundred Jin of strength. Most probably, it was used to prevent wild beasts from coming in.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui after entering, closed the stone door, and left the Emberlion steed in the garden.</p>
  <p>The inside of the courtyard was extremely clean and tidy. There were no weeds growing anywhere, and it seemed that Shi Qingzhuang visited here often. The manor consisted of two levels, with two rooms on each level. Upon seeing that, Qing Shui made his decision and sprinted to the second level. He entered a room near the stairs, and arrived near a bed with a snow-white cover.</p>
  <p>Looking at Shi Qingzhuang in his embrace, who had already started to disrobe, hints of uncertainty flashed in Qing Shui’s eyes. He knew that if he missed this chance, he would regret it his entire life.</p>
  <p>“I’m afraid that she will hate me after this, but even so, if I can’t obtain her love, then I might as well make her hate me forever.”</p>
  <p>“Hatred only starts from love. If I can’t make her fall in love with me, then I shall let her hate me instead. Hating me to the point of gnashing her teeth with fury, with me filling her thoughts every night before she sleep!” Qing Shui decisively decided.</p>
  <p>With no more hesitation, Q ing Shui gently put Shi Qingzhuang on the bed. The fragrance from the flowers permeated the room, but Qing Shui didn’t notice it, as he was too engrossed in the fragrance of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>From the start, the nefarious fire in his loins had never been extinguished, and his manhood had swelled up to the point that he was afraid that it might explode. Shi Qingzhuang, under the effects of the aphrodisiac, had already totally lost control, and was madly kissing Qing Shui, and wildly clawing at his body.</p>
  <p>That passionate kissing caused the blood of Qing Shui to surge, and very quickly both of them laid naked on the bed. Only now did Qing Shui understand the power of the nefarious fire. With his blood surging, he couldn’t even think straight anymore. Lying on top of Shi Qingzhuang, he inserted his manhood inside her as he began to pump and thrust his hips for all he was worth. That feeling… It felt so natural. Moans of pleasure echoed all about, as both Qing Shui and Shi Qingzhuang joined their bodies together, writhing madly in passion.</p>
  <p>Now, Qing Shui finally understood the taste of women…</p>
