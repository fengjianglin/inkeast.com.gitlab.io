 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2265 - Killing the Divine Hog King Instantly, Receiving the Skull</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one that was charging at the very front was that Divine Hog King which was the most ferocious. Qing Shui had no idea how strong the Divine Hog King was on the outside, but it was only at Peak Martial Saint here. However, he saw that it had an oily body and a hide several meters thick. Its hide was like steel, with its fur standing up like a porcupine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperor's Qi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stellar Transposition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't use the other techniques. His physical body was only at the level of a Martial Saint. So, this was already his limit, and there was no way for him to reinforce it any further since there was a restriction imposed there. However, he could apply reinforcements to other people. At the thought of this, Qing Shui rapidly activated his formations and the Battle God Halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were still differentiations amongst those of the same level. This was a matter of the individual's limits. Many people were unable to reach the limits of their cultivation realms as it was far too difficult. Therefore, during times like these, supporting and reinforcing abilities could be put to use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An astonishing sound rang out. Qing Shui could cause the Divine Hog King to explode at his current realm. The Stellar Transposition ignored the opponent's defense, striking into the interior of the Divine Hog King, destroying its most fragile parts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A short agonizing cry rang out, and the Divine Hog King's huge body that was like a mountain suddenly collapsed. It rolled several rounds on the ground and stopped moving anymore; it had charged on at a very fast speed earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instant kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The powerful and domineering Divine Hog King died just like that. This made all the demonic beasts come to a stop. Qing Shui went up to grab one of the Divine Hog King's huge legs and lifted it up...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This took many people by surprise. What kind of strength was this? There were quite a number of people here who could actually lift this amount of weight, especially people who tempered their bodies. However, there were definitely not many who would be able to lift this weight so easily with just one hand. Even adolescent pure-blooded Desolate Beasts would only barely be able to achieve this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people backed off. If they were struck by this huge Divine Hog King’s corpse, they would probably be crippled even if they didn't die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden appearance of a powerful existence like Qing Shui stunned every man and demonic beast. What kind of existence was the Divine Hog King? There were only a few here who could harm the Divine Hog King. And most people would probably not even be able to break through its terrifying defenses. But to think that this young man had managed to kill it in one blow...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Pan Gang saw this, he tossed the bear palm to Qing Shui, "Thanks!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui received it and after some thought, tossed it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. "Don't stand on ceremony. We're on the same team."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The countenance of the man from the Nine Continents Martial Association turned grim. He had sacrificed this bear palm in order to get rid of Qing Shui. He had wanted to toss it to Qing Shui but felt that it would make his intentions too obvious. He knew that Qing Shui was on the same group with these few people and that it would produce the same effect to toss it to another member in the group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what he had planned, but the result was too astonishing. It felt as if he had just thrown away something good for nothing in return. Moreover, their agreement was considered to have fallen through. It'd be useless for him to shift the blame anymore unless Qing Shui got his hands on the skull. Otherwise, no one would be willing to offend Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who is this? He's too tough. To think that he can deal with the Divine Hog King instantly."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I feel that he's more like a pure-blooded Desolate Beast. Hell, he's even more violent than those Beasts!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I think so too. But this is a good thing. At least, those demonic beasts will have to be more cautious now. This time around, there's going to be a lot more humans who can get out of this place alive. This is good news for Kaoshan City."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things didn't turn out to be different from Qing Shui's expectations. After all, there were so many demonic beasts and humans. In the event that all of them were to attack him together, it would be a horrible plight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked toward that man from the Nine Continents Martial Association who was also looking at Qing Shui very calmly, as if the previous action had nothing to do with him. At this moment, the man turned his gaze toward the Golden Primordial Bear's head. It was because he knew that the Dragon Slaying Beast was inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although no one dared to make a move against Qing Shui right now, he wasn't sure what would happen later. If these people were to find out that he had gotten his hands on quite a lot of good stuff, there'd probably be quite a number of people who would take action against him. People were willing to die over money after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui utterly detested this young man from the Nine Continents Martial Association. He felt that this person would definitely not leave things be, but Qing Shui wasn't afraid. If the young man wished to offend him, then Qing Shui would let him stay there forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Dragon Slaying Beast had gotten his hands on the skull and sent a thought to Qing Shui. Qing Shui broke into a smile. Right now, what he needed to do was to send the Dragon Slaying Beast into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal without other people noticing. After that, he would become the greatest winner amongst everyone present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took out the Golden Battle Halberd and then cut off big pieces of the Golden Primordial Bear as if there wasn't anyone around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Battle Halberd was very sharp and sometimes, it had the ability to pierce through defenses regardless of the condition. Qing Shui had enough strength and thus managed to get away with quite a big piece in a short period of time. The piece of flesh still had the bones and blood vessels intact with no blood leaking out. However, even the blood was something good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Qing Shui moved, the others did so as well. All of them started to cut away the Golden Primordial Bear's body. Its body was too big and many people weren't able to break through its defense. However, they were still unwilling to give up and would continue to grind away, hoping to be able to get away with a chunk of the Golden Primordial Bear’s flesh or hide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was strong and thus managed to take up a spot near the bear's chest. He knew that the Dragon Slaying Beast had eaten quite a bit of the Golden Primordial Bear's flesh and organs, refining them and becoming a lot stronger. Most importantly, the Dragon Slaying Beast now also possessed 50% of the Primordial Bloodline. The large part of the Golden Primordial Bear's heart that had been eaten by the Dragon Slaying Beast was the source of its Primordial Bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, right now, the Dragon Slaying Beast was able to advance and break through the interior of the Golden Primordial Bear's body more easily. It had become even more terrifying than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people had their eyes on Qing Shui, and at this moment, he called out the Nine Continents Mountain and smashed it directly toward the Golden Primordial Bear's head. Qing Shui, on the other hand, glimmered in brilliant gold light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine Continents Mountain smashed at the Golden Primordial Bear's head, the spot where everyone was most concerned about. Even if many people were unable to get their hands on it, they wanted to find out who got it. At this moment, many people were shocked to see something like a small mountain smashing out toward the Golden Primordial Bear's head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man from the Nine Continents Martial Association was also taken by surprise. However, he didn't see where the Nine Continents Mountain had smashed into but looked toward Qing Shui instead. When he saw that piercing golden light, he knew that things weren't good. He quickly lashed out a kick toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corners of Qing Shui's lips curled up into a hint of smile and he kicked out as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, something that was like an afterimage darted into Qing Shui's body. It was the Dragon Slaying Beast. At the same moment, Qing Shui's leg collided with the leg of that man from the Nine Continents Martial Association.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were evenly matched. Qing Shui's attacking prowess wasn't as terrifying as when he was outside, but it was still considered terrifying at the Martial Saint level. The Tiger Tailwhip Kick's damaging prowess was quite good, and it was a little vicious. However, the man's kicks were also strong, and he managed to stop Qing Shui's.</span></p>
