I've already waited for so many years. I won't mind waiting for a little longer. Even if I can't get my revenge, I don't want to see anything happen to you." Tantai Lingyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Your man is very powerful, it's just that I'm too young. If I were to be of the same age as them, I'd be able to crush them with a single finger."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Shameless!" The corners of Tantai Lingyan's lips curled up into a happy smile.</span></p>

Even my bones had turned weak." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You aren't allowed to say this..."</span></p>

Earlier on, she realized that she wasn't even able to move at all, and her body felt so limp that it was as if she didn't have any bones at all. She felt so good that she was almost on the verge of fainting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's hands could let even those restless women fall wholeheartedly for him, even if they didn't go all the way. Qing Shui's hands would definitely make them over 100 times more comfortable. Of course, in terms of mental impact, the actual act would still have a stronger impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, alright, I won't say it any more. You felt good, but I still have to hold it in." Qing Shui rested her body slightly, and his lower part bulged up against her hips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, give me a little more time. I still can't do it at the moment, but I'll be able to attain a breakthrough soon, and when that time comes, I'll be yours." Tantai Lingyan said apologetically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, "I'm fine. When I'm with a goddess like you, I'll become hard countless times a day. I can't possibly do it every single time I turn hard. Otherwise, we'll be spending our days only in bed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Shameless!" Tantai Lingyan didn't seem to detest hearing Qing Shui's lewd words. Only Qing Shui could say such things before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This isn't shameless. This is a sacred act that all men and women would have to do. It's a legacy, and everyone comes to this world through this. Lingyan, do you think that we should have a son or a daughter in the future?" Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who's going to give birth to your child?" Tantai Lingyan said softly. She thought fondly of this possibility but was unable to describe what she was feeling now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You don't like children?" Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't know. This matter seems to be very far away from me, and I've never thought about it before."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Think of a child calling you mother." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan shivered as she thought of her younger days and her parents who had doted on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"He is someone you gave birth to after ten months of pregnancy and is connected to you by blood. Your blood will flow in his body; he'll be our child, the product of our relationship." Qing Shui hugged her tightly and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We'll have a kid." Tantai Lingyan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Where's your weapon? Give it to me. I'll strengthen it for you." Qing Shui thought of the Treasure Basin and that Coldfrost from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was the Divine Sword that was most suited to the ice element.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan handed her weapon to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, it was already in the afternoon. Qing Shui led Tantai Lingyan to the second floor; this floor belonged to Qing Shui. The floor above them belonged to Nuo Lan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're back!" Nuo Lan greeted Qing Shui when she saw him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they came back earlier, Nuo Lan had gotten to know Tantai Lingyan. Despite so, she was unwilling to disturb Qing Shui since Tantai Lingyan and Qing Shui were husband and wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, she left after greeting them. After all, she had her own things to do. Being in charge of the Divine Palace's intelligence wasn't such a leisurely job.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two bedrooms on the second floor; thus, Tantai Lingyan took the other one. She said that she wanted to have some rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and nodded, "I know that you're tired. I'll call you when the food is ready."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan blushed and nodded. She understood Qing Shui and thus, knew what he was teasing her about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took out that Coldfrost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had always felt that the Goddess' Sword, which Tantai Lingyan was using now, wasn't really suited for the Glacier Divine Sword. At the very least, it was lacking some of the additional reinforcements from the Glacier Divine Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt that this Coldfrost was the most suitable material for it. However, if the Goddess Divine Set were to be used separately, its ability would be reduced. Therefore, Qing Shui gave up on the idea of changing her sword. After all, changing the sword would produce similar results, or the sword could become even weaker than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui now planned on merging the Coldfrost into the Goddess' Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He first put the Goddess' Sword into the Treasure Basin to raise its abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Coldfrost's abilities had been raised previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had placed the Goddess' Sword into the Treasure Basin the moment they came back. Although not much time had passed outside, a long time had passed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, only after the sword had stayed another month or so in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, did Qing Shui took out the sword and started the merging process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The process was considered quite smooth. After all, the Ancient Art of Forging was quite powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess' Sword still remained the Goddess' Sword, but it now had the greatest attribute that belonged to the Coldfrost—the prowess of ice element techniques was doubled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prowess of the Goddess' Sword wasn't bad to begin with, and now, it was even more suitable for performing the Glacier Divine Sword.</span></p>

He had no idea when the Hundred Treasure Chest will be activated. Back then, it was a month in the real world. When Qing Shui brought it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he discovered that it would still take the same amount of time it would in the outside world. This made Qing Shui feel that this Hundred Treasure Chest wasn't something ordinary. To think that it wouldn't be affected by the time flow of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>

The first tier had already brought him so many Divine Square Cauldrons. He wondered if there would still be more Divine Square Cauldrons this time around.</span></p>

If he could raise the grade of the Divine Weapon Flying Sword, he would be able to take revenge for Tantai Lingyan by himself.</span></p>

It had been the Beiwang Clan [2] in the past, but now, the Beiwang Clan had declined. However, there were also people who claimed that the Beiwang Clan was more powerful than they were in the past but had just chosen to keep a low profile.</span></p>

However, unless he could find some miraculous medicinal pills that could allow a person to regrow his bones and flesh, he would have to spend the rest of his life with only one leg.</span></p>

Your Complete Annulus Pill has been stored there for so long. Why don't you let Tianzhi have it? Do you want to see him remain a cripple like this?" A beautiful married lady said, feeling pained.</span></p>

He seemed to be a middle-aged man. He nodded, "Yunzhi, go and get it."</span></p>

After all, this was a huge matter to the Mo Clan since one of their members was forced to chop off his own leg in the Northern King Domain. No matter who was in the right or wrong, this was like a slap in their faces. Therefore, there was no way that this matter could be allowed to rest just like that.</span></p>

This was Mo Situ's life-saving medicinal pill, but he had to give it up to his son now. This thing was very precious and if it wasn't because his woman had pleaded him to, and also because other people had gotten to know of it, he would choose to kill this son of his. He had a number of children, but only a few of this medicinal pill. There would be one less with each use.</span></p>

He understood that although he was considered one of the most outstanding ones amongst his father's many children, he wasn't the best. If it wasn't because his mother was favored, he probably wouldn't have any chances of getting the medicinal pill.</span></p>

Mo Tianzhi said seriously. When he lowered his head, there was a hint of a loss in his gaze, in addition to an indescribable feeling of dejection. Aristocratic clans were heartless. Sometimes, a human might be worse off compared to even an animal.</span></p>
