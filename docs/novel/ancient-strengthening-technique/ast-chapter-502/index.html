 <p><strong>Chapter 502 A bone-chilling gaze.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>502 - A bone-chilling gaze</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The lady kept looking at Qing Shui from afar, her icy complexion without change. She looked just like a snow lotus flower, even now, when looking at Qing Shui, her gaze was icy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What Qing Shui the most afraid of was meeting her gaze, he felt it was particularly strange, she was very pretty, but her gaze was too piercing…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The gaze of that lady would occasionally change, having a hint of a complex look.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Till mid-morning, the lady started to do a slow sword dance with an azure longsword, her sword dance was different from Huoyun Liu-Li’s sword dance, but there were some similarities, they both were graceful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her posture during the sword dance was very beautiful, she had a well-rounded figure, especially her swaying waist, she had what was known as the most beautiful ‘slender and supple waist,’ especially that full bottom below her waist, her perfectly round butt caused Qing Shui’s heart to itch incessantly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Maybe she could feel Qing Shui’s fiery gaze, that lady turned her head to look at Qing Shui. Qing Shui could only awkwardly laugh while rubbing his nose when he met her icy gaze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This lady’s gaze is really cold!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time flew by and another day passed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The lady’s recovery speed was fast, she has basically healed, what led Qing Shui to be surprised was that her abilities were at the Peak Martial King, close to the strength of four countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took another look at the lady, she seemed young, although older than himself, it should not be by much. Since when does the Greencloud Continent have such a young expert?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And these were just the ones that he encountered, how much more had he not encountered?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thoughts moved very fast, and he managed to find a reason very soon. It was that as he got stronger, his circle of contact also grew larger, if he was still at the Xiantian Realm, he probably would not have any hope nor the abilities to meet these people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strength of the Ice Crane was similar to the lady. Qing Shui did not know how that lady came into Flowerfruit Mountain, just one out of the flock of Divine Black Crows would be stronger than the Ice Crane.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go check out the Tricolor Scorpion King!” Qing Shui had already donned his armor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is it far from here?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed that the lady was walking, he caught up and asked suspiciously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s not far!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The lady’s voice was still the same, icy cold, it seemed to have no feelings in it, the number of words in each sentence were few. If she could avoid speaking by nodding her head, she would do so, If she could be silent, she would be.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know if this lady has any friends, even after saving her life, she did not even give him a smile, not even a slight one.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moving through the canyon, they occasionally had to cross a few mountains, but the lady seemed to know &nbsp;a shortcut and passed through some caves.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What was this lady here to do?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not ask her, he felt that asking her that would be rude. Just like how he did not want people to know what he was doing here, thus Qing Shui did not intend to ask her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It is right in front, be careful …… .”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was surprised to hear that from her, although her tone was still icy cold, but Qing Shui felt that was a habit or part of her character.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at where she pointed, he felt his scalp go numb. Qing Shui and that lady were standing on the peak of a small mountain, on the opposite side was a small ravine.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The bottom of the ravine was full of scorpions, each one the size of a small calf…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“F*ck, so big……” Qing Shui could not help but spew out some vulgarities, causing that lady to look at him with an icy glare!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed loudly, feeling embarrassed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most of the scorpions were red, Qing Shui felt depressed when he noticed their size, however, he did not see the Tricolor Scorpion King the lady mentioned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui searched with his eyes, finding it in the midst of the scorpions. He then asked the quiet lady: “how did you get stung by the Tricolor Scorpion King?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Killing it!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shu turned to look at that lady: “You are here to kill this Tricolor Scorpion King?!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s tone was strange!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” the lady said calmly in a cold voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui ridiculed himself, was he too cautious? This lady did not seem like the scheming type, saving her was a coincidence, had he been late in saving her, the poison would have reached her heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What do you want from the Tricolor Scorpion King?” Qing Shui continued to search through the numerous scorpions!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Inner core!” The lady said softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although the lady’s tone was still icy cold, but Qing Shui could feel that when she said inner core, there was a ripple in her heart, like a determined conviction.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can help you get it, but can you tell me what are you going to do with it?” Qing Shui did not know why he asked her that. Maybe he was moved by that lady, or it could be that her life was saved by Qing Shui, thus he felt strange in his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Cure sickness! Mother is sick, the alchemist is lacking this ingredient!” the lady hesitated for a bit before slowly saying it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the longest thing he had heard her say. Now he knew why she seemed so determined. He did not image she was such a filial daughter. In order to cure her mother, she came all the way to Flowerfruit Mountain, had she not ran into him, she would have been dead.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui respected those who were filial to their parents, even if he was an evil person, so long as he was still filial to his parents, he was still a person, a bad person.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui did not feel that she was that cold anymore!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am also an alchemist, the pill I used to treat you with was refined by me, on the account of your filial piety, can you tell more more about your mother’s condition, maybe I can help out?” Qing Shui felt that meeting her in a place like Flowerfruit Mountain could be considered fate, furthermore, he had already saved her life once.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“My mother was injured by the ‘Poison Marsh Kirin,” she is currently barely hanging on.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui could hear some emotions in her voice, distress, helpless, reluctancy…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has heard about the Poison Marsh Kirin before, he could not help but look at that lady. Her mother must be very strong because this Poison Marsh Kirin was a perfect Peak Martial King Demonic Beast, its strength was small compared to it’s poison, it was said that its poison was five-colour graded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her mother could actually suppress the poison of the Poison Marsh Kirin, her strength must be at…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The inner core of the Tricolor Scorpion King should not be able to save your mother.” Qing Shui guessed that they intended to use poison to fight poison and wanted to make an attempt using the inner core of the Tricolor Scorpion King.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is what they said too, but as long as there is a bit of hope, I want to try it.” the lady’s eyes were reddening, her tone resolute.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Actually, given your mother’s situation, I can help you.” Qing Shui lightly smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Really?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at her lecherously, looking at that ice cold complexion, the plumpness and the sexy curvature of her chest, its shape caused Qing Shui to want to bury his head in them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That lady’s tall and thin body was only shorter than Qing Shui by half a head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed that there was no change in expression on the lady’s face, this caused Qing Shui to feel that his earlier leer was wasted…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“As long as you can cure my mother, I will do anything you want!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned, what do you mean anything you want, Qing Shui could not help but feel restless in his heart, if he could cause her to be passionate…… If such a cold person became passionate, there will be a great impact.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You just need to promise me one thing and I will help you!” Qing Shui lightly smiled at her, this cold beauty, an elegant lady, was blinded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blinded by familial relations!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I said it before, as long as you can cure my mother, I will do anything you want!” When she said that, there was no change in her expression, this caused Qing Shui to feel a little hurt.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is for you, the condition is that from now on, you are my women.” Qing Shui took out a porcelain bottle with the Great Revitalizing Pellet and gave it to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How can I be sure that this will cure my mother.” the lady looked at Qing Shui but did not take the porcelain bottle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong with me today, why am I so despicable? I could have violated her earlier, but now I am actually trying to use this method to cheat her into my bed.” Qing Shui shook his head and sighed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The lady’s eyes flashed, that’s right, her life was saved by him, she was very weak then, if he was after her body, she would already have been…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I believe you!” the lady took the pill from Qing Shui’s hands, her eyes full of joy. She remembered the situation when she first saw him battle…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That mean you have decided to be my women” Qing Shui laughed</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The lady was silent and she was in a daze for a moment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So do we stay here or go back to the cave……” Qing Shui vaguely smiled at her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know how else he could agitate her!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah! What do you want to do……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only now, then the lady realized what was about the happen, the cold complexion turned white.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What are we doing? You are now my women, what do you think we can do?” Qing Shui looked once again that the curvy figure of the lady, especially her ample bosom, although it was not big but it had the perfect shape, the curvature caused Qing Shui’s mouth to go dry.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The lady bit her lips, her cold face was pale beyond compare and she even trembled as though she was struggling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept smiling at her, now he could openly look at her, to observe this perfect body close up, Qing Shui enjoyed it, especially in his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the lady’s clan should be a strong family clan, as to which continent she was from, Qing Shui did not know. Thus, Qing Shui felt the need to build a good relationship, that why Qing Shui could bear to take out a Great Revitalizing Pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not bear to see the lady like this, furthermore, Qing Shui still has not settled the women around him yet, he just wanted to leave a deeper impression on this lady.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How about we change the condition since you seem to be in a dilemma……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Really!?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just address me as husband once!”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The bottom of the ravine was full of scorpions, each one the size of a small calf…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“F*ck, so big……” Qing Shui could not help but spew out some vulgarities, causing that lady to look at him with an icy glare!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed loudly, feeling embarrassed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most of the scorpions were red, Qing Shui felt depressed when he noticed their size, however, he did not see the Tricolor Scorpion King the lady mentioned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui searched with his eyes, finding it in the midst of the scorpions. He then asked the quiet lady: “how did you get stung by the Tricolor Scorpion King?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Killing it!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shu turned to look at that lady: “You are here to kill this Tricolor Scorpion King?!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s tone was strange!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” the lady said calmly in a cold voice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui ridiculed himself, was he too cautious? This lady did not seem like the scheming type, saving her was a coincidence, had he been late in saving her, the poison would have reached her heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What do you want from the Tricolor Scorpion King?” Qing Shui continued to search through the numerous scorpions!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Inner core!” The lady said softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although the lady’s tone was still icy cold, but Qing Shui could feel that when she said inner core, there was a ripple in her heart, like a determined conviction.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can help you get it, but can you tell me what are you going to do with it?” Qing Shui did not know why he asked her that. Maybe he was moved by that lady, or it could be that her life was saved by Qing Shui, thus he felt strange in his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Cure sickness! Mother is sick, the alchemist is lacking this ingredient!” the lady hesitated for a bit before slowly saying it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the longest thing he had heard her say. Now he knew why she seemed so determined. He did not image she was such a filial daughter. In order to cure her mother, she came all the way to Flowerfruit Mountain, had she not ran into him, she would have been dead.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui respected those who were filial to their parents, even if he was an evil person, so long as he was still filial to his parents, he was still a person, a bad person.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui did not feel that she was that cold anymore!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am also an alchemist, the pill I used to treat you with was refined by me, on the account of your filial piety, can you tell more more about your mother’s condition, maybe I can help out?” Qing Shui felt that meeting her in a place like Flowerfruit Mountain could be considered fate, furthermore, he had already saved her life once.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“My mother was injured by the ‘Poison Marsh Kirin,” she is currently barely hanging on.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui could hear some emotions in her voice, distress, helpless, reluctancy…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has heard about the Poison Marsh Kirin before, he could not help but look at that lady. Her mother must be very strong because this Poison Marsh Kirin was a perfect Peak Martial King Demonic Beast, its strength was small compared to it’s poison, it was said that its poison was five-colour graded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her mother could actually suppress the poison of the Poison Marsh Kirin, her strength must be at…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The inner core of the Tricolor Scorpion King should not be able to save your mother.” Qing Shui guessed that they intended to use poison to fight poison and wanted to make an attempt using the inner core of the Tricolor Scorpion King.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is what they said too, but as long as there is a bit of hope, I want to try it.” the lady’s eyes were reddening, her tone resolute.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Actually, given your mother’s situation, I can help you.” Qing Shui lightly smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Really?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at her lecherously, looking at that ice cold complexion, the plumpness and the sexy curvature of her chest, its shape caused Qing Shui to want to bury his head in them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That lady’s tall and thin body was only shorter than Qing Shui by half a head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed that there was no change in expression on the lady’s face, this caused Qing Shui to feel that his earlier leer was wasted…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“As long as you can cure my mother, I will do anything you want!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned, what do you mean anything you want, Qing Shui could not help but feel restless in his heart, if he could cause her to be passionate…… If such a cold person became passionate, there will be a great impact.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You just need to promise me one thing and I will help you!” Qing Shui lightly smiled at her, this cold beauty, an elegant lady, was blinded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Blinded by familial relations!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I said it before, as long as you can cure my mother, I will do anything you want!” When she said that, there was no change in her expression, this caused Qing Shui to feel a little hurt.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is for you, the condition is that from now on, you are my women.” Qing Shui took out a porcelain bottle with the Great Revitalizing Pellet and gave it to her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How can I be sure that this will cure my mother.” the lady looked at Qing Shui but did not take the porcelain bottle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong with me today, why am I so despicable? I could have violated her earlier, but now I am actually trying to use this method to cheat her into my bed.” Qing Shui shook his head and sighed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The lady’s eyes flashed, that’s right, her life was saved by him, she was very weak then, if he was after her body, she would already have been…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I believe you!” the lady took the pill from Qing Shui’s hands, her eyes full of joy. She remembered the situation when she first saw him battle…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That mean you have decided to be my women” Qing Shui laughed</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The lady was silent and she was in a daze for a moment!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So do we stay here or go back to the cave……” Qing Shui vaguely smiled at her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know how else he could agitate her!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah! What do you want to do……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only now, then the lady realized what was about the happen, the cold complexion turned white.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What are we doing? You are now my women, what do you think we can do?” Qing Shui looked once again that the curvy figure of the lady, especially her ample bosom, although it was not big but it had the perfect shape, the curvature caused Qing Shui’s mouth to go dry.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The lady bit her lips, her cold face was pale beyond compare and she even trembled as though she was struggling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept smiling at her, now he could openly look at her, to observe this perfect body close up, Qing Shui enjoyed it, especially in his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the lady’s clan should be a strong family clan, as to which continent she was from, Qing Shui did not know. Thus, Qing Shui felt the need to build a good relationship, that why Qing Shui could bear to take out a Great Revitalizing Pellet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not bear to see the lady like this, furthermore, Qing Shui still has not settled the women around him yet, he just wanted to leave a deeper impression on this lady.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How about we change the condition since you seem to be in a dilemma……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Really!?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just address me as husband once!”</p>
