 <p><strong>AST 1205 - Lions go all out even when capturing rabbits. You are not a lion, nor am I a rabbit</strong></p>
 <p>Yan Leng was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he had already rushed onto the arena. He was furious that Yan Yangchen was injured but he also knew how terrifying this man was. Hence, he gave it his all, even using his weapons.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched the devilish man on top of the arena. When he heard the words he said previously, they seemed to be aimed towards the Eldest Princess. Yet he was not a match against Eldest Princess. Based on that, Qing Shui vaguely figured out the man’s identity.</p>
 <p>Scarlet Flame Sect’s Young Sect Lord!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this man should be the young sect lord of the Scarlet Flame Sect. They didn’t done any utterly heartless things to Yan City but they came here to fight in the wedding arena.</p>
 <p>A wedding was a happy event. People who attended it were all guests. Even though the wedding arena was a formality, no one would really dare to wreck other people’s wedding arenas. Even if they were capable of doing so, they still wouldn’t do it.</p>
 <p>And the wedding arena also had an unwritten rule. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t let women go on stage. Of course, this wasn’t absolute. However, this person had already made himself clear. Could it be that other than the Eldest Princess, no one here could beat him?</p>
 <p>It seemed this person was really conceited. This was a challenge to all of the young and talented youths from the different clans but the one to bear the brunt was the Yan Clan.</p>
 <p>Because the Yan Clan was the one currently defending the arena!</p>
 <p>Even though the Eldest Princess had already been called out, if a clan or rather the people present let a woman go up on the arena, it would make the men present seem extremely useless.</p>
 <p>After Yan Leng headed up, he only paused for a while before nodding and said, “Let’s begin!”</p>
 <p>After that, he attacked the man!</p>
 <p>His sword and even his body carried a trace of viciousness. Assassins emphasized killing people with one strike. They often advanced forward bravely. If they failed, they would immediately retreat and look for another chance.</p>
 <p>Yan Leng was like this! After the man avoided his attacks, he quickly retreated before swiftly charging back in with his bizarre footwork.</p>
 <p>This time, the man didn’t attack and retreated instead. When Qing Shui saw the man’s footwork, he let out a sigh. Yan Leng would lose. The gap in their strengths was too large. It was just as people said, in front of absolute strength, any tactics would only result in failure. Let alone the fact that the man’s footwork was not weaker than Yan Leng’s.</p>
 <p>Bare-handed Sword!</p>
 <p>The man calmly advanced forward. His palm turning into an afterimage as he struck toward Yan Leng.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Yan Leng’s body dropped like a kite that had its line cut. This scene made the entire place fall into silence. The Yan Clan still had to send people up but they were hauled back by others.. If they went up, they would only end up injured as well.</p>
 <p>“Chi Limei, if you don’t leave, I won’t mind letting you drop some stuff.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Eldest Princess’s voice sounded. No one from the younger generation were a match to him. She could beat him but so what if she did? He had already made it clear from the beginning and that would only make the people here feel even more sorrowful. Hence, unless it was the last resort, she was reluctant to take action. Actually, deep down, she still had a last hope which was Qing Shui. She was wondering if this fellow would be able to create a miracle once more.</p>
 <p>“Eldest Princess, why won’t you give me a chance? Which part of me is not good enough? I will change, I will listen to whatever you say…” The man said with a frown.</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous, are you really forcing me to kill you?”</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess’s voice was cold and sounded as though she was close to shouting.</p>
 <p>“In that case, I am going to just stand here. I am happy enough to die here today. Unless there is anyone else from the younger generation who can beat me, I would rather die by your hand today.” the man stood on the arena and said softly, as though he was acting shamelessly.</p>
 <p>“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll oblige you!” Eldest Princess’s voice sounded without a trace of emotion.</p>
 <p>“Let me do it. Eldest Princess has an honorable status. Let me take your place.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui stood up and walked towards the arena.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s voice was very abrupt and everyone looked at Qing Shui curiously. They had never thought that there would be someone who still dared to walk up onto the arena at this time. Even Chi Limei himself was shocked as he looked at the young man who was slowly approaching him.</p>
 <p>Chi Limei was the young sect lord of the Scarlet Flame Sect. However, he was taught by other people and also held an unusual position. It was simply that he happened to meet Eldest Princess by chance and was amazed by how beautiful she was. Hence he started to pursue her. Nevertheless, he never once showed any excessive behaviour. Despite this, his leg had still been broken more than ten times by the Eldest Princess.”</p>
 <p>That stubborn attitude shocked everyone familiar with him. However, no one could help the Eldest Princess decide her future, not even the royal family.</p>
 <p>Perhaps because the Eldest Princess didn’t kill him, Chi Limei would think of a method to get close to the Eldest Princess whenever he had the chance. It was also because the Eldest Princess always didn’t kill him that he was unwilling to give up. He believed that one day, she would be touched by his determination.</p>
 <p>“Go down, I don’t want to hurt more people,” Chi Limei told Qing Shui softly, not putting Qing Shui in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you know you won’t defeat me, hence you said that? Are you scared?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“Haha, ignorant people indeed show no fear. Since that is the case, come at me. If you can hold on for three rounds, I will consider it your victory and leave immediately.” Che Limei didn’t know why he was infuriated by Qing Shui. Sometimes, the most pathetic taunting would prove to be the most useful. This was because he simply didn’t care about Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Alright then. In front of all of this crowd today, I am going to tell you one thing, a lion exerts all of its strength even while fighting a rabbit. Besides, you are not a lion, nor am I a rabbit.” Qing Shui smiled and lifted up his hands.</p>
 <p>Taichi Rising Fist.</p>
 <p>Taichi Rising Fist. Only by rising well would one be stable.</p>
 <p>“Well then, I would like to see if you have the ability to make me go all out. Come, I will let you attack first.” Che Limei wasn’t scared by Qing Shui’s words. He felt that he had been through more battles than Qing Shui had ever watched.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also knew how Chi Limei felt. He smiled and said, “Actually, you are too arrogant. Not only that, you are too resigned to fate. Do you know that if you can’t beat her, you will never get the chance? Strong people will always look down on weak people. In her eyes, whoever isn’t capable of beating her will always be weak.” Qing Shui observed Chi Limei’s expression. He seemed to be treating it as teaching him a lesson. Yet, it also seemed like he was telling this to many people.</p>
 <p>This time, Chi Limei was stunned. This was because Qing Shui’s words had made him start thinking. For example, he also looked down on people weaker than him. Just like the people from the Yan Clan whom he defeated just now, even if they had wanted to be friends with him, he wouldn’t be interested in doing so. But what if they were stronger than him?</p>
 <p>He thought about the Eldest Princess, he was most likely a weak person in her eyes. It was already good that she chose not to kill him. The more he thought, the more scared he felt and yet he was still so happy that she didn’t kill him. Now that he thought about it, he realized how pathetic he was.</p>
 <p>Strength was everything!</p>
 <p>“Regardless of the outcome today, I will still thank you. Make your move. Let me see if you are really that strong.” Chi Limei smiled. At this moment, his expression already looked very different from before.</p>
 <p>This was also considered as elevating one’s state? Sometimes, enlightenment was a very weird thing. Not only did it have to happen at the right time and place, in order for it to happen, the right person also played a very important role. If he had been in another place, it was most likely that he wouldn’t take those words to heart.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Nine Palace Steps, immediately charging towards Chi Limei.</p>
 <p>As the saying went, experts would know the depth of things once they made their move. Qing Shui’s movement already made Chi Limei feel nervous. This was because he realized that the footwork of his opponent was too profound.</p>
 <p>Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>A thread of faint gold light appeared on Qing Shui’s body. A palm attacked Chi Limei’s shoulder in a weird way. Within the strangeness, there was also an indescribable ancient feeling.</p>
 <p>Scarlet Fox Hand!</p>
 <p>Chi Limei’s hand flashed with red light as he thrust it towards Qing Shui’s wrist.</p>
 <p>As if Qing Shui would let him do as he pleased. His hand trembled and he rapidly switched it from a palm to a fist.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui retreated and followed up with a flash. With the mysterious Nine Palace Steps, Qing Shui appeared behind Chi Limei and smashed down with one fist.</p>
 <p>He turned around to block the blow!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Chi Limei hurriedly received the blow and unexpectedly retreated a step backwards.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still hadn’t reached his limit. He could continue displaying his strength at an extraordinary level. This was the power of speed and realm. Speed was also a source of strength. This was how the power of speed was embodied.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Chi Limei were fighting bare-handedly. They were only using their physical strength, not even using their Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then followed up with swift punches. He fought Qing Shui bare-handedly. Even if his strength had been really powerful, he was unable to gain the upper-hand. Chi Limei seemed to have already forgotten about the previously mentioned three moves.</p>
 <p>The more he continued fighting, the more fearful he felt. Most importantly, they both felt increasingly carefree and unrestrained. Both sides were using increasing strength and their speeds were also increasing. They were already using their Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation unwittingly.</p>
 <p>Both of them had already left the arena and reached the sky. Chi Limei seemed to be adept in punching and kicking. At the very least, his attainments in close combat were decent.</p>
 <p>Scarlet Fox Tearing Sky!</p>
 <p>On Chi Limei’s hand was a throbbing flame. It was expanding and contracting like a snake’s heart, even bearing a spiral movement.</p>
 <p>Thousand Buddhas Palm Imprint! Shield!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly formed a seal and cast it out. A faint gold light appeared in front of him. He didn’t stop forming seals with his hands.</p>
 <p>One Hand Cover Sky!</p>
 <p>Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation!</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui wasn’t using any weapons, its strength was not something to be looked down upon. Chi Limei retrieved his hands and with fists surging with red light, proceeded to punch the enormous palm imprint above him.</p>
 <p>A red light enveloped a bloody red fist and the lifelike fist clashed heavily against the golden palm imprint.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Both the golden palm imprint and the blood red fist shattered!</p>
 <p>Currently, Chi Limei no longer dared to underestimate this young man. He realized that the punches and kicks which he excelled in weren’t able to give him even the slightest advantage. All along, he had believed that other than Eldest Princess, he remained unconvinced by everyone else in the younger generation.</p>
 <p>Scarlet Blood Ebullition!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chi Limei’s body was shining with red light. After that, he didn’t rush to act, “If you have a weapon, use your weapon. Display your strongest abilities. I don’t want you to regret this.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that his opponent had used his most powerful skill. Hence, he too didn’t dare to be complacent. As he took out the Big Dipper Sword, a pair of bloody red gloves appeared on his opponent’s hands. He could tell that they were no ordinary items just by looking at them.</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>Smash!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Chi Limei who was charging towards him and immediately smashed the Seal of Xuantian at him. In the past, Qing Shui realized that the Seal of Xuantian could be neutralized. But now, it immediately smashed against the opponent’s body. He came to realize that even someone who was a lot stronger than him would be incapable of eliminating this energy in a short period of time.</p>
 <p>Chi Limei’s speed had clearly become slightly slower.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain with his consciousness to strike against Chi Limei!</p>
 <p>He followed that with a thrust with the tip of his sword.</p>
 <p>Diamond Buddha Devil Staff!</p>
 <p>Fourth Staff, Five Soaring Waves!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui unleashed his skills, the Nine Continents Mountain was already pushed back by Chi Limei’s fist.</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again controlled the Nine Continents Mountain forward towards Chi Limei. When it was repelled once again, Qing Shui immediately sent the Nine Continents Mountain to strike towards him. This time, the mountain had an enormous golden staff which Qing Shui cast pressing on it.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>This time, while controlling the Nine Continents Mountain, Qing Shui also pushed down on the mountain with his huge golden staff as he struck towards Chi Limei!</p>
