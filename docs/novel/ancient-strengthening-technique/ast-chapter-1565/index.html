He took out a pill and passed it to her, “See if you are confident. If you are, your strength will be greatly boosted. The Sea King Palace now desperately needs you to increase in strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge stared at the pill bottle Qing Shui passed over. She opened it and stared at Qing Shui in disbelief, “You can actually concoct saint pills successfully?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Saint Pills? Isn’t this a Dragon Pill?” Qing Shui asked in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is concocted with the Saint Flower as the main ingredient. It’s also named Dragon Pill but it’s a Saint Pill to the dragon race.” Muyun Qingge slowly explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s eyes flashed with amazement as he stared at Muyun Qingge. This sentence has cleared up a doubt in Qing Shui’s mind, she is from the dragon race…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a drakaina…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge knew what Qing Shui was thinking when she saw his countenance. However she didn’t say anything, a smile simply flickered in her beautiful eyes as she laughed, “I will be taking this then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you tell me if this pill pose any danger to you?” Qing Shui was still worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, there’s not even the slightest trace of danger if I ingest it. Thank you.” Muyun Qingge happily stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then nod his head, “It’s good to hear that. Are you going to consume it now or after you return?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, I will wait one more day then!” Right now, her emotions were a little excited. This was such a rare and valuable pill. Qing Shui could tell she was already keeping her excited emotions in check.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui naturally agreed. When Muyun Qingge consumed the pill, Qing Shui wasn’t near her but was quite far away instead. However, he would still pay attention to her because he knew from his own experience that even without the toxicity factor, there would still be a great deal of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Muyun Qingge’s situation caused Qing Shui to be badly shocked. Muyun Qingge only used the span of half a day to finish refining it. In addition, there was no commotion at all, everything seemed extremely calm. Nothing unusual happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made him sure that this beautiful woman was mostly from the famed Drakaina race. The Drakaina race is also sometimes called the Divine Dragoness race, but they are both referring to the same thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pill is considered a saint pill to the dragon race. From her reaction earlier, Qing Shui could be clear of this fact. It was just that he wasn’t sure if the dragon pill could be used by demonic beasts with the dragon bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Qing Shui also had no wish to let the people around him attempt this. One must be at the very least at the False God level. Hence, only a limited few around him could consume this. Also, it was simply too dangerous. This was why he wanted to see if his demonic beasts were able to consume it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought of Qin Qing; he should keep one for her. In that case, there were two more pills remaining. He would hold on to them first before he confirms with Muyun Qingge if demonic beasts with dragon blood would be able to consume the dragon pill or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood up when he saw Muyun Qingge walking over. Her aura now grew increasingly ethereal. The rosy red on her cheeks bespoke immense vitality, and he could sense that her cultivation just increased by leaps and bounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She seemed even more beautiful now and her demeanor also underwent a change. This made Qing Shui feel that some of her worries had been discarded; her state of heart was enhanced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw Qing Shui, a happy smile lit up her face. It was so beautiful that it was soul-stirring and caused Qing Shui to be in a daze when he stared at it. Working hard to clear his mind, he sighed to himself on how beautiful women are always trouble. Qing Shui felt that if he fought against this woman, just a smile from her was sufficient to destroy him. In fact, even women would fall prey to her mesmerizing smile. After all, when beauty reaches a certain standard, it cannot be judged simply based on gender. It is a universal concept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Muyun, can demonic beasts with dragon blood consume this?” Qing Shui hurriedly asked, hiding his momentarily daze due to her beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are truly too extravagant. You are willing to feed such a pill to demonic beasts? And the answer to your question is yes, but the prerequisite is that the strength of the beast must be at the false god realm at the very least.” The eyes Muyun Qingge used to look at Qing Shui, was like looking at a wastrel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, that’s good then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, he remembered that once, he himself and a few of his women were all baptised by dragon qi before. Hence, Qing Shui hesitated. He only had a few of these pills left. Would it be a waste if he used them on his demonic beasts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have many saint pills?” Muyun Qingge asked puzzledly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not many, I have two left…” No matter what, Qing Shui decided that he would keep one for Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you a beast tamer?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nope, but I have my own demonic beasts.” Qing Shui spoke after thinking for awhile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I feel that you should keep the pills with you first. If you are a beast tamer and need to rely on your demonic beasts completely, you can feed the pills to them. After all, the demonic beasts would be the lifeline for beast tamers. In any case, such pills are truly too precious, even the dragon race would sacrifice almost anything to get them, yet you are intending to feed the pills to demonic beasts with diluted dragon blood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you mean?”: Qing Shui didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Demonic beasts with dragon blood would reach their peak sooner or later, with or without the dragon pill. Only time is needed. Even if they consumed a dragon pill, they would only reach their peak faster.” Muyun Qingge explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After contemplating for some time, Qing Shui abolished the idea of using them on his Dragon-Slaying Beast. Using them on others seemed more effective. Himself for example, his explosive strength rose and he has yet to reach his peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, with Qing Shui’s strength, he couldn’t unleash the full power the Golden Battle Halberd had, although it was supposed to increase his power by a certain factor. Qing Shui always felt that the little bit of increase when he used it, was totally negligible. Only the Big Dipper Sword could truly augment his strength. Sadly, the sword now was already part of the tiny Paragon within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, the little bit of increase in power the golden battle halberd provided was useless in Qing Shui’s eyes. The only strong thing was that it could be used to block, and that it has an additional effect that would increase the penetration rate. But when Qing Shui wielded the halberd, he discovered that all aspects of his power such as defence, speed, strength, increased by one-fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also an effect of connecting one of the twelve earthly meridians after consuming the Dragon Pill. Qing Shui sensed that his body strength now reached a level close to a billion sun while his spirit attack could reach roughly 1.4 billion sun in power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he could only unleash a little bit of the Golden Battle Halberd’s power temporarily, he had already benefited a lot. In the future, Qing Shui could wield the halberd with one hand and launch a spirit attack with the other. What was the most terrifying was still his defence; it had already reached a level that made him click his tongue in disbelief.</span></p>
