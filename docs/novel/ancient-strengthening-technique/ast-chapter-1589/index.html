 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without looking back, Qing Shui stopped in his tracks for a brief moment before he walked away with long strides again. Watching his retreating back, there was a trace of perplexing melancholy in the woman’s eyes that couldn’t be expressed with words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went back without knowing the woman’s name or even knowing if she was the Mistress of Sunset Palace. Perhaps affected by the concept of monogamy in his previous life, he had an innate phobia towards relationships; to have more than one woman in his life made him feel as though he had wronged them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of his women were outstanding. After some time together, he could also understand the rationale behind Yiye Jiange’s choice this time. None of his women would intervene with his relationships; they would settle with minding their own affairs because there was no way they could have Qing Shui to themselves at all times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew by now that the thought of gathering them would be a difficult feat, much less living with them under the same roof.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pushing aside these thoughts, he recalled the Portrait of Twelve Beauties—there was only one left. His view on relationships was ever-changing and at this point, even he wasn’t sure about where he stood on them anymore. All that he knew was that he had to evade any more prospective relationships and focus on cherishing what he had now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, this was just the natural course of life: meeting what you want to avoid, and losing what you want to find.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui returned straight to his tent. The two women were still there, seemingly in discussion. Seeing Qing Shui, they greeted him in passing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I haven’t seen you for half the day. Did something happen?” Yiye Jiange asked when Qing Shui took a seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I met the Mistress of Sunset Palace.” Qing Shui replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You met the Mistress of Sunset Palace? What did she say?” Muyun Qingge questioned in shock. If it had been anyone else, she would have assumed he was lying—it was difficult for strangers, especially men, to meet her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She said that if I’m willing to wed her, then she’ll withdraw all the forces and no longer pursue the matter with the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was stunned, then broke into a smile. “I realized you can spout words that are utterly unexpected sometimes. Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed this. Right, Jiange?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think he’s pretty smug at times.” Yiye Jiange said with a smile. Neither Qing Shui nor Muyun Qingge could guess what was on her mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head in resignation. Even when he spoke the truth, there would always be someone who didn’t believe him. “But I rejected her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I guessed it right this time.” Muyun Qingge said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, she gave another condition. A one-on-one duel tomorrow, and they’ll be sending the Silver Battle King Crab. If we win, they’ll withdraw temporarily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge pondered before speaking up again. “The Silver Battle King Crab is really powerful, even more so than the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King. They are natural warriors with exceptionally strong combat skills. However, forcing a retreat out of him shouldn’t be an issue. I’ll fight him this time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re the Palace Mistress of the Sea King’s Palace. It’ll be beneath your social status to fight.” Qing Shui smiled. Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange’s strength shouldn’t be inferior to the Silver Battle King Crab, but it was still hard to tell. They had both improved dramatically since when they fought against the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace, especially Yiye Jiange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also the Nine-Headed Crystal Beast. Back then, just by using the Nine-Headed Crystal Beast, they were able to scarcely defend themselves against an opponent on the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s level. Now that their strength had increased this much, perhaps the Nine-Headed Crystal Beast would be able to hitch a victory against Silver Battle King Crab.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was just his speculation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then who do you think will be a suitable candidate to fight?” Muyun Qingge looked towards Qing Shui as she asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me.” He smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re the Guardian of Sea King’s Palace. You can’t get into just any battle you please either. If you were going to do it anyway, then you might as well let me do it.” Muyun Qingge frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s different. As a Guardian, I have yet to develop a reputation; there are many out there who don’t even know of my existence. Which is why, as a Guardian, I will need to participate in battles in order to declare my existence, and prove that I have the ability to protect.” Qing Shui maintained his smile as he said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That sounds good. I have faith in your strength.” Muyun Qingge conceded eventually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange, on the other hand, turned her focus towards Qing Shui. “Be careful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, there aren’t many who can kill me now. My greatest strength lies in the fact that I can survive even through the worst beatings.” Qing Shui reassured her through this earnest statement that was somehow also a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t long before the news spread: the Guardian of the Sea King’s Palace would be battling the Silver Battle King Crab of Sunset Palace tomorrow. The Sunset Palace would retreat upon defeat, however, if the Sea King’s Palace failed in defeating their opponent, then they couldn’t blame Sunset Palace for being discourteous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, retaliation was always an option.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are your thoughts about the Guardian of our Sea King’s Palace?” Among the martial artists gathered in Sea King’s Palace, someone spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our Guardian is the youngest and also the one with the most potential. Even the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King and the Golden Sea-Dragon Merman died in his hands.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. I am optimistic about our Guardian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve heard that Silver Battle King Crab of Sunset Palace is from an ancient bloodline. Its might is terrifying. This will be a fierce battle.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Silver Battle King Crab is one of the many skilled warriors in the Sunset Palace. It’s fortunate that it isn’t the Golden Battle King Crab that will be fighting this time. Otherwise, it’d be hard to tell. To be honest, the disparity in might between the Sea King’s Palace and the Sunset Palace is quite large.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While those warriors were speculating, Qing Shui was entangled with Yiye Jiange. He was head over heels for this gorgeously delicate body. Their soft moans continued filling the air around them as their sweet melody rushed into his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kissed her body over and over again and the intimacy soon led them to their peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was already late into the night when the room quietened down. Yiye Jiange was curled up in Qing Shui’s embrace, her beautiful face donning a blissful expression.&nbsp;</span></p>

Why don’t you let me fight instead?” Yiye Jiange’s dazed eyes found their way to Qing Shui.</span></p>

Regardless of what happens in the future, I’ll be the one shielding you.”&nbsp;</span></p>

It was from then on that he told himself he would do the same for her regardless of the situation. &nbsp;</span></p>

The docile look on her face was the insatiable spark that caused Qing Shui to go off once more…&nbsp;</span></p>

They chatted with each other until daybreak before deciding to get up.&nbsp;</span></p>

They could see each other at this moment. The Aquatics had exceptional sight in water, and for Qing Shui, his Paragon Water Shield allowed him to see just as well as them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t long before a burly man appeared from the opposite side. His figure was peculiar—both his legs were split into two all the way to his knees, and his arms were also split up to the elbow. He was at least three metres in height, having a snow-white body that appeared to have eight limbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Silver Battle King Crab, an ancient battle crab. It was one that resembled a person in Qing Shui’s perspective, but not entirely. Seeing it in person, Qing Shui no longer regarded it as a human in the depths of his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>

His voice rang like metal, and his body seemed to be clad in metal-like scales as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Qing Shui gave him a once over while he responded.</span></p>

How laughable.” The Silver Battle King Crab’s voice was thickly coated with scorn.</span></p>

There weren’t many who could anger him, and likewise, this was hardly a big deal.</span></p>

I’m going to have a drink when I’m done here. I told them to go ahead without me. I’m going to catch up with them after this.”</span></p>

It was then that he noticed the four weapons in his opponent’s hand.</span></p>

It was no wonder the Silver Battle King Crab was the descendant of the ancient battle bloodline; not just anyone would be able to use this many weapons at once.&nbsp;</span></p>

With a shift of Qing Shui’s conscious mind, the Nine Continents Mountain appeared, rushing towards the Silver Battle King Crab in an attempt to crush him.</span></p>

The body of the Silver Battle King Crab glimmered and his huge body moved forward with the movements of his four muscular limbs. In incomparable queerness, he swam towards Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>

At the same time, Qing Shui waved his hand and gathered a gigantic Thorn of Earth, sending it piercing towards the Silver Battle King Crab’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
