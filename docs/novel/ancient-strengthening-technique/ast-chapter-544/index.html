 <p><strong>Chapter 544 Taking The Wind Water Primordial Pellet, Looking For The Turning Point?.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 544 - Taking The Wind Water Primordial Pellet, Looking For The Turning Point?</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now that all the ingredients were gathered, he could now work on refining the Wind Water Primordial Pellet. Qing Shui could not help but fall into a daze. He realized that he was getting closer and closer to the Martial Saint level.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Medicinal pill!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was why alchemists were highly respected, especially powerful alchemists. They could refine those heavenly and earthly treasures for their own use!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was still plenty of time and Qing Shui felt extremely energized. This could be because of the Tri-Acupoint Clearing Pellet. Qing Shui had not expected that the effect of this pellet was so strong, otherwise, he would have refined it long ago.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stored the last remaining one away safely and casually walked around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The realm did not go through an upgrade after he had done the deed with Canghai Mingyue previously, but what that had astonished Qing Shui was that a Yin-Yang fish the size of a golden colored walnut had appeared on the image of Yin-Yang in his consciousness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw that, he was very shocked and even felt a bit unease. However, when he noticed that the golden colored light exuded had increased by a little, he knew that it was not anything bad and thus did not put too much thought into it. He just did not know why it had suddenly appeared after he had sex with Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That seed grew into a seedling like a fire at a very slow pace. It was very hard to see its growth at all. Qing Shui did not feel that it was strange. Since it took so long to germinate, it was normal for it to take a long time to grow as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cultivating, continuing his journey, then cultivating, then continuing on his journey.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Fire Bird's speed was very fast and after one month of traveling, he would be able to reach the Hundred Miles City in just another two days. During this period of time, Qing Shui only refined some Constitution Nurturing Pill, Bone Strengthening Pill, and Tri-Acupoint Clearing Pellets. Out of all three, the Tri-Acupoint Clearing Pellets were the least in quantity with only over 30 of them. Thank goodness that each person could only take one of this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were more Constitution Nurturing Pill and Bone Strengthening Pill!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He did not refine the Wind Water Primordial Pellet during this time. Qing Shui felt that his mind was not calm and thus delayed it for over a month. Only when he was about to reach the Hundred Miles City did he manage to settle down his emotions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wind Water Primordial Pellet: Agility-Enhancing Fruit (Clear Wind Fruit), Beast Pill, Nine Fragrance Worm, Peach of Immortality, White Frost Nectar, Canfeng Dewdrops, Nine-Winged Golden Cicada, Inner Core of a 1000-year demonic beast, 1000-year Fluoritum, 2000-year Lingzhi, 2000-year Earth Essence, Golden Horn Firetail Fish, Small Revitalizing Pellet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui first tempered the Nine-Winged Golden Cicada. This Nine-Winged Golden Cicada which was only the size of a human head had an age of 3500 to 4000 years old. Although it was small in size, it was perfectly formed, with the Core and everything else.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now that it was to be used for alchemy, he needed to temper the whole thing until it was melted. He would then start to add in the Nine Fragrance Worm!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Next, he added the Clear Wind Fruit and Beauty Fruit, roasting over the Primordial Flames for an hour before he added in a piece of demonic beast's Core. He used the Core of that big tiger with the wind attribute.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the blink of an eye, three days passed. Just a moment ago, Qing Shui had added in the last Small Revitalizing Pellet, only then had he calmed down a little. The earlier phases had a high tendency to fail easily since he was required to add in some materials after a short interval each time. With more ingredients added in, if it was unstable, the chances of the cauldron exploding was very high.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very quickly, and six days vanished in the blink of an eye!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's current primordial flames were kept very small, gently heating up the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. However, the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron let out an agitated "whistling" sound.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ding!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the sharp sound rang out, Qing Shui opened his eyes. However, he did not stop the primordial flames. He only increased the heat till the flames were about three inches tall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">About an hour later, the flames were once again to lowered to just half an inch tall. It was maintained in this state for a whole six hours and the flames could not be seen at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then fell asleep on the floor just like that. Although it had only been nine days, it was the most energy consuming period.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt as if he had slept for a whole twenty hours. After about one day and one night, the first thing Qing Shui did when he woke up was to open the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Two, two....</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was the first time Qing Shui prayed for the number of medicinal pills to appear. However, when he opened it, he saw one medicinal pill which had a white like the color of the moon. It gleamed with a pure crystal light.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Be satisfied!" Qing Shui smiled and consoled himself!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effect: Increase overall abilities by 30%; gain 10% chance to increase the experience gained for all the martial arts by 1%; clears the Yong Quan acupoint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the effect of the Wind Water Primordial Pellet. Qing Shui was truly agitated. The effects which would increase one's abilities by 30% was tremendous. Qing Shui did not know if he could enter the door leading to the Martial Saint level in just one go.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moreover, it also had an effect which made Qing Shui very excited, which was to clear the Yong Quan Acupoint. The Yong Quan Acupoint was a very important acupoint and even Di Chen who had been cultivating the [Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs] for so long, and was showing high chances of clearing the acupoint, had not succeeded even after over 4 years. It seemed like it was really not easy to clear this acupoint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But the benefits which came with the clearing of this acupoint was also tremendous, which was increasing one's speed in leaps and bounds. The exhaustion of the Qi of Xiantian would also be reduced. This was the benefits which accompanied the clearing of a major acupoint in the human body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It would improve a specific ability in leaps and bounds, and the improvement would also reduce the exhaustion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, the trend was that, no matter what martial technique it was, the greater the prowess, the greater the exhaustion. There were many martial arts which most people would stay away from since they would not be able to even unleash an attack even if they were to exhaust all of their strength. Moreover, the cultivation was also extremely difficult.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, a little agitated, took thee Wind Water Primordial Pellet. A few breaths later, an immense strength he had never felt before surged in from the Baihui Acupoint on the top of his head, flowing into his Dantian through the meridian channels. If Qing Shui's meridian channels and Dantian were not strong enough, he suspected that he would explode and die.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was now fully focused only on the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Also, the Diamond Qi, Frenzied Bull's Strength, Emperor's Qi, Heavenly Thunder Slash and Diamond Qi... were all frantically circulated!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the discomfort from the bloating of his Dantian and thus thought of exhausting a tremendous amount of his energy to maintain a balance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, he discovered that it was useless. Not only did the bloating from his Dantian feel uncomfortable, it was the same for his meridian channels as well. Qing Shui felt that his whole body was swelled up and uncomfortable. The feeling was comparable to experiencing pain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was slightly stuffy and his consciousness also felt a little blurry!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pfft!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just as Qing Shui was feeling at a loss, a crisp sound rang out. It was as if the forces in his body had found an exit, dashing out and soon formed a cycle around his two legs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His feet felt very strong as if there was an endless supply of energy. A new force cycle was formed and the "mouth of the spring" was the Yong Quan Acupoint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was an independent cycle, increasing the strength and speed of his legs by at least two times. His overall abilities were increased by 30% and Qing Shui's strength had increased by two and a half countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's strength now reached ten countries, his defenses at fourteen-plus countries, his speed had also increased to two times his original. Now, even if his speed could not match one who's cultivation level was at ten countries, it would be very close.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, the ability that came with the clearing of the Yong Quan Acupoint was about the same as the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's 金刚渡水!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body's recovery exceeded ten countries, his internal organs’ toughness should also have exceeded ten countries. His spirit energy should also have reached the targets. But why had he still not broke through to Martial Saint level...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought very hard. Could it be that he really needed a turning point? Needed that Five Phases Heavenly Fruit?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could it be that he had repeatedly taken medicinal pills and thus resulted in his cultivation being unstable?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Fire Bird gradually landed in Hundred Miles City. Qing Shui decided not to think about this troublesome question and decided to turn to think about how to enter the 6th Heavenly Layer rather than thinking about how to attain Martial Saint level.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The increase brought by the medicinal pill came very quickly, but the foundations would tend to be unstable. Therefore, Qing Shui planned to continue tempering his body, especially through practicing Taichi in the morning.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's return to Qing Clan gave everyone a great surprise. No one had expected him to come back since the Heavenly Palace was too far from Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Daddy!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Daddy!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Shui!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yuchang and Luan Luan ran over!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried the two of them, one in each hand. From a distance away, Qing Bei pouted as she looked at Qing Shui. But when she saw the two pretty lasses in Qing Shui's arms, she could only sigh speechlessly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw Luan Luan, his eyes lit up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Xiantian?" Qing Shui looked toward Yiye Jiange in surprise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange smiled and nodded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"A ten-year-old Xiantian cultivator!" Qing Shui chuckled and then looked toward Qing Bei who was a short distance away. He then realized that Qing Bei had also attained Xiantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Little Bei has also broken through to the Xiantian level now!" Qing Shui was truly very happy. It was Qing Clan's first Xiantian across three generations. For his case, since he had some lucky encounters, it should not be factored into consideration.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I was slower than Luan Luan by two months. She broke through at the start of the year, while for me, it was at the later part of the year." When Qing Bei was sharing about her breakthrough to the Xiantian level, she was extremely excited.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was very surprised that Yiye Jiange was still at Qing Clan. He had thought that after he’d left, she would bring Luan Luan back to Skysword Sect. However, when Qing Shui looked at this intelligent lass in his arms, he felt that the problem could possibly lie with her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mother!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried the two lasses and smiled as he walked up to Qing Yi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Come, let's go home first. Then we can talk." Qing Yi took Yuchang from him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The family headed toward the living room. After hearing that Qing Shui was back, everyone in Qing Clan came back too. Of course, Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan did not appear.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui, I've been at the pinnacle of Houtian for such a long period of time but have not been able to achieve a breakthrough. You must help me. Even Qing Bei has attained a breakthrough two months ago." Qing You looked at Qing Shui bitterly, his aggrieved expression caused Qing Shui to have goosebumps.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You're just lacking the turning point. Take this. Take one of it every half a month and then don't do anything except practice the Back Connecting Fist to temper the body." Qing Shui took out two small bottles of Constitution Nurturing Pills and Bone Strengthening Pills and tossed it to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had tried them. The Bone Strengthening Pill could increase the strength and density of the bones, thus increasing one's ability to stand up against impact. The Constitution Nurturing Pill, on the other hand, nurtures the constitution and the benefits were more internal. It would not show any benefits on the surface, or rather, one would not be able to sense the tremendous benefits it would bring right from the start.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It will allow the person who took it to strengthen his foundations, tempering the body and increasing the Qi of Xiantian's level of purity and density of a person. However, it had no effect for people like Qing Shui. It might be because the quality was bad, but to a Xiantian, or especially for Houtian cultivators, the effects were extremely good.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Daddy, I want too!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I want too!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the stock he had kept aside to them. After all, he had planned to give it to them to begin with!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">There were more Constitution Nurturing Pill and Bone Strengthening Pill!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He did not refine the Wind Water Primordial Pellet during this time. Qing Shui felt that his mind was not calm and thus delayed it for over a month. Only when he was about to reach the Hundred Miles City did he manage to settle down his emotions.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wind Water Primordial Pellet: Agility-Enhancing Fruit (Clear Wind Fruit), Beast Pill, Nine Fragrance Worm, Peach of Immortality, White Frost Nectar, Canfeng Dewdrops, Nine-Winged Golden Cicada, Inner Core of a 1000-year demonic beast, 1000-year Fluoritum, 2000-year Lingzhi, 2000-year Earth Essence, Golden Horn Firetail Fish, Small Revitalizing Pellet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui first tempered the Nine-Winged Golden Cicada. This Nine-Winged Golden Cicada which was only the size of a human head had an age of 3500 to 4000 years old. Although it was small in size, it was perfectly formed, with the Core and everything else.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But now that it was to be used for alchemy, he needed to temper the whole thing until it was melted. He would then start to add in the Nine Fragrance Worm!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Next, he added the Clear Wind Fruit and Beauty Fruit, roasting over the Primordial Flames for an hour before he added in a piece of demonic beast's Core. He used the Core of that big tiger with the wind attribute.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the blink of an eye, three days passed. Just a moment ago, Qing Shui had added in the last Small Revitalizing Pellet, only then had he calmed down a little. The earlier phases had a high tendency to fail easily since he was required to add in some materials after a short interval each time. With more ingredients added in, if it was unstable, the chances of the cauldron exploding was very high.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very quickly, and six days vanished in the blink of an eye!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's current primordial flames were kept very small, gently heating up the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. However, the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron let out an agitated "whistling" sound.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ding!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the sharp sound rang out, Qing Shui opened his eyes. However, he did not stop the primordial flames. He only increased the heat till the flames were about three inches tall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">About an hour later, the flames were once again to lowered to just half an inch tall. It was maintained in this state for a whole six hours and the flames could not be seen at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then fell asleep on the floor just like that. Although it had only been nine days, it was the most energy consuming period.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt as if he had slept for a whole twenty hours. After about one day and one night, the first thing Qing Shui did when he woke up was to open the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Two, two....</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was the first time Qing Shui prayed for the number of medicinal pills to appear. However, when he opened it, he saw one medicinal pill which had a white like the color of the moon. It gleamed with a pure crystal light.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Be satisfied!" Qing Shui smiled and consoled himself!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effect: Increase overall abilities by 30%; gain 10% chance to increase the experience gained for all the martial arts by 1%; clears the Yong Quan acupoint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the effect of the Wind Water Primordial Pellet. Qing Shui was truly agitated. The effects which would increase one's abilities by 30% was tremendous. Qing Shui did not know if he could enter the door leading to the Martial Saint level in just one go.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moreover, it also had an effect which made Qing Shui very excited, which was to clear the Yong Quan Acupoint. The Yong Quan Acupoint was a very important acupoint and even Di Chen who had been cultivating the [Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs] for so long, and was showing high chances of clearing the acupoint, had not succeeded even after over 4 years. It seemed like it was really not easy to clear this acupoint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But the benefits which came with the clearing of this acupoint was also tremendous, which was increasing one's speed in leaps and bounds. The exhaustion of the Qi of Xiantian would also be reduced. This was the benefits which accompanied the clearing of a major acupoint in the human body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It would improve a specific ability in leaps and bounds, and the improvement would also reduce the exhaustion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, the trend was that, no matter what martial technique it was, the greater the prowess, the greater the exhaustion. There were many martial arts which most people would stay away from since they would not be able to even unleash an attack even if they were to exhaust all of their strength. Moreover, the cultivation was also extremely difficult.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, a little agitated, took thee Wind Water Primordial Pellet. A few breaths later, an immense strength he had never felt before surged in from the Baihui Acupoint on the top of his head, flowing into his Dantian through the meridian channels. If Qing Shui's meridian channels and Dantian were not strong enough, he suspected that he would explode and die.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was now fully focused only on the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Also, the Diamond Qi, Frenzied Bull's Strength, Emperor's Qi, Heavenly Thunder Slash and Diamond Qi... were all frantically circulated!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the discomfort from the bloating of his Dantian and thus thought of exhausting a tremendous amount of his energy to maintain a balance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, he discovered that it was useless. Not only did the bloating from his Dantian feel uncomfortable, it was the same for his meridian channels as well. Qing Shui felt that his whole body was swelled up and uncomfortable. The feeling was comparable to experiencing pain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was slightly stuffy and his consciousness also felt a little blurry!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pfft!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just as Qing Shui was feeling at a loss, a crisp sound rang out. It was as if the forces in his body had found an exit, dashing out and soon formed a cycle around his two legs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His feet felt very strong as if there was an endless supply of energy. A new force cycle was formed and the "mouth of the spring" was the Yong Quan Acupoint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was an independent cycle, increasing the strength and speed of his legs by at least two times. His overall abilities were increased by 30% and Qing Shui's strength had increased by two and a half countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's strength now reached ten countries, his defenses at fourteen-plus countries, his speed had also increased to two times his original. Now, even if his speed could not match one who's cultivation level was at ten countries, it would be very close.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time around, the ability that came with the clearing of the Yong Quan Acupoint was about the same as the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's 金刚渡水!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His body's recovery exceeded ten countries, his internal organs’ toughness should also have exceeded ten countries. His spirit energy should also have reached the targets. But why had he still not broke through to Martial Saint level...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought very hard. Could it be that he really needed a turning point? Needed that Five Phases Heavenly Fruit?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Could it be that he had repeatedly taken medicinal pills and thus resulted in his cultivation being unstable?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Fire Bird gradually landed in Hundred Miles City. Qing Shui decided not to think about this troublesome question and decided to turn to think about how to enter the 6th Heavenly Layer rather than thinking about how to attain Martial Saint level.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The increase brought by the medicinal pill came very quickly, but the foundations would tend to be unstable. Therefore, Qing Shui planned to continue tempering his body, especially through practicing Taichi in the morning.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's return to Qing Clan gave everyone a great surprise. No one had expected him to come back since the Heavenly Palace was too far from Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Daddy!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Daddy!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Shui!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yuchang and Luan Luan ran over!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried the two of them, one in each hand. From a distance away, Qing Bei pouted as she looked at Qing Shui. But when she saw the two pretty lasses in Qing Shui's arms, she could only sigh speechlessly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw Luan Luan, his eyes lit up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Xiantian?" Qing Shui looked toward Yiye Jiange in surprise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"A ten-year-old Xiantian cultivator!" Qing Shui chuckled and then looked toward Qing Bei who was a short distance away. He then realized that Qing Bei had also attained Xiantian.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Little Bei has also broken through to the Xiantian level now!" Qing Shui was truly very happy. It was Qing Clan's first Xiantian across three generations. For his case, since he had some lucky encounters, it should not be factored into consideration.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I was slower than Luan Luan by two months. She broke through at the start of the year, while for me, it was at the later part of the year." When Qing Bei was sharing about her breakthrough to the Xiantian level, she was extremely excited.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was very surprised that Yiye Jiange was still at Qing Clan. He had thought that after he’d left, she would bring Luan Luan back to Skysword Sect. However, when Qing Shui looked at this intelligent lass in his arms, he felt that the problem could possibly lie with her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mother!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried the two lasses and smiled as he walked up to Qing Yi.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Come, let's go home first. Then we can talk." Qing Yi took Yuchang from him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The family headed toward the living room. After hearing that Qing Shui was back, everyone in Qing Clan came back too. Of course, Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan did not appear.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui, I've been at the pinnacle of Houtian for such a long period of time but have not been able to achieve a breakthrough. You must help me. Even Qing Bei has attained a breakthrough two months ago." Qing You looked at Qing Shui bitterly, his aggrieved expression caused Qing Shui to have goosebumps.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You're just lacking the turning point. Take this. Take one of it every half a month and then don't do anything except practice the Back Connecting Fist to temper the body." Qing Shui took out two small bottles of Constitution Nurturing Pills and Bone Strengthening Pills and tossed it to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had tried them. The Bone Strengthening Pill could increase the strength and density of the bones, thus increasing one's ability to stand up against impact. The Constitution Nurturing Pill, on the other hand, nurtures the constitution and the benefits were more internal. It would not show any benefits on the surface, or rather, one would not be able to sense the tremendous benefits it would bring right from the start.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It will allow the person who took it to strengthen his foundations, tempering the body and increasing the Qi of Xiantian's level of purity and density of a person. However, it had no effect for people like Qing Shui. It might be because the quality was bad, but to a Xiantian, or especially for Houtian cultivators, the effects were extremely good.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Daddy, I want too!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I want too!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the stock he had kept aside to them. After all, he had planned to give it to them to begin with!</p>
