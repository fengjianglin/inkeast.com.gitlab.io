By now, Qing Shui along with the two women came out. Out of all ten warriors, two were exquisitely beautiful women, but unfortunately, they were both with Qing Shui, so a lot of people were upset about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the ten people, two of them were from the Qiao Clan of Dazang City and Xicheng Clan of Xiyun City respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them had had conflicts with Qing Shui at one point, the Xicheng Clan in particular, but Qing Shui didn’t seem to really care about it. At the moment, he wasn’t even paying attention to any of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, how shall I address you? I am Lei Bao,” Lei Bao of the Great Sun Immortal Palace smiled as he said to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, nice to meet you,” Qing Shui replied politely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mr. Qing, thank you for being polite. Truth be told, I don’t think that I will stand a chance against you. I hope you can watch out for me.” Lei Bao smiled and said with a sincere tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Qu Bai of the Bright Moon Palace was also very shocked. He looked at Qing Shui before looking at Lei Bao. Even though he didn’t know Qing Shui, he understood Lei Bao well. He was a very straightforward person and would say whatever he had in his mind. He wouldn’t try to be fake and polite with others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Bao’s words caused him to look at Qing Shui very seriously. However, after looking for a while, he still didn’t manage to see through anything about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, two of the people from the Xicheng and Qiao clans also wanted to say something to Qing Shui, but at this moment, they both kept silent. They didn’t want to look for trouble for themselves as it was not strange at all to die in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lei, please don’t act so formally. Since we are already here, we don’t know what danger lies ahead. It is better if we look after each other, as it might take all of us working together to make sure that we can get back safely.” Qing Shui was reluctant to continue arguing with these people. He would rather spend the time searching for some good stuff around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true. However, I wonder if the others also share the same opinion as us?” Lei Bao looked at the people around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s good if we stick together, but the ‘together’ in this context means being together in the same area. For example, today, we will stay in this area. When it comes to searching for treasures, each of us can do it separately. However, if any of us run into danger, we can send out a signal to alert the others. What’s your thought on this?” Qu Bai smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s for the best. We can look after each other but at the same time also not fight over the things we find.“ Lei Bao smiled and said. He immediately glanced towards Qing Shui the moment he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I also feel that this is for the best.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great, it’s settled then. Today, we will treasure hunt in this area, and tomorrow we will gather up in the area that is five hundred lis away from here. Does this sound like a good idea for all of you?” Lei Bao said after thinking for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others also gestured their lack of objections against it. After getting to know each other for a while, they dispersed. Two or three of them would move in a small group together and look around for some treasures. However, Qing Shui knew that everything that was said before was only a sign of formality. If they really got into danger, they shouldn’t count on anyone providing aid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were still envious of Qing Shui since he had the two women with him. After all, Beiming Xue was the most beautiful woman across the Northern Ice Domain. In fact, the entire Northern Underworld Immortal Palace was not as well-known as her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was near the edge of the land. Thus, there weren’t many dangers to be encountered. However, areas that were two thousand lis away from this point would be teeming with great dangers. It wouldn’t be weird if one died there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s look around. The scenery here is quite nice.” Yu Xixuan smiled and said while looking at the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scenery here was indeed pleasing. It was blooming with fresh flower and was covered with grass. There were a lot of different birds and the surrounding air was fresh and fragrant. As the sun shone down from the sky, they could feel a sense of warmth, making them unusually comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Since we are here, we also need to look for some decent stuff. Otherwise, we would have wasted the opportunity of getting here.” Qing Shui smiled and said before he summoned the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast was slightly bigger than an elephant from his previous incarnation. Qing Shui looked at the two girls as soon as he sat onto it, “Would you like to join me up here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short moment of shock, Yu Xixuan immediately sat beside Qing Shui. Beiming Xue hesitated for a while and proceeded to sit on Qing Shui’s other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The back of the Dragon Slaying Beast wasn’t actually that wide, but it was enough to let the three of them sit next to each other. This was because all three of them had powerful cultivations. If they had been ordinary people, they wouldn’t have been able to do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faint fragrances went into Qing Shui’s nose. These fragrances consisted of two different kinds of smell, being very alluring on their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beiming Xue was at a bit of a loss while sitting next to Qing Shui. Why was she sitting beside him? She was a bit panicked sensing the aura of a man up close. This was something which had never happened to her before. However, since she was already sitting there, she didn’t like to cower before others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast was also a treasure-hunting beast. Hence, Qing Shui left the task of searching for treasures to the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a while, they managed to find a decent medicinal herb, the Jade Lotus Flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the beginning, the two girls didn’t notice anything, but under the guidance of the Dragon Slaying Beast, they managed to find some decent stuff, and most of them were unusual medicinal herbs and fruits. They were all ingredients for medicines refinement. By now, they had also noticed that the beast they were currently riding on was a Treasure-hunting Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Treasure-hunting Beasts were more precious than a few Divine Grade warriors together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day passed just like that. They didn’t find any heaven-defying treasures, but managed to find some medicinal herbs. Qing Shui asked them if they needed them, and both declined. Qing Shui further mentioned that he was an alchemist and needed the herbs before keeping them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you really an alchemist?” Beiming Xue asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan and her could both sense how fearsome Qing Shui’s power was. In addition to that, he said that he was a physician, and later on added that he was also an alchemist. Thus, they were quite surprised by what he was capable of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Physicians and alchemists were closely linked to each other, but at the same time, it could also be considered as two different routes. A lot of physicians focused on treating people whereas alchemists were responsible for refining medicines. Both of them might be linked to one another, but they weren’t from the same field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to physicians, alchemists were even more mysterious and seemed very powerful. This was because physicians started at a lower level. A lot of ordinary men could be physicians, but becoming an Alchemist was a different story. A person must be at least at the Xiantian Realm to be an alchemist. It was at the Xiantian Realm that a person would attain the Flame of Xiantian and start being able to refine medicinal pills.</span></p>

In fact, I am a very powerful alchemist. At least for the time being, I have yet to see any alchemist who surpasses me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t believe you. A true alchemist would not act so arrogantly.” Beiming Xue smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because they are not confident of themselves.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, on the other hand, are overconfident of yourself.” After a day of interactions with Beiming Xue, Qing Shui had gotten quite close to her. Thus, coming up with some harmless jokes also helped to brighten up the mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about you take out the medicinal pills which you refined yourself and prove to us that you are truly a great alchemist.” Yu Xixuan smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. In any case, we are quite close with each other. It was not entirely unacceptable for me to give you guys some good luck.” Qing Shui smiled as he took out two Opportunity Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are the Opportunity Pills. How much you can gain out of them will depend on your luck. I just refined these recently.” At the moment, Qing Shui had a few Opportunity Pills with him. People were only allowed to take one in their lifetimes. Thus, there was no use in him saving them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This medicinal pill has abundant Spiritual Qi and also a fairly good appearance as well. I wonder if it truly is as mysterious as you said it to be.” Beiming Xue looked at the Opportunity Pill and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many ordinary medicinal pills with good outer appearance. At the same time, good medicinal pills also wouldn’t reveal their Spiritual Qi from the way they looked. Thus, it was very difficult to judge whether a medicinal pill was good or bad by how it looked, unless the person observing it was a powerful alchemist or someone with good innate talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky was turning dark. They camped in a mountain cave to rest for the day. Or rather, it could only be referred to as a small area on the surface of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls didn’t doubt Qing Shui, so they ate the Opportunity Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an hour, both of the girls looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. Their strength had surpassed ten billion Dao Force. However, they didn’t get to break through to the Eighth Divine Grade. It seemed that there was still a long way to go before they could break through from the late-stage of the Seventh level of Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls were already at the late-stage of the Seventh level of Divinity before this. Now, despite their strength being two times mightier, they still didn’t get the opportunity to break through to the Eighth Divine Grade. Nevertheless, they were still quite satisfied with what they got.</span></p>
