Every time I go back, Luan Luan and the rest always look forward to seeing you return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sounds good, but if we go back, how do we face your mother and the rest?” Although Yiye Jiange and Qing Shui previously had a murky relationship, they did not break through the last barrier of relationships. So When they were husband and wife back home, it was only because of Luan Luan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, they didn’t think about it so much. Thus, it didn’t matter to them if others assumed they had a relationship. Ever since Luan Luan was young, they have always acted like a couple then. But right now, it actually turned into reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Turning something fake into reality - many things can turn out like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ve always been my wife and everyone at home knows. We even have a daughter.” Qing Shui chuckled as he enjoyed seeing Yiye Jiange blush in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone at home knows it was a lie and Luan Luan wasn’t that old then. How old were you when you left and bringing back a daughter that old, who would believe it? Also, everything became clear when my brother and sister-in-law came too.” Yiye Jiange said in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My mother couldn’t be more delighted if she knew such a great woman could become her son’s wife.”</span></p>

All these made Qing Shui feel that it was somehow linked to the mysterious Duo Cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, he didn’t continue helping Muyun Qingge raise her strength and bade her goodbye before leaving straight for Dancing Phoenix Continent with Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Returning back actually only needed a short amount of time and once they left Sea King Palace, Qing Shui immediately used Five Elements Divine Flags and reached Dancing Phoenix Continent’s Yehuang Guwu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Qing Shui’s marked position in Dancing Phoenix Continent. If he was alone, he could immediately appear beside Yehuang Guwu but since he brought Yiye Jiange with him, they could only reach Yehuang Country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go see some friends!” Qing Shui smiled at her and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soulsearch’s Imperial Cuisine Hall was doing well and he exclaimed delightedly upon seeing Qing Shui: “Old Brother, you’ve finally shown yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately taking Qing Shui to the top level, there remained his old room which was in exactly the same shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where’s sister-in-law and my godson?” Qing Shui laughed gaily as he didn’t see them. When Soulsearch’s son was born, Qing Shui was asked to be his godfather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t reject either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, no matter what, Soulsearch was not going to let Qing Shui leave and made sure that he stayed for a day. Qing Shui didn’t reject and immediately invited Old Man Puyang Qing and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Puyang Clan was just like family now, although in the future it might change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yao Qubing also improved a lot here and became Soulsearch’s right-hand man. His personality was very good, other than being a little haughty in the past, but after meeting Qing Shui, Soulsearch and Yuansu then realized he paled in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feast was sumptuous and there were no outsiders. Puyang Qing was stunned when he saw Qing Shui as he couldn’t discern his strength - it was unfathomable and he couldn’t even hazard a guess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Puyang Qing came, he brought a little lass and now she had already grown up quite a bit into a pure and exquisite little flower. Seeing Qing Shui, she happily greeted him: “Hello Uncle, I remember you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she was small, Puyang Qing used to brought her here to eat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui liked the little lass and regardless of whether Qing Long can marry her in the future, she was family no matter what and so he gave her a bangle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then introduced Yiye Jiange to them and even Puyang Qing couldn’t help but sigh. Why have all the most exemplary women under the skies gone to Qing Shui? They were all the most outstanding regardless of temperament or cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui said he would stay here for a night, he actually spent the whole night talking to Soulsearch and Puyang Qing while Yiye Jiange left with the little lass after the feast ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange bade them farewell and rushed towards the Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Nine Continents Steps and Hellfire Phoenix, it took them about two days. Leaning on the back of the Hellfire Phoenix, they felt a sense of comfort and enjoyment as they looked at the empty city which was as bright as the stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They say one’s state would raise or change depending on the person they interact with, just like turning red when coming into contact with cinnabar or turning black when coming into contact with ink. Qing Shui was different when he was in front of Yiye Jiange compared to when he was with Huoyun Liuli or Zhu Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huoyun Liuli was like a demoness and Qing Shui felt very flippant and loose in front of her. Basically, there was no pressure at all. Zhu Qing felt like a little girl while the likes of Canghai Mingyue, Yiye Jiange, and Tantai Lingyan gave him a little pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully Qing Shui’s adaptive ability was very strong. Now that he had broken into Divine, his self-confidence rose by a lot. Even with that said, his feelings for his women still hadn’t changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">\</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Being with you is really fun. Now I’ve finally found the joy of being a woman. I’m also a girl so, of course, I wish to have everything a girl should have.” Yiye Jiange murmured quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could feel it when other men looked at her. If it was not lust then it was resistance. The latter was because they knew that no matter what, they would not cross paths. This was what a sensible person would think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now that you’ve become a woman, do you feel blissful?” Qing Shui reached his hand into her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange’s delicate body shuddered and she gave Qing Shui the stink-eye. This vigorous bad egg was thinking about this all day long once he broke through the final barrier with her...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui touched his nose and said: “Very fragrant!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re a scumbag.” Yiye Jiange shook her head and smiled.</span></p>

She didn’t feel put-off and even felt happy on the inside. Was this love…?</span></p>

The entrance guards were hired by Qing Shui and they greeted him in surprise.</span></p>

Qing Teng and Qing Nuo were coming to three weeks old and they looked strangely at Qing Shui.</span></p>

Maybe it was due to her aura but the two boys who looked like jade carvings did not reject her at all.</span></p>

Luan Luan pounced towards Yiye Jiange upon seeing her.</span></p>

Seeing her family made her happy and she walked towards Yiye Tian to give him a hug: “Brother, I trust that both of you are well!”</span></p>

He was no longer small like he used to be. When they first saw him, he was around ten years old but he was a big kid now.</span></p>

Although he couldn’t be compared to Mingyue Gelou or Yehuang Guwu, he was still outstanding and seemed to have a great future.</span></p>

She was no longer that surprised since she had already thought of this day. Yiye Jiange was the benefactor of their clan and they’ve already known each other for almost thirty years. Twenty years ago, Qing Yi already thought that such a day might come but little did she expect that more than twenty years had gone by.</span></p>

I don’t know where this little brat got all these blessings from and now you two have to spend a lifetime paying it back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aunt, you’re teasing me.” Yiye Jiange said in embarrassment.</span></p>

If her guess was right, even after they got married, Yiye Jiange would probably not stay in the Qing Clan. Even if not many of his women remained here, she was still contented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange’s wedding banquet was set for a week later but they did not inform many people. This was Yiye Jiange’s intention while Qing Shui wasn’t keen on publicity either. When two people at this level of strength are in love, they no longer felt the need for such a display and that it was sufficient to inform only the closest friends and family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wedding banquet would still need to be grand since the guests are their friends. There were also many who came uninvited, like the Baima Clan. Qing Shui didn’t know what the status was between the Big Miss of Baima Clan and Qing Ming but he didn’t ask. All he did though, was tell his children to be responsible. Likewise, they shouldn’t provoke others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wedding banquet didn’t turn out to be the peace and quiet they had in mind since there wasn’t any space in the end. After all, it was a celebratory affair and anyone who came was a guest. Moreover, Qing Clan’s Imperial Cuisine Hall had accumulated plenty of karma and goodwill in this area and many came bearing a gift without even attending. Many were also ordinary folk who received the grace of the Qing Clan and while they came bearing gifts which were not special, it was the thought that counts.&nbsp;</span></p>
