 <p><strong>Chapter 565 Courting Death, Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 565 - Courting Death, Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mmm!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded. He glanced at the nameplate of the Di Clan's residence once again, as if he was confirming that Di Qing had arrived home before he left!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Helian Wei gazed at Qing Shui's back, his eyes narrowed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Don't go find trouble with him, or else you'd just die a meaningless death!" Di Qing warned as he headed for Di Clan's main door!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Why would I go look for trouble? Aren't we friends?" He revealed a hinting glance before following Di Qing to Di Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Due to the fact this was Seven Stars City, Qing Shui did not wish to stay here for an extended period of time. After all, this was where the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord was located. The Seven Stars Country was extremely vast and there was a population of tens of billions. Therefore, it was almost impossible to come across someone from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. However, Qing Shui still decided to leave. After all, his first goal was to look for an opportunity in order to achieve a breakthrough to the 6th Heavenly Layer.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Back in Xing Hai Country, Qing Shui had received a rough map of the Central Continent from the Qianyu Dingjun. In the end, Qianyu Dingjun decided on taking a look in a few countries nearby.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jade Sea Country</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the first country Qing Shui had decided to visit. This was due to the fact that he had heard of the unique existence which resided there, the Jade Sea. This was also what made Jade Sea Country famous.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Jade Sea Country was approximately two countries away from the Seven Stars Country and Xing Hai Country. If he were to take Fire Bird, it would only take him about a week to arrive. Confirming down his direction, Qing Shui rode Fire Bird and quickly left for Xing Hai Country's direction.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He left the Seven Stars City in the evening. In each Central Region, the cities were separated by a piece of barren land. Qing Shui had now arrived approximately a hundred li into the barren land.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother, please wait!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A clear voice rang out. Qing Shui smiled and gazed at the four pitch-black Harpy Eagles. Qing Shui had known for a while people were tailing behind him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowed down gradually and smiled at the four young men behind him. It was the four young men who were with Helian Wei previously. He sighed, "Since you guys came knocking on the door to court death, there's nothing I can do."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Harpy Eagle was considered a mutated beast, and it was also considered a Peak Xiantian demonic beast. However, its flying speed and endurance was astonishing, it was commonly used by members of reputable clans. However, a tamed Harpy Eagle's value in the market was approximately 300,000 silver.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The 4 Harpy Eagles silently surrounded Qing Shui. Although they were only at Peak Xiantian level, when their wings were spread out, there were about 10 meters long. Although they much smaller than Qing Shui's Fire Bird, a demonic beast's powers were not ranked by size!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a glance at the four men. Helian Wei was not around and these four's level were only about grade 5 Martial King. They were considered quite good for their age.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I wonder what is the reason you're looking for me?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's not convenient for us to talk here. Let's descend first." The young man with especially bright eyes suggested.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the young man quietly and then said, "We're all clear what are your motives for coming. No need to put on a facade anymore. I'll just say one thing, don't come courting death."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spoke casually as he smiled toward that intelligent looking young man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's words caused the others to frown. It was because they could not tell Qing Shui's cultivation level, and it was just like he was a person without any cultivation level at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Of course, they would not be so foolish to think that Qing Shui had no cultivation level at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Since brother is so straightforward, I'll get straight to the point. Young Master Helian hopes that you can stay away from Miss Di Qing. It would be best if you can return to Greencloud Continent and don't ever leave again." The young man with bright eyes gazed at Qing Shui, not blinking in the slightest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hahaha, idiots! I've already told you earlier, yet, you still refuse to leave. You really don't care for your life. A bunch of fools!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Do it!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After instructing, the young man abruptly released a lump of black stuff. The other three did the same concurrently, creating swooshing and explosive sounds.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A tremendous black-colored web fell from the sky and headed toward Qing Shui and the Fire Bird! The black fog with a weird smell also spread out very quickly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A strong surge of Nature Energy was sent out and the lump of black fog was forced to scatter outwards. However, that web was still gradually descending. The strong spiritual energy it released told Qing Shui that it was a treasure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's it! Leaving you guys alive is a sin in itself!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui waved his hand!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Buzz....</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui let out the hundred Jade Emperor Queen Bees out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, unleashing a deafening buzzing sound. All of them charged crazily towards the four pale-faced men. Even their Harpy Eagles were screeching out in panic.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that there was nothing they could do about it. Qing Shui and the Fire Bird dodged the big web which seemed like a giant black jade. He then looked at the four men who were completely wiped out in just an instant and at those four Harpy Eagles were killed, all of them were dropping down toward the ground.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All hundred of them were Martial Saint level demonic beasts which possessed great speed and excelled in poison. There were not many people below the Martial Saint level who would be able to fend off these hundred Jade Emperor Queen Bees.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called them back, feeling satisfied as he let the Fire Bird descend. Earlier, Qing Shui did not forcibly fend off that black-colored web since he had once read from the &lt;&lt;Poison Scriptures&gt;&gt; and learnt of the existence of a corrosive lustre which had an extremely strong corrosiveness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gazed at the Black Jade Web which had landed on the ground, it still had a very strong spiritual fluctuation to it. However, it was now just a very small lump!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He circulated Nature Energy throughout his body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He then reached out his hand to picked up this lump of web. Qing Shui was puzzled on how it was used until he felt an aura from it, just like a human's aura.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Divine Connection?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gazed at the black web in his hands in surprise. Divine Connection was a case where an item had been used for a prolonged period of time, eventually leading to a kind of bond forming between the object and the owner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For example with the Divine Weapon, other than it being extremely powerful, it could also form a Divine Connection, allowing a terrifying teamwork to be formed between the owner and the object.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was holding it, he even felt the spiritual rhythm it was exuding. Qing Shui felt that this object must definitely be extremely poisonous. But why was he not able to feel it now?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was overjoyed upon seeing its name. The things the Heavenly Vision Technique could tell the names of were generally very good items. Of course, there were exceptions as well. For example, there were items whose name could not be seen but yet they were still excellent stuff.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb: A web the legendary venomous Blackjade Poisonous Spider had made from condensing its life into the threads. It is extremely poisonous and has an extraordinary tenacity and corrosive characteristic.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It is not poisonous in its normal state, but once infused with Qi of Xiantian, it would activate the venom in the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb. The size of the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb was also related to the Qi of Xiantian infused.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It could be nurtured with venom and tempered with Qi of Xiantian!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui channeled the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique into it, and, immediately, the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb shot out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb opened up widely and covered up the two Harpy Eagles' corpses. Very quickly, they were dissolved into a puddle of dark liquid, but none of it touched the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Repeating the process, Qing Shui corroded the other corpses into liquid as well!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He then leapt onto the Fire Bird and headed for the Jade Sea Country. Standing on the Fire Bird's back as it flew at great speed, Qing Shui held onto the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb and continue to endlessly tempered it with the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When tempering, he was gentle like flowing water, and when he channeled in the energy, it similar to shooting a laser. Therefore, when he was tempering it, the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb did not expand and activate its venom.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a period of gentle tempering, Qing Shui felt that this web had become even more firm and had even greater expandability. As for the venom, it did not undergo any changes. This was nothing weird. He would need to nurture it with venom.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui also felt that this Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb should be a treasure like the Soulshake bell. After tempering it for a while, he had cleaned off the spiritual sense left behind by the previous owner of the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Chang`er is in trouble! The Poisonous Spiderweb's spiritual sense has been wiped off!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A middle-aged man in Seven Stars City's Tang Clan said to an elder.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Go investigate, do it fast!" The elder bellowed out furiously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Concurrently, in Sun Clan, Li Clan and Lu Clan, everyone received the news that something had happened to the few young men who were often seen together.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This news spread quickly to Helian Wei!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone knew that the four of them were often seen together with Helian Wei, and that they were still together the day before. Therefore, all four clans were straight to Helian, causing him to be in a shock. He knew that the four of them must have died, and it was in the hands of that young man. If he were to let the four clans find out that the deaths of their descendents were related to him, even Helian Clan would not be able to save him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, the only thing he could do was to pretend to be ignorant, insisting that he did not know anything!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brothers, please wait for a moment. I'll call Wei`er out and find out what had happened." Seeing that the four men from each clan had came, Helian Bo spoke as he led them to their seats.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Helian Wei was called over and he looked toward the four middle-aged men with a puzzled expression, "Uncles, may I know why you have called for me? If there's anything you need, you can just call me over."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Chang`er and the others are dead!" Tang Clan's middle-aged man spoke slowly as he glared at Helian Wei.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Helian Wei looked in disbelief at the middle-aged man who spoke up, and then at the others. He dropped to the floor, "Uncle! Tell me who did it! It's my fault... I didn't take good care of them!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Helian, we've disturbed you!" The few of them returned in disappointment. Now that things had came to this, there was nothing much they could say. The man from Tang Clan could not find any information from Helian Wei's eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moreover, Helian Wei and the others had quite a good relationship. If someone were to say that he had harmed them, even they would not believe it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After everyone had left, Helian Wei continued kneeling there while his father, Helian Bo gazed at his son in a daze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Speak up, who killed them?" His voice was very calm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It was the young man which Miss Di Qing had brought back from Greencloud Continent!" Helian Wei replied, his voice trembling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Were you the one who asked them to find trouble for that young man?" Helian Bo asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes, father!" Helian Wei's head lowered even more.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Wei`er, do you know what you've done wrong today?" Helian Bo walked up to Helian Wei and squatted down in front of him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I've caused their deaths."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"No, no. So what if they're dead? It's just a few lives." Helian Bo shook his head and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I implore father's guidance."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Bearing. You're still lacking in bearing and boldness. When I asked you earlier, you should have insisted that you do not know anything, just like what you did earlier, to adapt to the circumstance. Know what you want and see through the situation clearly. Only with this, would you be able to live longer."</p>

Confirming down his direction, Qing Shui rode Fire Bird and quickly left for Xing Hai Country's direction.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He left the Seven Stars City in the evening. In each Central Region, the cities were separated by a piece of barren land. Qing Shui had now arrived approximately a hundred li into the barren land.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother, please wait!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A clear voice rang out. Qing Shui smiled and gazed at the four pitch-black Harpy Eagles. Qing Shui had known for a while people were tailing behind him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowed down gradually and smiled at the four young men behind him. It was the four young men who were with Helian Wei previously. He sighed, "Since you guys came knocking on the door to court death, there's nothing I can do."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Harpy Eagle was considered a mutated beast, and it was also considered a Peak Xiantian demonic beast. However, its flying speed and endurance was astonishing, it was commonly used by members of reputable clans. However, a tamed Harpy Eagle's value in the market was approximately 300,000 silver.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The 4 Harpy Eagles silently surrounded Qing Shui. Although they were only at Peak Xiantian level, when their wings were spread out, there were about 10 meters long. Although they much smaller than Qing Shui's Fire Bird, a demonic beast's powers were not ranked by size!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a glance at the four men. Helian Wei was not around and these four's level were only about grade 5 Martial King. They were considered quite good for their age.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I wonder what is the reason you're looking for me?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's not convenient for us to talk here. Let's descend first." The young man with especially bright eyes suggested.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the young man quietly and then said, "We're all clear what are your motives for coming. No need to put on a facade anymore. I'll just say one thing, don't come courting death."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spoke casually as he smiled toward that intelligent looking young man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's words caused the others to frown. It was because they could not tell Qing Shui's cultivation level, and it was just like he was a person without any cultivation level at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Of course, they would not be so foolish to think that Qing Shui had no cultivation level at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Since brother is so straightforward, I'll get straight to the point. Young Master Helian hopes that you can stay away from Miss Di Qing. It would be best if you can return to Greencloud Continent and don't ever leave again." The young man with bright eyes gazed at Qing Shui, not blinking in the slightest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Hahaha, idiots! I've already told you earlier, yet, you still refuse to leave. You really don't care for your life. A bunch of fools!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Do it!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After instructing, the young man abruptly released a lump of black stuff. The other three did the same concurrently, creating swooshing and explosive sounds.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A tremendous black-colored web fell from the sky and headed toward Qing Shui and the Fire Bird! The black fog with a weird smell also spread out very quickly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A strong surge of Nature Energy was sent out and the lump of black fog was forced to scatter outwards. However, that web was still gradually descending. The strong spiritual energy it released told Qing Shui that it was a treasure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's it! Leaving you guys alive is a sin in itself!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui waved his hand!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Buzz....</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui let out the hundred Jade Emperor Queen Bees out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, unleashing a deafening buzzing sound. All of them charged crazily towards the four pale-faced men. Even their Harpy Eagles were screeching out in panic.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that there was nothing they could do about it. Qing Shui and the Fire Bird dodged the big web which seemed like a giant black jade. He then looked at the four men who were completely wiped out in just an instant and at those four Harpy Eagles were killed, all of them were dropping down toward the ground.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All hundred of them were Martial Saint level demonic beasts which possessed great speed and excelled in poison. There were not many people below the Martial Saint level who would be able to fend off these hundred Jade Emperor Queen Bees.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called them back, feeling satisfied as he let the Fire Bird descend. Earlier, Qing Shui did not forcibly fend off that black-colored web since he had once read from the &lt;&lt;Poison Scriptures&gt;&gt; and learnt of the existence of a corrosive lustre which had an extremely strong corrosiveness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gazed at the Black Jade Web which had landed on the ground, it still had a very strong spiritual fluctuation to it. However, it was now just a very small lump!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He circulated Nature Energy throughout his body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He then reached out his hand to picked up this lump of web. Qing Shui was puzzled on how it was used until he felt an aura from it, just like a human's aura.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Divine Connection?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gazed at the black web in his hands in surprise. Divine Connection was a case where an item had been used for a prolonged period of time, eventually leading to a kind of bond forming between the object and the owner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For example with the Divine Weapon, other than it being extremely powerful, it could also form a Divine Connection, allowing a terrifying teamwork to be formed between the owner and the object.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was holding it, he even felt the spiritual rhythm it was exuding. Qing Shui felt that this object must definitely be extremely poisonous. But why was he not able to feel it now?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was overjoyed upon seeing its name. The things the Heavenly Vision Technique could tell the names of were generally very good items. Of course, there were exceptions as well. For example, there were items whose name could not be seen but yet they were still excellent stuff.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb: A web the legendary venomous Blackjade Poisonous Spider had made from condensing its life into the threads. It is extremely poisonous and has an extraordinary tenacity and corrosive characteristic.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It is not poisonous in its normal state, but once infused with Qi of Xiantian, it would activate the venom in the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb. The size of the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb was also related to the Qi of Xiantian infused.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It could be nurtured with venom and tempered with Qi of Xiantian!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui channeled the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique into it, and, immediately, the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb shot out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb opened up widely and covered up the two Harpy Eagles' corpses. Very quickly, they were dissolved into a puddle of dark liquid, but none of it touched the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Repeating the process, Qing Shui corroded the other corpses into liquid as well!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He then leapt onto the Fire Bird and headed for the Jade Sea Country. Standing on the Fire Bird's back as it flew at great speed, Qing Shui held onto the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb and continue to endlessly tempered it with the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When tempering, he was gentle like flowing water, and when he channeled in the energy, it similar to shooting a laser. Therefore, when he was tempering it, the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb did not expand and activate its venom.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a period of gentle tempering, Qing Shui felt that this web had become even more firm and had even greater expandability. As for the venom, it did not undergo any changes. This was nothing weird. He would need to nurture it with venom.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui also felt that this Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb should be a treasure like the Soulshake bell. After tempering it for a while, he had cleaned off the spiritual sense left behind by the previous owner of the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Chang`er is in trouble! The Poisonous Spiderweb's spiritual sense has been wiped off!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A middle-aged man in Seven Stars City's Tang Clan said to an elder.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Go investigate, do it fast!" The elder bellowed out furiously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Concurrently, in Sun Clan, Li Clan and Lu Clan, everyone received the news that something had happened to the few young men who were often seen together.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This news spread quickly to Helian Wei!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone knew that the four of them were often seen together with Helian Wei, and that they were still together the day before. Therefore, all four clans were straight to Helian, causing him to be in a shock. He knew that the four of them must have died, and it was in the hands of that young man. If he were to let the four clans find out that the deaths of their descendents were related to him, even Helian Clan would not be able to save him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, the only thing he could do was to pretend to be ignorant, insisting that he did not know anything!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brothers, please wait for a moment. I'll call Wei`er out and find out what had happened." Seeing that the four men from each clan had came, Helian Bo spoke as he led them to their seats.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Helian Wei was called over and he looked toward the four middle-aged men with a puzzled expression, "Uncles, may I know why you have called for me? If there's anything you need, you can just call me over."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Chang`er and the others are dead!" Tang Clan's middle-aged man spoke slowly as he glared at Helian Wei.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Helian Wei looked in disbelief at the middle-aged man who spoke up, and then at the others. He dropped to the floor, "Uncle! Tell me who did it! It's my fault... I didn't take good care of them!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Helian, we've disturbed you!" The few of them returned in disappointment. Now that things had came to this, there was nothing much they could say. The man from Tang Clan could not find any information from Helian Wei's eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moreover, Helian Wei and the others had quite a good relationship. If someone were to say that he had harmed them, even they would not believe it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After everyone had left, Helian Wei continued kneeling there while his father, Helian Bo gazed at his son in a daze.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Speak up, who killed them?" His voice was very calm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It was the young man which Miss Di Qing had brought back from Greencloud Continent!" Helian Wei replied, his voice trembling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Were you the one who asked them to find trouble for that young man?" Helian Bo asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Yes, father!" Helian Wei's head lowered even more.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Wei`er, do you know what you've done wrong today?" Helian Bo walked up to Helian Wei and squatted down in front of him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I've caused their deaths."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"No, no. So what if they're dead? It's just a few lives." Helian Bo shook his head and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I implore father's guidance."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Bearing. You're still lacking in bearing and boldness. When I asked you earlier, you should have insisted that you do not know anything, just like what you did earlier, to adapt to the circumstance. Know what you want and see through the situation clearly. Only with this, would you be able to live longer."</p>
