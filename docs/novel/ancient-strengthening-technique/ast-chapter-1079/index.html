 <p><strong>AST 1079 - Grade Four Shield Attack, Sacred Object of Heaven and Earth, the Nine Continents Mountain of Sacred Spirit Grade, Enough to Traverse Across the Five Continents</strong></p>
 <p>On the left was a gray stone about the size of a foot. Its shape and appearance greatly resembled the mountains that Qing Shui saw outside, only smaller.</p>
 <p>Despite being only a foot in size, it exuded an oppressive aura that was as immense as a lofty mountain. It felt unusually thick and heavy. Most importantly, Qing Shui could sense a wave of impenetrable domineering aura from it.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui only took a glance at it, he could tell that this item was definitely not as simple as it appeared. His hand slowly reached out towards this ‘little mountain’ that was very ordinary looking. It had a very hard surface and was also abundant with Spiritual Qi. However, before the space of a single breath had passed, his hand that was on it was repelled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was shocked that this thing had such miraculous power. Unwilling to give up, he reached out to touch it once again. However, his hand was once again repelled. He tried a few more times and he got the same result every time.</p>
 <p>This was the same energy that the Shield Attack had. Qing Shui pondered for awhile before circulating the energy of his Shield Attack. However, he held back a little. After all, his objective wasn’t to repel this little mountain. Besides, his Shield Attack depended on the rate. Even though his Shield Attack was currently Grade Three, the chances for double damage was still extremely slim.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was only trying to resist the energy type that was akin to the Shield Attack. Otherwise, he felt that he wouldn’t be able to pick up this little mountain at all. He extended his arm once again with slight anticipation and placed it on the little mountain.</p>
 <p>A wave of intense Shield Attack energy channeled into Qing Shui’s body through the meridian in his hand. The energies seemed to resonate with each other. Qing Shui was surprised. Not only did it not repel his hand but that pure energy seemed to blend with Qing Shui’s energy. This subsequently strengthened Qing Shui’s Shield Attack energy as it quickly completed one full cycle in his body.</p>
 <p>Plop!</p>
 <p>The sound akin to a stone being dropped into water rang out. Qing Shui’s eyes widened. Just when Qing Shui was grasping in the dark, the Shield Attack that had been very difficult to breakthrough actually broke through.</p>
 <p>Grade Four Shield Attack. That wave of energy invasively gushed forth into his body. Its explosive force was so strong that it felt like it was enough to raze a big mountain to the ground. Qing Shui felt extremely pleasant right now. It felt as if his entire body was brimming with an explosive energy.</p>
 <p>The breakthrough of Shield Attack was quite a bit of a surprise to Qing Shui. He had really reaped a lot of benefits from coming all the way to the Ancient Ruins. No wonder so many people wanted to come in. Everyone would experience their own encounters and opportunities here.</p>
 <p>Feeling content, Qing Shui took a look at his Grade Four Shield Attack. Its capability was somewhat stronger than before. The amount of strength had also been increased by 10%. Furthermore, the probability of it occurring should be a lot higher now compared to before. Other than that, he had a hunch that the power of this Shield Attack was connected to this little mountain.</p>
 <p>“So heavy!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t help but exclaim these words when he exerted some force and tried to lift that little mountain. It was too heavy. Its weight seemed to have exceeded Qing Shui’s expectation. He was really curious about what this little mountain was made out of.</p>
 <p>With his Heavenly Vision Technique, Qing Shui was instantly stupefied the moment he saw the name.</p>
 <p>Sacred Object of Heaven and Earth, the Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>“Another Sacred Object of Heaven and Earth……” Qing Shui’s jaw dropped. His shock was indescribable.</p>
 <p>Sacred Object of Heaven and Earth, the Nine Continents Mountain, treasure type. The condensation of pure stones between Heaven and Earth that formed after absorbing the power essence of sun and moon over countless years. Treasure of Sacred Spirit Grade. Refine with own fresh blood prior to use.</p>
 <p>Just the simple line of ‘Sacred Spirit Grade’ was enough to daze Qing Shui. There were many types and grades among Sacred Objects. For instance, the Holy Bracelet could only be considered a Sacred Object of the lowest grade. Sacred Object Arhat Rosary Beads was obviously a level higher than the Holy Bracelet, while this Sacred Object of the Spirit Grade was another level higher than the Arhat Rosary Beads.</p>
 <p>He had never heard anything about Sacred Objects of Sacred Spirit Grade in the Five Continents yet. Even if rumor, it seemed like only one or two supreme sects had them. However, no one had really seen it with their own eyes before. In the end, people questioned the validity of these rumors. Eventually, no one ever mentioned them ever again.</p>
 <p>Walking until here, Qing Shui seemed to no longer feel the pressure of Heaven and Earth. The pressure of Heaven and Earth was no longer effective on people who could reach up to this point. Perhaps for this exact reason, there was no pressure present around this stone altar.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately stashed another object that resembled a book into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal without even checking its title. All he had to do now was to refine this Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>Using his own fresh blood to refine meant that this treasure required a blood sacrifice. It was a very normal way to use treasures of this grade.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Gold Essence Scissors that was usually used for cutting beast leathers. He placed his hand on the top of the Nine Continents Mountain and slashed across the large artery on his wrist with the scissors.</p>
 <p>Scalding fresh blood gushed forth and dripped onto the Nine Continents Mountain. His fresh blood was mixed with a trace of faint golden color. Although it wasn’t really visible and could be easily overlooked, this trace of goldness truly existed.</p>
 <p>The moment the scalding fresh blood came into contact with the Nine Continents Mountain, it disappeared without a trace. It was extremely strange, even for Qing Shui. He was feeling a little anxious in his heart. He feared that this was a trap.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui was able to convince himself otherwise very soon. That was because he had read all these through his Heavenly Vision Technique. It wasn’t likely to be false.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s face was already slightly pale. However, the Nine Continents Mountain was like a forever insatiable vampire. It greedily feasted upon his blood and it didn’t seem like it would be stopping anytime soon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui clenched his jaw and persevered. He even had a feeling that this had gone too far. This kind of ‘blood sacrifice’ was a little dangerous, even though it wasn’t normally life threatening. To put it simply, this was a higher leveled method of owner recognition compared to recognizing a master through blood.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t want to waste all the efforts he had put in. He raised the condition of his body to its peak. Even the Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness was rotating rapidly. At least this way, he could replenish the blood that he had lost, even if just a little.</p>
 <p>His brain suddenly dulled. Qing Shui was shocked. He was losing too much blood. Not even a powerful cultivator could take this because Qing Shui had already lost two-thirds of his fresh blood in his body by now. Coming to the World of the Nine Continents, there was no need to be surprised about this kind of situation.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was thinking if he should stop doing this, the Nine Continents Mountain on the stone altar suddenly stopped absorbing his blood. It shone in black, white, red, yellow and some other colors. The simple looking Nine Continents Mountain appeared to be more beautiful now. Qing Shui was using his thoughts to control his body so that his wound from earlier wouldn’t close up. But now that his blood was no longer needed, his wound healed very quickly.</p>
 <p>Before he could even take a good look at the Nine Continents Mountain that had turned more gorgeous, everything around him went dark. At that moment, it felt as if Qing Shui’s mind had completely stopped for a moment. In just a brief moment, Qing Shui hurriedly opened his eyes to scan his surroundings.</p>
 <p>The Four Continents were boundless. The mountain peak from earlier was gone. The sky had also disappeared. Yet he was still certain that this was where he was previously.</p>
 <p>“Huh? Where’s the Nine Continents Mountain? The temple?”</p>
 <p>Just when his thoughts flashed by, Qing Shui felt an extra heavy aura akin to that of a lofty mountain on his body, or more like a sensation.</p>
 <p>Inner Sight!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hurriedly used Inner Sight. The moment he looked at it, he was stunned. At first, he thought it was the ‘Nine Continents Mountain’ on the stone altar that had disappeared. However, he was actually within his own dantian. On top of that, he was just right below the golden Dan. Next, some thoughts related to the ‘Nine Continents Mountain’ emerged in Qing Shui’s mind.</p>
 <p>Sacred Object of Heaven and Earth, the Nine Continents Mountain, treasure type. The condensation of pure stones between Heaven and Earth that were formed after absorbing the power essence of sun and moon over countless years. Treasure of the Sacred Spirit Grade. Successfully refined.</p>
 <p>Increases physical strength by 10,000 Stars and spirit energy by 10,000 Stars…….</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui thought about the sensation he felt in every movement he made right now, it was probably due to the tremendous increase in his strength or difficulty to adapt. To think that the Sacred Spirit Grade Sacred Object of Heaven and Earth could actually increase his physical strength by that much without exploding his body….</p>
 <p>To the current Qing Shui, the true treasure was the increase in physical strength. His Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation could raise his strength that much as well, to the extent of a few ten thousands Stars. However, these were all based on his physical strength. So all this time, he was affected by his physical strength. This didn’t only apply to him, but actually also to all the cultivators in the World of Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>It should be known that Qing Shui’s physical strength didn’t even reach 700 Stars previously, yet it had achieved 10,000 Stars now. Even his spirit energy was only 10,000 Stars, after including the Heart of Roc at the large success stage but excluding Arhat Rosary Beads, Big Dipper Sword, Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, and Buddha’s True Eyes. His base spirit energy was about 1,000 Stars and it had only reached 10,000 Stars under the effects of those cultivation techniques and the Heart of Roc.</p>
 <p>To have his base spirit energy increased by 10,000 stars was like reaching heaven in a single leap. Just the Heart of Roc could increase his spirit energy by five folds. With other techniques such as the Superior Focused Concentration, he could further raise it by about two folds. In addition to the Heart of Roc, this meant that his spirit energy could be raised by seven folds. Right now, Qing Shui’s base spirit energy had already reached about 11,500 stars. This meant that even without the help of external forces including the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and Arhat Rosary Beads, his spirit energy was already 10,000 stars.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a long moment because he was really shocked by his current strength. His body and just the Big Dipper Sword alone was able to unleash the strength of more than 20,000 stars, nearly 30,000 stars. This meant that if his damage was doubled by chance, it would reach more than 50,000 stars. His spirit energy offensive power was even more shocking. It reached up to 240,000 stars.</p>
 <p>This was Qing Shui’s assumption. In order to prove his own assumption, he quickly tried it out. In addition to his Shield Attack that had broken through to Grade Four, he could unleash 29,000 Stars of strength. When the 20% chance of double damage occurs, he would be able to unleash nearly 60,000 Stars of strength.</p>
 <p>Brandishing his Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui felt like ripping the Heaven and Earth apart. This powerful strength made every bone in his body feel very pleasant.</p>
 <p>An explosive energy and a qi aura that could slash everything. He even felt that God was on his side. He had him go to the Lion King’s Ridge and the other Four Continents.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>The Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation didn’t only increase spirit energy, but also strength. Hence, this allowed Qing Shui’s strength to reach over a terrifying 170,000 Stars.</p>
 <p>If he was within the Five Continents, he could only exhibit less than 20,000 Stars under the laws of Heaven and Earth’s influence…….</p>
 <p>Then there was his spirit energy too. Qing Shui could hardly wait to use the Primordial Flame Dragons. He used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, Buddha's True Eyes and all that. The two Flame Dragons instantly became as thick as an adult’s waist and reached up to 100 meters long while exuding an aura that condemned even the Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>However, something felt off to Qing Shui because this type of power was only 120,000 Stars in strength. The Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation could increase his spirit energy by two folds and there was also Buddha’s True Eyes. So why was it only 120,000 Stars?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put away his Big Dipper Sword. With a wave of his hand, he unleashed the Primordial Flame Dragons. The outcome was still exactly the same as before. The Big Dipper Sword no longer had any affects on his spirit energy’s offensive power.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head. Perhaps the Five-Colored Stone had lost its affects, or was lacking in grade. Or it could also be that the Big Dipper Sword’s capability wasn’t sufficient anymore. With this, his physical offensive power had once again exceeded the spirit energy in the Ancient Ruins. But if he exited from here, he was confident that he could easily traverse the Five Continents with the Arhat Rosary Beads and without the laws of Heaven and Earth’s restriction.</p>
