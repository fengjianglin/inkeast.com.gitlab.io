 <p><strong>Chapter 89 Ice Princess, Shi Qingzhuang.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0089 – Ice Princess, Shi Qingzhuang</strong></p>
  <p><span style>While Qing Shui indulged himself in his fantasy, Shi Qingzhuang on the bed opened her pair of clear eyes. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style>Seeing that pair of clear and cold looking eyes, caused a stab of pain in his heart. In her eyes, there was only coldness and no other expressions. There was no joy, no anger, not even hatred.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She silently regarded Qing Shui, without blinking. Qing Shui could not look her in the eyes, as he felt guilty for what he had done.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You must be hungry, let me get some soup for you!” Qing Shui didn’t know what to say, and thus he could only try to find some other topics to break the silence, and try to break the awkward atmosphere.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui tried his best to soften his tone, lacing it with warmth and gentleness. However, Shi Qingzhuang’s brows were creased, as she remained silent, and continued gazing at Qing Shui, causing Qing Shui to fear that she was somehow out of it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Shi Qingzhuang shifted her gaze to the tidy pile of clothes before looking at Qing Shui. After ascertaining that the clothes belonged to her, traces of panic began to show in her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This slightest bit of panic calmed Qing Shui down. At least, she was still capable of feeling something, and anything is still better than that state she was in before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I want to wear my clothes… Please go out first.” Shi Qingzhuang recovered as she calmly stated. Her voice was akin to that of celestial music, causing Qing Shui to feel extremely comfortable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you need me to help you put on your clothes? Your body is still unwell.” Qing Shui worriedly added, he was worried that she had yet to recover from their wild love-making from earlier.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I’ll do it myself. Just leave first!” Shi Qingzhuang sat up, as she used the blanket to cover her lower body, before sighing, with her head lowered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her appearance now looked very fragile, causing those who looked at her to feel sadness and pity. Qing Shui cast a long glance at Shi Qingzhuang, before slowly exiting the room, thinking of how to interact with her in the future. What if she didn’t want to be his woman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sounds of her donning her clothes alongside the sounds of intermittent sobs filled with sadness echoed out in the room. Qing Shui couldn’t take it anymore and decided to rush in, only to see that Shi Qingzhuang was wearing her panties halfway. She let out a gasp of surprise upon seeing Qing Shui rushing in. </span></p>
  <p><span style>It was unknown if that gasp of surprise was filled with embarrassment, shyness or anger!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Get out! You are not allowed to peek!” Shi Qingzhuang manically exclaimed, as finally, the tears of helplessness rolled down her face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt a burst of sourness and pain in his heart. That jade skin, those twin peaks. Qing Shui didn’t even register the body of Shi Qingzhuang as he went forth to embrace her in a hug.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t touch me! Go away! I don’t want to see you ever again.” Shi Qingzhuang finally broke down, as she sobbed in his embrace.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry, I was too forceful.” This was the first time Qing Shui came across such a situation, so he couldn’t help but panic as well. Qing Shui continued embracing Shi Qingzhuang, while helping her with her clothes. After several moments, Shi Qingzhuang regained her calm, and she glanced at that exquisite face of Qing Shui every now and then, not knowing what to say.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Initially, in his embrace, Shi Qingzhuang had struggled against him. However, after he expended tremendous effort in putting on her clothes for her, she had finally calmed down.</span></p>
  <p><span style>On Qing Shui’s forehead was a sheen of perspiration. It was as if he just fought in a great battle for three days, and a short while later Shi Qingzhuang was finally fully clothed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Umm, I will get some soup for you.” Qing Shui gently said, as he extended his hand to wipe the tears gently from her face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui removed the lid of the pot, and immediately, a fragrance permeated the room. Even a girl with zero desires in her heart like Shi Qingzhuang, couldn’t help but to be moved by the delicious smell of food.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui dished out the hot piping bowl of turtle soup. He sat on to the bed, and scooped the soup with a spoon, and cooled the soup by blowing on it before gently spoonfeeding Shi Qingzhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Maybe Shi Qingzhuang was hungry, or may be she was unable to resist the fragrance of the turtle soup, but she involuntarily opened her mouth and drank it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt satisfaction in his heart as he observed Shi Qingzhuang drinking the soup which he fed to her. Everytime she opened her mouth, Qing Shui couldn’t help but be reminded of the kisses they shared during their throes of passion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even after she finished eating the turtle soup, Shi Qingzhuang’s appetite was still not sated. She shyly glanced at Qing Shui before glancing at that pot of turtle soup again. Upon seeing that, Qing Shui knew that Shi Qingzhuang still wanted to eat, but was too embarrassed to bring up that request.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In his previous world, there was a saying – The best way to a man’s heart, was through his stomach. [1] Seems like this was true for this world too. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I still want more.” Shi Qingzhuang finally spoke, as she blushed. That expression of hers was so delicate that it caused Qing Shui to be unable to look away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just like that, Shi Qingzhuang, drank three more bowls of turtle soul. “This is so delicious, was it made by you?” A bright light flickered in Shi Qingzhuang’s eyes. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yeah, hmmm, are you still in pain?” Qing Shui opened and closed his mouth a few times before awkwarding gesturing to the area of her womanhood.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qingzhuang lowered her head as she bit her lips.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Okay, okay, I won’t say any more. I was just worried that you would be in pain…… I have something for you to consume, it should be able to aid you in recovery.” Qing Shui awkwardly laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What thing is that?” Maybe it was still very painful for her, as Shi Qingzhuang inclined her head, as she shyly asked Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The thing Qing Shui had mentioned, was none other than the agility-enhancing fruit. He had long retrieved two of those in preparation for giving them to Shi Qingzhuang. After all, after what he did to her, no matter what happened in the future, he still had to take care of her, and share his happiness and benefits together.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Clear Wind Fruit!” Shi Qingzhuang exclaimed in wonder.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was filled with a sense of bewilderment again. </span><i><span style>This fruit also existed in this world of the nine continents? It was the same situation for the energy-enhancing fruit!</span></i></p>
  <p><span style>“Clear Wind Fruit? Is this very famous?” Qing Shui asked, puzzlement evident in his tone. The clueless Qing Shui had no choice but to use the “Ancient Old Man” as an excuse again should Shi Qingzhuang question him on the origins of the fruits.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Clear Wind Fruit only grows on perilous cliffs where the windforce is extremely strong, and torrential winds are constantly raging. It is extremely rare for it to be harvested. This only matures after 100 years, and is exceedingly precious. Normally, only flying beasts would have a chance to discover this, and for every fruit consumed, the user would be able to increase their speed by 50%, however, the stacking effect stops after consumption of two fruits. How did you obtain two of such a precious fruit?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“An ancient old man once gifted these to me. He only said that it was something beneficial, asking me to consume two and give the rest to someone who’s very important to me.” Qing Shui replied without even blinking.</span></p>
