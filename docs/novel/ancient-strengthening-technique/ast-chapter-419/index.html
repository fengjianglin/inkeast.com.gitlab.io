 <p><strong>Chapter 419 Wild One-Horned Ox, The evolution of Mutated Beasts.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 419 - Wild One-Horned Ox, The evolution of Mutated Beasts</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qingqing watched the Diamond Demonic Boar with curiosity. She did not go forth to touch it, as there were too many people. Qing Shui spotted her trying to reach out her hand several times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The onlookers surrounded the beast for almost an hour. In that hour, he was asked various questions and was given heaps of praises. They praised him so much that Qing Shui felt slightly embarrassed. Many ladies were also ogling Qing Shui. It was as if any of the ladies there would scream for joy if Qing Shui asked them out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, are you a beast tamer?” A young man suddenly shouted.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The shout from that young man made everyone remember that popular career in Central Continent – Beast Tamers. The fact that Qing Shui could tame such a powerful demonic beast in such a short time made everyone look at him in awe.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I am not. In fact, I do not know what is going on. It just followed me after I beat it up." Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they heard Qing Shui’s reply, they felt that not only was Qing Shui powerful, but he was exceptionally lucky. When fighting with demonic beasts, the warriors of the Central Continent had to fight with their bare fists. After injuring the demonic beast, there was a small percentage that it would submit to the person. This applied to wild beasts as well. There were three people in Qing Village that have a level three Ferocious Beast each. They had tamed these beasts unintentionally after battling with them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under everyone’s reluctant looks, Qing Shui went back home with his jubilant family members. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had already become the backbone of the Qing family. As long as he was around, they could feel a presence of a “Deity" . This feeling may be a sense of superiority, solidarity, or a sense of honor.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On their way home, there were chatter and laughter. Everything was very harmonious. The Diamond Demonic Boar walked beside Qing Shui while Qingqing and Qing Bei discussed about the Diamond Demonic Boar at the back of the group.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The news had spread throughout the vicinity of Qing Village, so they paused a few times on the way back as the crowd sprinkled Qing Shui with looks of envy. The envious glances of these strangers at the generous Qing Shui was not the last of it some of them even looked at the Diamond Demonic Boar with covetous eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After returning home, Qing Shui was contemplating whether he should try to bring the Diamond Demonic Boar into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal all the time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clearly knew that any living thing from the outside world could not be brought into the &nbsp;realm if it did not have any connection with Qing Shui. He had never actually tested it. He did not know if he was simply incapable of bringing something inside or if whatever he brought inside would perish in the process. Qing Shui could only make unconvincing conjectures at this point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His Firebird could enter, so why could fishes, crabs, shrimp, and etc. enter as well? Qing Shui felt quite perplexed at the moment, and he felt that it was necessary for him to test this out.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not surprised to know that Firebird could enter the Realm. It was nurtured in the Realm and had a very close relationship with Qing Shui. But what about the various snakehead fishes and tortoises that he brought in from the outside world. Does that mean it was only limited to aquatic creatures likes fishes, crustaceans, etc?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui brought the Diamond Demonic Boar out of the Qing residence again. He ran towards the nearest alder forest because Qing Shui thought that it would be more prudent to test it out. Qing Shui did not want to use the Diamond Demonic Boar for his experiment, as it would be a great loss if anything happened to it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Walking around in the alder forest, there had never been any sightings of demonic beasts in the area outside of Qing village in Hundred Miles City. However, there were the usual wild beasts and ferocious beasts, and then there were tracks from Desolate Beasts.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">High level Desolate Beasts were only seen once every few years.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui ran casually into the depth of the alder forest with his Diamond Demonic Boar, he was very fast. Even though the sky had already darkened, it did not affect Qing Shui’s abilities. Not to mention that the moon was emitting a bright moonlight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a wild One-Horned Ox appeared in Qing Shui's field of vision.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was three meters in length, and it was the height of a human. Its whole body was tar black. Its body was covered in sinewy muscles that made it look boorishly impulsive, and especially violent. It had a sharp, long horn on its head, which was almost two feet long. The base of the horn was almost the size of an adult’s arm. Its slightly spiral sharp horn reflected a black sheen under the moonlight.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As soon as its pair of bell-like eyes spotted Qing Shui, it suddenly spirited towards Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Level 8 Ferocious Beast, One-Horned Ox !" Qing Shui smiled and looked at the stupid ox as it charged at him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Wild One-Horned Ox was the most violent and most stupid almost all beast types. It was one of the strongest types around this alder forest. It would charge at any moving creature it spots to attack it with its horn.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most beasts were very sensitive to danger. However, the wild One-Horned Ox which was foolishly heading Qing Shui’s way was an exception. Besides, Qing Shui had already surpassed the Obscure Realm, so his Qi aura was totally concealed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Fine. I will use you for the experiment.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the beast’s sharp horn was just a foot away, Qing Shui simply reached out to grab it firmly. The force generated from this one ton ox charging at this speed was about ten thousand jin. A normal person would have be smashed to bits, but it was negligible to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Wild One-Horned Ox's red eyes stared at Qing Shui and let out a violent moo. Qing Shui used his other hand and struck the back of the robust Wild One-Horned Ox.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Crack!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sound of broken bones was accompanied by an even more ferocious cry!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this time, Qing Shui wrapped the wild ox with his spirit energy and brought it towards the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A force appeared that directly pushed the ox out, and he was unable to pull the ox into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal even after three tries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Huff!" Qing Shui punched the wild One-Horned ox’s neck.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It died without make a single sound!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui tried to “keep” it in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time round, he could bring the wild One-Horned Ox’s carcass into the realm very smoothly. This was not surprising, Qing Shui concluded that the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal rejected anything with vitality.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But why could live fishes be brought in?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lowered his head in deep thought. While he looked down on the ground in the alder forest, &nbsp;he saw a type of grasshopper-like insect. With his quick thinking, Qing Shui used his spirit energy to capture them and successfully managed to bring them into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal .</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Does it mean that it will reject any creatures whose vital energy has reached a certain level?” Qing Shui was quite certain that this was the answer.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a feeling that the Diamond Demonic Boar should be able to enter the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. The Diamond Demonic Boar now had a close connection with Qing Shui. Living things with close bonds to him would most likely not be rejected by the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I’ll just try. If it can enter, it will be more convenient. Otherwise, I will just let it stay obediently in Qing village. Previously, as with the Wild One-Horned Ox, nothing will happen to the creature—it will just be pushed out. "</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wrapped the Diamond Demonic Board with his spirit energy, and closed his eyes. He pushed it and just like he was moving an object, he managed to “move” the boar in. He did not have the same feeling as before, as if he was trying to press a mountain into a bottle but could not.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that it was a success. When he opened his eyes, the Diamond Demonic Boar had disappeared before his eyes, and his senses told him that something had been added to the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately appeared in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, but what he saw inside made him want to burst out laughing. The Diamond Demonic Boar was prostrating on the ground and trembling, while his Firebird was hovering in the sky, staring at the Diamond Demonic Boar and constantly screeching.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui communicated with the Firebird telepathically to tell his Firebird not to bully that little thing. He also told Diamond Demonic Boar not to touch the things inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui told the Diamond Demonic Boar that it could only touch the several fishes and prawns in the pond, and nothing else. He took two Agility-enhancing fruit, two Endurance-enhancing fruit and two strength-enhancing fruit. There were no more energy fruits.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw the shimmering golden light from the Diamond Demonic Boar’s body, he thought of the Beast Pill. However, there were no more Beast pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He also remembered the Endurance Pellet recipe that Canghai Mingyue had given to him at the Canghai residence in the Southern Continent. He had also used up all the Endurance Pellets he had with him, and he almost forgotten about it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">How could he actually forget this? Qing Shui immediately decided to make some Endurance Pellets. The pellets were easy to make, so Qing Shui made quite a few so that his family members could each have one. Endurance pellets increased a human’s endurance by 5% and a beast’s endurance by 10%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beast pills were very potent and required a long time to prepare. It was too time-consuming for Qing Shui to simple make one batch of it solely for the Diamond Demonic Beast, so he decided against it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He remembered the recipe for the Endurance Pellet. It only required five ingredients. Its main ingredient was the Endurance Enhancing Fruit (also known as Diamond fruit in the main continent). Qing Shui had this. He also had quite a lot of 1000-year Lingzhi, which he had taken from the Yan Treasury. He had a lot of 1000-year demonic beast cores. He could replace the tooth of the Demonic Snowy Wolf Beast with the blood of the Golden Medicinal Turtle. He also had quite a lot of Demonic Bear Beast Gallbladders.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He channelled a huge cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Qing Shui’s capabilities had already greatly improved after he broke through the 140th cycle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already very familiar with his pill-refining skills, it could be said that his technique and control of heat were already at a perfect stage. Using his Primordial Flames, the ancient flames within the Heaven and Earth, his Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, one of the world’s finest, and Qing Shui’s exceptional alchemy skills, it was extremely easy for Qing Shui to make the pellets.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Washing. Mixing. Tempering. &nbsp;Melting. Fusing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did this in an orderly manner. He placed the ingredients into his Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and heated it with his Primordial Flames. He then opened his Spiritual Sense to observe everything minutely and placed the initial order of the herbs into the gold Sui iron furnace, brought up the chaos fire, sent out his Spiritual Sense, refining the demon furnace in the slight sublimation and fusions of the cauldron.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was done.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui opened the cauldron and saw that there were twelves pellets. Compared to the previous time in the Southern Continent, Qing Shui could make an additional two pellet for each batch. This meant that his alchemy skill was improving.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had taken him almost 6 hours. Qing Shui took two pellets and called upon the Diamond Demonic Boar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Smelling the faint pleasant scent of the Endurance Pellet, the Diamond Demonic Boar opened its mouth and looked at Qing Shui expectantly. Qing Shui threw a pellet in. Within moments, the Diamond Demonic Beast emitted a bright light. The brilliance could be compared to the light that the Firebird emitted previously.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was very surprising to Qing Shui. There was a possibility that Firebirds descended from Phoenixes, so their bodies contained some phoenix blood. &nbsp;But the Diamond Demonic Boar was just a pig ... ...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in for a bigger surprise. The Diamond Demonic Boar shone again. Its brilliance did not fade but was even brighter. After the bright golden rays faded, Qing Shui looked at the Diamond Demonic Boar in shock.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, the Diamond Demonic Boar had been restored to its previous size. It was actually a bit bigger and its nose was slightly longer. It still looked cute, but its body seemed much stronger.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It wasn’t hard to imagine what would become of the Diamond Demonic Boar in the future.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not surprised to know that Firebird could enter the Realm. It was nurtured in the Realm and had a very close relationship with Qing Shui. But what about the various snakehead fishes and tortoises that he brought in from the outside world. Does that mean it was only limited to aquatic creatures likes fishes, crustaceans, etc?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui brought the Diamond Demonic Boar out of the Qing residence again. He ran towards the nearest alder forest because Qing Shui thought that it would be more prudent to test it out. Qing Shui did not want to use the Diamond Demonic Boar for his experiment, as it would be a great loss if anything happened to it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Walking around in the alder forest, there had never been any sightings of demonic beasts in the area outside of Qing village in Hundred Miles City. However, there were the usual wild beasts and ferocious beasts, and then there were tracks from Desolate Beasts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">High level Desolate Beasts were only seen once every few years.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui ran casually into the depth of the alder forest with his Diamond Demonic Boar, he was very fast. Even though the sky had already darkened, it did not affect Qing Shui’s abilities. Not to mention that the moon was emitting a bright moonlight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a wild One-Horned Ox appeared in Qing Shui's field of vision.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was three meters in length, and it was the height of a human. Its whole body was tar black. Its body was covered in sinewy muscles that made it look boorishly impulsive, and especially violent. It had a sharp, long horn on its head, which was almost two feet long. The base of the horn was almost the size of an adult’s arm. Its slightly spiral sharp horn reflected a black sheen under the moonlight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As soon as its pair of bell-like eyes spotted Qing Shui, it suddenly spirited towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Level 8 Ferocious Beast, One-Horned Ox !" Qing Shui smiled and looked at the stupid ox as it charged at him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Wild One-Horned Ox was the most violent and most stupid almost all beast types. It was one of the strongest types around this alder forest. It would charge at any moving creature it spots to attack it with its horn.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most beasts were very sensitive to danger. However, the wild One-Horned Ox which was foolishly heading Qing Shui’s way was an exception. Besides, Qing Shui had already surpassed the Obscure Realm, so his Qi aura was totally concealed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Fine. I will use you for the experiment.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the beast’s sharp horn was just a foot away, Qing Shui simply reached out to grab it firmly. The force generated from this one ton ox charging at this speed was about ten thousand jin. A normal person would have be smashed to bits, but it was negligible to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Wild One-Horned Ox's red eyes stared at Qing Shui and let out a violent moo. Qing Shui used his other hand and struck the back of the robust Wild One-Horned Ox.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Crack!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sound of broken bones was accompanied by an even more ferocious cry!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this time, Qing Shui wrapped the wild ox with his spirit energy and brought it towards the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A force appeared that directly pushed the ox out, and he was unable to pull the ox into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal even after three tries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Huff!" Qing Shui punched the wild One-Horned ox’s neck.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It died without make a single sound!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui tried to “keep” it in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time round, he could bring the wild One-Horned Ox’s carcass into the realm very smoothly. This was not surprising, Qing Shui concluded that the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal rejected anything with vitality.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But why could live fishes be brought in?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lowered his head in deep thought. While he looked down on the ground in the alder forest, &nbsp;he saw a type of grasshopper-like insect. With his quick thinking, Qing Shui used his spirit energy to capture them and successfully managed to bring them into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal .</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Does it mean that it will reject any creatures whose vital energy has reached a certain level?” Qing Shui was quite certain that this was the answer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a feeling that the Diamond Demonic Boar should be able to enter the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. The Diamond Demonic Boar now had a close connection with Qing Shui. Living things with close bonds to him would most likely not be rejected by the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I’ll just try. If it can enter, it will be more convenient. Otherwise, I will just let it stay obediently in Qing village. Previously, as with the Wild One-Horned Ox, nothing will happen to the creature—it will just be pushed out. "</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wrapped the Diamond Demonic Board with his spirit energy, and closed his eyes. He pushed it and just like he was moving an object, he managed to “move” the boar in. He did not have the same feeling as before, as if he was trying to press a mountain into a bottle but could not.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that it was a success. When he opened his eyes, the Diamond Demonic Boar had disappeared before his eyes, and his senses told him that something had been added to the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately appeared in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, but what he saw inside made him want to burst out laughing. The Diamond Demonic Boar was prostrating on the ground and trembling, while his Firebird was hovering in the sky, staring at the Diamond Demonic Boar and constantly screeching.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui communicated with the Firebird telepathically to tell his Firebird not to bully that little thing. He also told Diamond Demonic Boar not to touch the things inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui told the Diamond Demonic Boar that it could only touch the several fishes and prawns in the pond, and nothing else. He took two Agility-enhancing fruit, two Endurance-enhancing fruit and two strength-enhancing fruit. There were no more energy fruits.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw the shimmering golden light from the Diamond Demonic Boar’s body, he thought of the Beast Pill. However, there were no more Beast pills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He also remembered the Endurance Pellet recipe that Canghai Mingyue had given to him at the Canghai residence in the Southern Continent. He had also used up all the Endurance Pellets he had with him, and he almost forgotten about it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">How could he actually forget this? Qing Shui immediately decided to make some Endurance Pellets. The pellets were easy to make, so Qing Shui made quite a few so that his family members could each have one. Endurance pellets increased a human’s endurance by 5% and a beast’s endurance by 10%.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beast pills were very potent and required a long time to prepare. It was too time-consuming for Qing Shui to simple make one batch of it solely for the Diamond Demonic Beast, so he decided against it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He remembered the recipe for the Endurance Pellet. It only required five ingredients. Its main ingredient was the Endurance Enhancing Fruit (also known as Diamond fruit in the main continent). Qing Shui had this. He also had quite a lot of 1000-year Lingzhi, which he had taken from the Yan Treasury. He had a lot of 1000-year demonic beast cores. He could replace the tooth of the Demonic Snowy Wolf Beast with the blood of the Golden Medicinal Turtle. He also had quite a lot of Demonic Bear Beast Gallbladders.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He channelled a huge cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Qing Shui’s capabilities had already greatly improved after he broke through the 140th cycle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already very familiar with his pill-refining skills, it could be said that his technique and control of heat were already at a perfect stage. Using his Primordial Flames, the ancient flames within the Heaven and Earth, his Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, one of the world’s finest, and Qing Shui’s exceptional alchemy skills, it was extremely easy for Qing Shui to make the pellets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Washing. Mixing. Tempering. &nbsp;Melting. Fusing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did this in an orderly manner. He placed the ingredients into his Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and heated it with his Primordial Flames. He then opened his Spiritual Sense to observe everything minutely and placed the initial order of the herbs into the gold Sui iron furnace, brought up the chaos fire, sent out his Spiritual Sense, refining the demon furnace in the slight sublimation and fusions of the cauldron.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was done.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui opened the cauldron and saw that there were twelves pellets. Compared to the previous time in the Southern Continent, Qing Shui could make an additional two pellet for each batch. This meant that his alchemy skill was improving.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had taken him almost 6 hours. Qing Shui took two pellets and called upon the Diamond Demonic Boar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Smelling the faint pleasant scent of the Endurance Pellet, the Diamond Demonic Boar opened its mouth and looked at Qing Shui expectantly. Qing Shui threw a pellet in. Within moments, the Diamond Demonic Beast emitted a bright light. The brilliance could be compared to the light that the Firebird emitted previously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was very surprising to Qing Shui. There was a possibility that Firebirds descended from Phoenixes, so their bodies contained some phoenix blood. &nbsp;But the Diamond Demonic Boar was just a pig ... ...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in for a bigger surprise. The Diamond Demonic Boar shone again. Its brilliance did not fade but was even brighter. After the bright golden rays faded, Qing Shui looked at the Diamond Demonic Boar in shock.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, the Diamond Demonic Boar had been restored to its previous size. It was actually a bit bigger and its nose was slightly longer. It still looked cute, but its body seemed much stronger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It wasn’t hard to imagine what would become of the Diamond Demonic Boar in the future.&nbsp;</p>
