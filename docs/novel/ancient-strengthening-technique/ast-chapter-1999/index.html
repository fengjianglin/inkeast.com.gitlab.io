Her eyes were filled with guilt and sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went towards them. He rubbed both Little Mo’s and Qing Ci’s head, while calmly said, “I am here now, what are you crying like that for? In the future, do not ever attempt to come alone again. You must tell me about every single thing that happens. Leave everything to your master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, I am sorry. I wrote the things which you taught me for them. Yes, and it’s still here.” Qing Ci said with a guilty voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Foolish brat, you are my disciple. I don’t care who you want to teach the things which I taught you to. I only want you guys to be safe. If the situation doesn’t allow it, as long as both you and Little Mo are safe, I won’t mind if you sacrifice that kind of external possessions. We aren’t short of that. Continue to follow me and learn. In the future, even if you don’t have any cultivations, other people won’t have any choice but to protect you. A formidable physician only needs to move his mouth and thousands of men would have come to protect him. Thus, a lot of people will make sure nothing happens to you in the future. If anyone dares to injure you, it’s very likely that the person would have gotten himself into trouble before you do.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ci hugged Qing Shui and cried. No one had ever treated her that well and spoilt her so much before. At this moment, she felt that she was like a little girl. She could only find this kind of feeling from her father when she was young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hand and poked it on her body a few times, before piercing her with his Golden Needles. After that, Qing Ci’s strength immediately recovered back to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, noises of footsteps were heard coming from outside. Qing Shui knew that the people from the opposing force had come, but he wasn’t worried. As long as he was willing, no one would be able to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was already very confident in himself, to begin with. With the Buddha Light Treasure Qi aiding him, his combat ability had yet again increased significantly. By now, Qing Shui was already like a cockroach which couldn’t be beaten to death. As for his offensive prowess, by adding a few unique techniques, he could immediately slaughter his opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui still had the Dragon Slaying Beast. Killing people was like cutting off grass to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who dares to intrude to the Sacred Medicine Palace?” A man’s voice could already be heard before he even showed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked to the corner of the yard. The courtyard here was very big. By now, about a hundred men already came. Furthermore, they were all experts. After all, an enemy had already broken into the old man’s nest in the Sacred Medicine Palace. It would be weird if they could still remain silent about it. All of the experts in the palace were summoned here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was looking at the leading man who looked like an elderly man. He was muscular and had a very thick beard, making himself look like an old lion. However, the body function of the ‘old lion’ was still at its peak state. Just as the saying went, he was truly old but vigorous. The old man had very faint wrinkles on his face. His hair also looked white. He seemed quite formidable dressing in a white gown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had an unusually tall figure. Both of his eyes were big and looked very lively. At this moment, he was staring at Qing Shui and the old man behind him, who had been beaten to the point he became like a mollusk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, please find justice for me!” The old man said with a weak voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui first looked at the old man. And then, he moved his sight to the few elderly men who were close to him. They should all be the old man’s disciple. From well-aged men all the way up to the middle-aged one, there were quite a lot of them. They were all looking at Qing Shui furiously at this moment, as if the fire was going to shoot out from their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am only here to return the favor. I would never have thought that someone would actually dare to kidnap my people from the Imperial Cuisine Hall and he even thought about cutting off their arms and legs.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense! I didn’t kidnap anyone. It’s you who brought other people here with the intention to steal our medical prescriptions.” Even though the old man was weak, he was still able to say it loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stomped the ground and immediately, a stone with the size of a fist sprung out of it. Qing Shui kicked the stone away. Immediately, the stone went straight into the old man’s mouth. It knocked off his teeth and stuffed his mouth right away. Because all of his limbs were crushed, he was neither able to take it out nor spit it. As for swallowing it, that was even more impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu-wu…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You ignorant brat!” The old man was so angry, to the point his hair started standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, first of all. I don’t bring troubles to people unless they crossed the line first. And if there is a person who dares to snatch my people away, I will definitely make him suffer to the point he would rather die. Not even a single person involved should dream about running away from here.” Qing Shui was actually very furious. He was staring at the old man with both of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good… Good... No one had ever acted so ignorantly in the Sacred Medicine Palace before.” The old man was obviously very angry with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa, let me teach him a lesson!” A middle-aged, well-trained man came out and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is able to wound Qiu Di. You won’t stand a chance against him.” The old man said softly. By now, he had already calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Martial uncle must have ended up like that from being sneak attacked by him. There is no way such a young man could beat martial uncle.” The middle-aged man said with a firm voice like he knew it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu-wu…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mouth was stuffed with a stone. The only thing that could be seen was fresh blood flowing out of his mouth. The old man called Qiu Di could do nothing but to whimper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man saw his disciple in a pathetic state. Moreover, he was one of the more outstanding disciples. The eyes of the old man, when he was looking at Qing Shui, were filled with rage, “Hong Chen, go and take a look at your junior martial brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man felt very upset when he was saying that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old man moved forward. This old man was the senior martial brother of Qiu Di. In other words, he was the old man who was talking to Qiu Di the other day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took out the stone. By now, Qiu Di was already unable to talk. There were no more teeth left in his mouth. His mouth was filled with fresh blood. He looked extremely miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you're telling me that my disciple kidnapped your people and is thirsting for your medical knowledge?” The old man looked at Qing Shui and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a joke. Sacred Medicine Palace has passed on its inheritance for so long. As if we would care about someone like you. Young man, even if you wanted to lie, you should have thought about a more reliable excuse.” The old man said with an angry tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does this mean that you don’t believe me?” Qing Shui remained calm and composed. Naturally, the enemies wouldn’t admit to things like that. This was a matter which could ruin the Sacred Medicine Palace’s reputation. Once it was spread out, it would become a standing joke to the people across the World of the Nine Continents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t feel weird about it, “Well, if that’s the case, I don’t think there is anything more to say. He was already punished for snatching away my men and thirsting for my medical skills. I am a person who remembers my grudges and gratitudes clearly. Let’s leave the things which happened today as it is. I still need to get back and attend to the patient’s illnesses.” Qing Shui left as soon as he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stand right where you are! Do you think that this place is a place where you can come, leave and cause havoc as you please?” The old man’s voice sounded cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, old man, can you please tell me what you want? It is generous of me to not looking for troubles with you guys. In a way, this is also a great thing. Alright then, let’s count our debts together. I hope you guys won’t regret this.” Qing Shui turned around and said in an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must give the Sacred Medicine Palace an explanation for the things which happened today.” The old man had his eyes wide open and said with a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An explanation huh? Hahaha, alright. I will give you one.” Qing Shui laughed out loud and at the moment he finished speaking, he stomped on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blastwave which resembled that of a ripple was released towards Qiu Di.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You little brat! You dare!?” The old man screamed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fear could be seen in Qiu Di’s eyes that were struggling to live. After that, he immediately disappeared. Blood could be seen splattering through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things were beyond the point of turning back. Initially, Qing Shui only planned to punish Qiu Di to ease his anger. This was because Qiu Di wouldn’t be able to live for more than three days. Thus, he didn’t really feel like dwelling on the matter. But now, it seemed things wouldn’t be as simple as he thought. Since that was the case, he might as well make it big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you satisfied with the way I explain myself?” Qing Shui looked at the old man as he advanced step by step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was infuriated by Qing Shui. “Ignorant, he was being too ignorant!” thought the old man furiously. The old man’s hand was shaking as he pointed towards Qing Shui, “You ignorant brat! You are digging your own grave! Kill him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You old geezer. Please don’t think like I don’t know anything. As if your disciple can hide whatever he does from you. Yes, there is no wrong in covering up one’s mistake, but there has to be a limit to it. Remember this, once I start to make my move. I will definitely eliminate the Sacred Medicine Palace.” Qing Shui could see the old man’s rage filling his entire eyes. The old man immediately trembled when he heard Qing Shui’s words.</span></p>
