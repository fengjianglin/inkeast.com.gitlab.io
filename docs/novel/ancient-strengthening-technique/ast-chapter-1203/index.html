 <p><strong>AST 1203 - Snowjade Poison Jiao, Killing with the Nine Yang Gold Needles In One Move</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui took action directly. Even in the past, Qing Shui would dare to hit the people from Mu Clan. Right now, the Seal of Roc was at the small success stage and thus the pressure on him had lessened even more now. Moreover, this person's mouth was extremely foul.</p>
 <p>Mu Clan was situated on the boundaries of the Great Yu Dynasty and was very far away. Although Mu Clan's reputation was great, their influence here wasn't as strong as Yan Clan's.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very sudden when he struck and he struck at that person's face. This was equal to smacking Mu Clan in the face. Therefore, everyone around them was instantly stunned. Many of them didn't know who Qing Shui was and felt that this time around, he was in deep trouble. After all, these people were members of Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>"Full of shit. Haven't your seniors at home taught you how to speak? Did they teach you to be so arrogant, biting everyone you see?" Qing Shui sent one of them flying and said unhappily.</p>
 <p>That person's mouth was too foul. They were at Yan Clan and there was going to be at a happy event. Therefore, he didn’t want to make too big of a deal out of this and only broke off his teeth.</p>
 <p>"It's none of your concern whether our seniors have taught me how to speak. I only saw that you raised your hand against a member of our Mu Clan. How can our people be hit by anyone?" The young-looking man in the middle frowned and stared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>This man, Mu Chaoye, held a respectable position in Mu Clan. When had he ever been treated with such contempt? The other time, this person had stopped him from getting close to Seventh Princess and right now, he had even struck the face of one of his clan members.</p>
 <p>"Oh? So you're going to rely on Mu Clan to bully others? You're prepared to bite?" Qing Shui remained calm as he looked at this man.</p>
 <p>"What kind of skill is lip service? If you're that capable, then let's have a spar." Mu Chaoye looked at Qing Shui with a cold gleam shining in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was taken aback by his words as well. Only then did he carefully sense this guy's abilities. This person was very strong, as expected of a member of an aristocratic clan. Their clan's legacy should be very powerful. However, his abilities should be about the same as Yan Yangchen. What did he have to challenge Qing Shui with? Was he unaware that Qing Shui had defeated Tian Jiange?</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui very quickly dismissed this thought. It was impossible that this person wasn't aware. Neither was this the first day the person had been in Yan City. He should at least have heard of Qing Shui. Could it be that he did not believe in what he had heard?</p>
 <p>"How are we going to compete? I'm willing to take you on!" Qing Shui wasn't afraid and thus said to Mu Chaoye.</p>
 <p>"We'll have a fight, with no responsibility held for life or death. If one party were to ask to be spared, he must promise the victor one condition. Otherwise, the victor will have the rights to decide on the loser's life or death." Mu Chaoye looked at Qing Shui and said each word clearly.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you guys are here!"</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yan Jinyu, Yan Yangchen, Seventh Princess, and the others came over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to greet them.</p>
 <p>"Lad, why, do you dare to accept this challenge?" Mu Chaoye looked at Qing Shui and said again.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, don't accept it. His weapon is a Snowjade Poison Jiao. That Snowjade Poison Jiao of his is a mutated beast and has killed many Grade Three State Masters." Hearing Mu Chaoye's words, Seventh Princess quickly informed Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned to hear that the guy's weapon was a Snowjade Poison Jiao. In the past, he had only heard of people using living things as weapons, but he hadn't expected to encounter such a person today. Using demonic beasts as a weapon was different from Beast Tamers.</p>
 <p>Those who use demonic beasts as weapons tended to use snake-type demonic beasts. The smallest kind could be hidden in one's sleeves while bigger ones could cover even the skies. Demonic beasts which were used as weapons tended to feed on the blood essence of humans and had a mental connection established with their owners. With the demonic beast's ability and the brain of a human, the prowess of the demonic beast would be brought to its peaks.</p>
 <p>Demonic beasts' prowess and grade were much more powerful humans. They were much stronger in terms of their physical strength, endurance, and resistance. Their only problem was that they weren't as intelligent as humans. This was considered a balance. Otherwise, it would really be hard for humans to remain competitive.</p>
 <p>However, there were times when such situations would be changed. For example, when using demonic beasts as weapons.</p>
 <p>"Why? You don't dare and are going to shrink back like a tortoise?" Mu Chaoye spoke with great contempt.</p>
 <p>"Mu Chaoye, we don't welcome you here. You can leave." Seventh Princess looked at Mu Chaoye and said with displeasure.</p>
 <p>"So you're a good-for-nothing who only knows how to hide behind women. To think that I had previously thought that you're a powerful expert. I had overestimated you." Mu Chaoye didn't pay Seventh Princess any heed and continued to speak to Qing Shui in great disdain.</p>
 <p>"You deserve to die!"</p>
 <p>The girl's pernicious aura exploded out toward Mu Chaoye. A thick layer of pernicious aura encompassed Mu Chaoye.</p>
 <p>The girl was about to move when she was held back by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Alright, he's just a clown. I'll just take it that I had been bitten by a mad dog. You really think that you're unrivaled just because you have a Snowjade Poison Jiao? I'll take up your challenge. If you can take three attacks from me, then I'll take it as my loss." Qing Shui held back the girl and said to Mu Chaoye, whose countenance had turned pale. The things that these people said, especially what they had said about the little girl, had initially made Qing Shui wanted to kill them. These people were actually no different from ruffians and the only thing different about them was that they came from a well-to-do family.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui..."</p>
 <p>"I know what I'm doing!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Mu Chaoye went up into the air. This was how it was like in the world of cultivators. Ordinary people and commoners wouldn't be able to understand. The moment both parties couldn't agree on something, they would draw their weapons and send blood splattering!</p>
 <p>"Lad, you didn't even think of the consequences before you boasted. I shall see how you're going to win against me within three moves." Mu Chaoye looked toward Qing Shui from afar and said.</p>
 <p>"Bring out your weapon. Don't die because you weren't able to bring it out and end up not even being able to regret it." Qing Shui drew out his Big Dipper Sword and said to Mu Chaoye.</p>
 <p>This time around, Mu Chaoye didn't say anything and just stretched out his hand. A small Jiao that was snow white like jade circled around his body. It exuded an aura that was sharp as a needle. The eerie part about this Snowjade Poison Jiao was its snow white body which only had a pair of pitch-black horns. The two horns were a purplish-black color. The Snowjade Poison Jiao was only about 30 meters in length and was the thickness of a person's upper thigh.</p>
 <p>"Die!"</p>
 <p>Mu Chaoye let out a soft bellow and waved his hand. The Snowjade Poison Jiao was like a snow white arrow, bringing with it a hint of black as it shot out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had made a claim earlier and thus he didn't dare to be careless. He had already had it thought out. If all went to naught, he would just completely fall out with Mu Clan. Right now, he felt that they won't be able to do anything to him.</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>White steam gradually extended out around Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>The gold needle in his hand flashed.</p>
 <p>Nine Yang Gold Needle, Demon Binding Ropes!</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had a strong resistance to poison, he didn't wish to let his guard down and thus circulated his powers to their limit and also activated Area Dominance.</p>
 <p>That Snowjade Poison Jiao's pitch-black head slammed into the region of the Area Dominance. Its color faded off a little and the poison remained in its head. The Area Dominance was still quite powerful.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Qing Shui bound the Snowjade Poison Jiao with the Demon Binding Ropes and avoided the venom it had spewed out. His right hand then pierced the Nine Yang Gold Needle with great accuracy into its reverse scale.</p>
 <p>Violet Gold Divine Force!</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>In addition to the primordial flames, a domineering force erupted from Qing Shui's blood, and the Nine Yang force from his bones exploded inside the Snowjade Poison Jiao's body.</p>
 <p>Pa pa pa...</p>
 <p>A series of densely packed explosive sounds rang out, turning the Snowjade Poison Jiao's internal body into a messy lump. The Snowjade Poison Jiao had a body that was tough as diamond and it was almost impossible to hurt its body. This was also where Mu Chaoye’s confidence laid. However, snakes, pythons, Jiaos, and dragons would all have reverse scales where they were the weakest. However, they weren't so easily attacked. The Snowjade Poison Jiao's reverse scale was only the size of the tip of one's pinky. Bigger weapons wouldn't be able to attack it.</p>
 <p>The Snowjade Poison Jiao was unlucky to have encountered Qing Shui and it died from his gold needle attack!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Snowjade Poison Jiao which had lost its vitality. This was a coincidence as well. If not for the fact that he had the gold needles and powerful acupuncture skills, it would really be hard for him to kill it. If it was some other cultivator, even if they were to use the gold needles, they wouldn't be able to pierce its reverse scale, let alone hope to mess up the Snowjade Poison Jiao's meridian channels completely.</p>
 <p>Mu Chaoye looked at the Snowjade Poison Jiao he had lost and stood there in a daze. He couldn't accept the fact that Qing Shui had managed to kill it in one move. The reason he dared to fight against Qing Shui was because he could rely on the Snowjade Poison Jiao. Without it, he could only wait for an instant kill. Earlier, he was protected by the Snowjade Poison Jiao but right now, he was completely exposed...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly walked towards Mu Chaoye. Each step he took felt very heavy. When Mu Chaoye saw Qing Shui walking over, he shouted out as if he had seen a devil.</p>
 <p>"I'll promise you anything! Don't kill me!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this Young Master from Mu Clan. He was just dreg who came from a good background, inheriting the clan's legacy and receiving powerful medicinal pills, living a smooth life till today.</p>
 <p>"Do you want to cripple your own cultivation or shall I do it for you?" Qing Shui asked softly.</p>
 <p>"Ahh, don't! I'll give you anything you want! Don't cripple me of my cultivation!" Mu Chaoye shouted out, terrified.</p>
 <p>"My condition is to cripple your cultivation."</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui was using him as a warning to the others. He wanted others to know what the consequences would be for offending him.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Li! Save me!" Mu Chaoye shouted out loudly.</p>
 <p>"Sigh!"</p>
 <p>A sigh rang out and with two flashes a man appeared next to Mu Chaoye.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Li, kill him, kill him...."</p>
 <p>"Shut up! Haven't you been humiliated enough?!" Uncle Li bellowed loudly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this old man called Uncle Li. He couldn't tell how old the old man was but his hair was snow-white. However, there wasn't a hint of wrinkles on his face. His thin eyes exuded sharpness and might and his plain looking robes made him exude the aura of a great expert.</p>
 <p>The old man was strong!</p>
 <p>"Young man, I'm from Mu Clan. Can you do a favor out of respect to Mu Clan? As the saying goes, it's better to make friends than enemies. What do you think if we were to forget everything today?" The old man looked at Qing Shui as if he was smiling but yet not doing so.</p>
 <p>"Forget everything? Respect? What kind of respect do you deserve to have everything today canceled out?" Qing Shui looked at the old man and asked calmly.</p>
 <p>He didn't like how the old man was putting up a domineering front. How was he going to show his face if he were to shrink back just because of a word from an old man?</p>
 <p>"Haha, excellent, excellent. Youngsters really do have great vigor. There hasn't been anyone who has refused to show me any respect. I shall see how you're going to cripple his cultivation today." Uncle Li bellowed.</p>
 <p>"You're treating the royalty in contempt, as well as looking down at all cultivators in contempt." Qing Shui refused to back off.</p>
 <p>"How dare you! I shall see how capable you are to be so arrogant!" The old man was about to take action after saying this.</p>
 <p>"You can go ahead and try. I'll see if I can let your blood splatter. Cripple that good-for-nothing yourself. If I were to be the one to do it, I don't mind crippling you of your cultivation as well." A charming voice rang out. There was an indescribable temptation to her attractive voice.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could tell that it was Eldest Princess' voice.</p>
