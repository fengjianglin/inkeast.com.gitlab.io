 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan was very happy after recognized as the owners from the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda. She never expected that such a small tower could carry so much power. Qing Shui could tell that Qing You and the others were really envious of her. Prior to this, he had gone through its functions with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled when he saw their expression, ”Alright, there is no need to be like that. Indeed, this thing may be great, but whether or not one can harness its power is also up to the person using it. The amount of strength it increases is related to the user’s strength. In other words, the more powerful the bearer is, the greater its effect will be. If an ordinary person uses it, the effect drawn upon it will be negligible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We know… We are just really envious of Luan Luan. Brother Qing Shui, can’t we even do that?” Qing You chuckled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hands and patted Qing You’s head. As of now, all of the men from his generations were already married and had their own children. Qing Bei was the only person left, but if everything went as planned, it wouldn’t be long until she also got married. Once she did, it would mean that everyone from his generations had established their own family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure. You can be envious all you want. Let me make you guys some stuff later. For you all, these things may be a lot better than the towers.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Qing Shui! I also want some!” Qing You said quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

He first forged them before refining them through special means or with the Primordial Flame. These were all within Qing Shui’s capabilities. The Ancient Strengthening Technique was a variation of the Dao Techniques. In a way, Qing Shui could be considered as one of those who practiced the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Necklaces and jade pendants… Bracelets and jade ornaments. Whoever liked it would be free to take it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was right. To some of the low-leveled warriors from the Qing Clan, getting the things which he made would be even better than the small towers. Only after Qing Shui finished forging all the stuffs, did he realize that the results were out of his expectations. They might be even better than what he had thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t help but wonder if it had something to do with his strength, or merely because of the materials which he used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both factors should be somehow related to it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These things were available for anyone with the strength below the Martial Emperor Level. For warriors with the strength below the Martial Emperor but above the Martial Saint, their overall abilities would be doubled. They were also able to deflect against the attacks from the enemies. For warriors with the strength below the Martial Saints Level, their abilities would be doubled and they could deflect the damages up to two times their own strength. Owner recognition effects for weapons were required for warriors at this level. Strength level that was above the Divine Grade might have a chance of destroying the magic weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Magic Weapons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected to refine some Magic Weapons, nor did he know why they could rival the small towers. Though he said it like that, his creations seemed to be even more powerful than the towers. Of course, these advantages were only up to a certain extent. For example, only the enhanced strength from the Magic Weapons was more significant than the small towers’. Thus, if it wasn’t because of the limitations, the magic weapons might totally surpass the small towers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, Warriors of the False God and Divine Grade Realm were like phoenix feather and unicorn horns across the World of the Nine Continents. Even for the Martial Emperor and the Martial Saint Warriors, there was only one person in ten thousand with this level of cultivation. Hence, from here, it could be seen that Qing Shui’s creations were very precious. After all, even for the aristocratic clans, only a minority of the Warriors could achieve the False God or even Divine Grade Realms. If by any chance, there happened to be more than ten Warriors with the level of Divine Grade or False God in a clan, the clan must have prayed very sincerely to their ancestors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Magic Weapons, the user could definitely kill an equal level enemy instantly. As an example, for the warriors below the Martial Saint level, a two folds strength enhancement and the ability to deflect damages twice their own’s, were enough for them to be unbeatable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A two times boosts overall … Speed, endurance, vitality and defensive prowess…… For warriors on the same level, it was no longer something which could be made up by mere numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two months inside the realm, Qing Shui had managed to refine about fifty of them. They were already at an amount which was overabundant for the people of the Qing Clan. Qing Shui looked at all these Magic Weapons. Unfortunately, he didn’t have any decent upgrading materials. Otherwise, even he himself might be able to use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that there was still time, Qing Shui immediately began to refine the Opportunity Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Opportunity Pills were too mysterious, which was how Qing Shui knew that it must be a decent stuff. Qing Shui had high hope for this pill. He knew that luck was made for those who were well-prepared. It took a very important factor into account, which was the innate talent and ability of the person taking it. The Opportunity Pill, in the end, was still a medicinal pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t lack people with outstanding talents around him. Hence, to him, the Opportunity Pill was still something of importance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Failed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the failed pill in shock. It had been a long time since he last experienced it. As long as the prescription was right and he managed to collect the right amount of materials, it was almost as if he wouldn’t fail. But now, he clearly did, which caused him to come to a stop. Could it be that something had gone wrong with the prescriptions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the prescriptions. He believed in Yuan Su. Since she said that it was done, she must have felt that there was no problem with the prescription.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qing Shui’s eyes turned bright. He took out the herbs and once again cleansed them with his Spiritual Qi. After that, he took out the Golden Snake Grass. Qing Shui had almost forgotten about the Golden Snake Grass. Also, he had always had faith in his ability to refine medicines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, maybe because Qing Shui cleansed the herbs a few times, or added in the Golden Snake Grass, following the clear and loud noise, Qing Shui knew that he succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, Qing Shui left behind quite a lot of the Golden Snake Grass to Yuan Su. He remembered that she hadn’t refined it successfully even after a few tries. Under normal circumstances, Yuan Su would add the Golden Snake Grass on her last try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Snake Grass only doubled the success rate. If in the past, the chances of refining the medicine were 10%, doubling it would be 20%. Qing Shui really couldn’t help but compliment the alchemists on their success rate to make those pills. Thinking back to all those decent medicinal pills that they made, how many best quality herbs had they wasted in order to succeed once?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a medicinal pill with violet qi, almost the size of a thumb, translucent and sparkling. Abundant Spiritual Qi could be felt emitting from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kept it back to the jade bottle which he usually used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui refined three of them. Though they were not considered a lot, they definitely weren’t considered too little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the time was almost up, Qing Shui finished all the medicinal herbs which Yuan Su prepared for him. He managed to refine about 30 of them in total, which was already considered to be quite a lot. Everyone could only take one of these pills in their lifetime. Whether or not its effect was significant would depend on one’s luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he came out of the realm, it was at the time for afternoon teas. The majority of the people from the Qing Clan were all cultivating. Qing Shui, on the other hand, was heading towards the courtyard where Hai Dongqing resided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he entered the small yard, the only thing he saw was Hai Dongqing standing blankly by the pond. She didn’t notice Qing Shui when he came in.</span></p>
