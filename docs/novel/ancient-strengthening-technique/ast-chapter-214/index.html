 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 214 – Lass, kill them directly if you see this bunch of people in the future again.</strong></p>
  <p>Seeing Canghai Mingyue’s hesitant reply, Qing Shui smiled and said to her, “Do you want to cook something delicious for your parents for once? It wasn’t easy for them to bring you up and to nurture you so well over the years.”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was speechless. She finally knew how mischievous Qing Shui was, bringing her parents into the conversation. Not only that, he first sealed his own path of retreat, but the words about her parents bringing her up sounded extremely weird for her.</p>
  <p>“Come, let’s return. I will cook the dishes today, but you have to be my assistant.” Canghai Mingyue lightly smiled.</p>
  <p>As the three of them returned home, the two words ‘Cang Hai’ which were imprinted, left a very deep impression on the door. Qing Shui didn’t know how powerful Canghai Mingyue’s father was. Qing Shui somehow sensed that he was extremely powerful. He recalled his words, saying that any troubles in the Southern City could be resolved just by saying his name.</p>
  <p>“You guys are back. Let me cook the dishes today, so just wait for a little while and the food will be ready.” Canghai Mingyue’s mom gently said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui sighed. This was what heartwarming meant. This was a simple joy that came from just interacting with family. Their family wasn’t too poor to hire servants. They would usually cook their own meals. Qing Shui tasted their food once before. Although it couldn’t be compared to the food cooked by a chef from a great restaurant, the emotions felt from eating the food couldn’t be found anywhere else.</p>
  <p>“Mom, let me do it.” Canghai Mingyue unnaturally whispered.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue’s mom was stunned as she stared at her, startled before reaching out her hand and cradling her delicate face.</p>
  <p>“Mom, you go take a rest first. Your daughter has already learnt how to cook. Today, I shall prepare the meals for you and father to taste.”</p>
  <p>As she spoke, Canghai Mingyue made her way to the kitchen. Huoyun Liu-Li left automatically as she knew that Qing Shui wanted to be alone with Canghai Mingyue. Thus, she didn’t want to obstruct them.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, where are you going? You are going to be my helper.” Canghai Mingyue pouted.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui also planned to leave after seeing Huoyun Liu-Li leaving.<br></p>
  <p>In the end, he could only smile bitterly as he followed Canghai Mingyue into the kitchen!</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Since Canghai Mingyue promised her mom that she would cook the dishes today, so how could she still let Qing Shui escape? Under Huoyun’s smile as well as the bizarre look on Canghai Mingyue’s mom’s face, Canghai Mingyue pulled Qing Shui into the kitchen.</p>
  <p>“What do you intend to cook? Stop being so barbaric, I don’t like people who are so tyrannical. Be more gentle next time, okay?” Qing Shui murmured.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue’s countenance turned pink after hearing Qing Shui’s words. This little bad egg caused her to lose face in front of her own mother. He had already agreed to be her helper, and he still actually wanted to sneak away at the crucial moment. What could she do without him…?</p>
  <p>In the kitchen, Canghai Mingyue gazed dumbly at the basket full of vegetables as well as all the kitchen equipment. She embarrassedly turned her gaze towards Qing Shui as she had no idea where to begin.</p>
  <p>“Choose one, either I cook the dishes or I teach you how to cook them. If I’m the chef, you would definitely feel as though you were lying to your mother. Although there are no evil intentions, her feelings would still be hurt…”</p>
  <p>“Ah, you teach me then.” Canghai Mingyue speechlessly gazed at Qing Shui. This little bad egg still made her choose when the answer was already obvious.</p>
  <p>“Wear the apron first!” Qing Shui commanded. </p>
  <p>The feel of a homely woman drifted out of Canghai Mingyue the moment she put on the apron, causing Qing Shui to be mesmerised. Whoever that could marry such a woman would surely be considered blessed by the heavens.</p>
  <p>“Go sort out the veggies, and throw all the rotten ones into this basket.” Qing Shui instructed step by step, as he admired the goddess-level beauty moving about the kitchen trying to prepare the dishes. Qing Shui loved it most when a woman caused him to feel warmth in his heart. For example, when a woman was cooking for her family, he didn’t know what his preference could be considered as.</p>
  <p>As long as a woman was beautiful, no matter what actions she made, they would still look good. Even when she was blurred, and acted as though she was a culinary expert, Canghai Mingyue still looked spectacular. If she was willing to learn and improve while being sincere, it was already sufficient to him.</p>
  <p>When the time came for cutting the vegetable, Qing Shui realised that this goddess who loved to dance with her swords, was actually inept at using a kitchen knife. Looking at the clumsy movements of hers caused a smile to bloom on his face, as his laughter resounded out.</p>
  <p>“Why are you still laughing? This is my first time. Did I make any mistake?” Canghai Mingyue grew red as she pouted.</p>
  <p>“There’s technique when using a cutting knife. Watch me.” Qing Shui placed his hands over hers, and began teaching her the ways of chopping the vegetables. Only after half the veggies were chopped did he relinquish his hold of Canghai Mingyue’s hands.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t know where he got the guts from. Perhaps, it was from a moment of impulse. However, he didn’t intentionally take advantage of her. Other than grabbing her hands, and ‘accidentally’ brushing his manhood against her perky butt, Qing Shui didn’t do anything else…</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue could only hear the gentle voice of Qing Shui giving instructions as she soon mastered the art of chopping vegetables. Joyfully smiling, she let out peals of laughter as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>The next step was much simplier. Qing Shui specially took out his own condiments for seasoning and passed them to Canghai Mingyue. When the familiar fragrance came out, Qing Shui knew that this must be some of the Drunken Fragrance Fruits as well as other special ingredients that he had also passed to Huoyun back then.</p>
  <p>Just from smelling the fragrance that whetted appetite, Canghai Mingyue already felt 50% successful. When the seasoning and the colour of the cooked veggies was right, she prepared to serve the food. This was the first time she cooked, and not only that, she was cooking for her parents.</p>
  <p>At the dining table, Canghai Mingyue’s parents had a disbelieving look on their faces as they gazed at Canghai Mingyue!</p>
  <p>“Lass, from the look of the vegetable dish, I could tell that you are the one who made it. However, I don’t believe that you could actually create such a taste.” Canghai Mingyue’s father teased her.</p>
  <p>Huoyun smiled widely. She was very certain that the look of this dish could be compared to her disastrous first attempt as well. Yet despite the look, the taste of the vegetables was extremely delicious. Just like now, who could believed that such ugly looking vegetables would actually taste so awesome.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue happily took in the reactions of the others as satisfaction bloomed in her heart. At the same time, she also smiled at Qing Shui, feeling gracious to him for giving her a chance like this while also teaching her a method to be happy. So it turned out that achieving happiness was something so simple.</p>
  <p>Just when the mood was extremely pleasant, a harsh voice rang out from outside, “The people from the Canghai Clan, f*cking roll out for me.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui noticed a look of unhappiness on the face of Canghai Mingyue but she recovered quickly as she continued, “Let’s go out to take a look, it’s been a long time since I ‘exercised’. I wonder which blind fools came up to our door today.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue’s mom gazed at her as she smiled. The smile of that woman was filled with warmth and gentleness. The most important thing was that in her eyes, support and trust could also be seen.</p>
  <p>The few of them walked out of the living room and saw a group of white-robed men wielding long swords. Qing Shui estimated that there were over 100 people, and the five leaders were all middle-aged, about 50+ years old.</p>
  <p>In the crowd, Qing Shui noticed Elder Feng’s grandson and the middle aged man from before. Qing Shui then gazed at Canghai Mingyue as he discovered that she was nervously glancing at her father.</p>
  <p> “Grandpa, he was the one that injured our Sword Deity Sect’s disciple.” Feng Shao gazed at the shady middle aged man as he pointed his finger at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Grandpa, they were the ones who were rude to me originally.” Canghai Mingyue saw the other party targeting Qing Shui and thus she hurriedly tried to defend him.</p>
  <p>“Grandpa, I want that guy to die. Today, I must bring her away.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui speechlessly glanced at the guy named Feng Shao. This was the first time he met such an idiot. He always thought that idiots like these only existed in books but to think that they existed in reality as well. The feeling of bullying people and snatching girls should be very satisfying, right?</p>
  <p>Canghai glanced at his apprehensive daughter as he extended his hands to pat Canghai Mingyue on her head. “Lass, in the future if you see these bunch of ruffians that couldn’t even be compared to pigs and doors, just kill them directly.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he perspired madly in his heart. The words of Canghai was more imposing than Feng Shao’s. What arrogance, what charm. Qing Shui didn’t know how strong Canghai was, but he felt good after hearing those words. Correction. He felt extremely good.</p>
  <p>The words of Canghai Mingyue’s father caused the leaders of this mob to be startled. From Qing Shui’s perspective, their cultivation should be roughly on the same level as Canghai Mingyue’s mom, at the Martial King level.</p>
  <p>Not only that, there were quite a few of them. Qing Shui knew that one of them was the Elder from the Sword Deity Sect. The initially nervous Canghai Mingyue now hugged her father’s arm as though she was a happy child that was doted upon.</p>
  <p>“You are Canghai Canghai?” The guy that was called “Grandpa” by Feng Shao stepped forward as he inquired.</p>
  <p>“In these 30 years, no one has dared to barge in the great door of my Canghai’s residence. No one has dared to call my full name directly in front of me.” Canghai Mingyue’s dad didn’t even gaze at the number of people standing in front of him. He was smiling as he gazed at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“Elder Feng, many people enjoy false reputations. Not only that, have you heard of the name Canghai Canghai? WHO IN THIS REGION WOULD MY SWORD DEITY SECT FEAR??” A man with hawk-like eyes and nose sneered loudly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s countenance didn’t change. He smiled peacefully at everything as a rock was clutched in one of his hands while the other was holding on a golden needle.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was entranced by the calm countenance and soothing aura Qing Shui exuded even under so much pressure!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, in reality, had long secretly observed the countenance of Canghai Mingyue’s parents. Qing Shui already knew that her dad was very powerful and naturally could also tell the standards of this mob of ruffians. The most important clue was that there was no change in the expression of Canghai Mingyue’s mom. After analysing all the clues, Qing Shui discarded all his worries because he knew that the Canghai couple didn’t even put these opponents in their eyes.</p>
  <p>“Seems like if I don’t give you something to remember, all of you will only go overboard.” Canghai Canghai smiled as his silhouette turned blurry, appearing beside Elder Feng in an instant. Both of his hands moved like a mirage as he executed his techniques with a speed as fast as lightning.</p>
  <p>“Boom!”</p>
  <p>In an instant, Qing Shui saw the manifestation of a brilliance that seemed akin to two green dragons tearing the void as they flew forward. After which, Canghai’s body flickered yet again as he returned to his original spot. In the eyes of normal humans, it was as though he had never moved from that spot.</p>
  <p>For Qing Shui, he saw each and every movement clearly despite the fact that Qing Shui’s current speed could still not be compared to Canghai. He even had the aid of Deer Cantering as well as the Agility Fruit and Small Revitalizing Pellets.</p>
  <p>Not only that, Qing Shui also speculated that Canghai definitely had a Black Treasured Stone on his body, and the level of it should be quite high.</p>
  <p>In that instant, Qing Shui understood that the skills used by Canghai Canghai was the Heavenly Thunder Slash from the Heaven’s Palace. This power was exceptionally strong. In that instant, Qing Shui felt as though he guessed something correctly, but he was still unsure if his guesses were correct.</p>
  <p>Looking at the 100 man squad once again, they were all in a mess. That Elder Feng laid unceremoniously on the ground with blood all over his body. Even that hawk-eyed man from earlier was also staring at Canghai with disbelief as he spat out three words, “You are ruthless!” </p>
  <p>“Ruthless? Haha, crippling your cultivation base should be enough. Go back and ask the ancestor of your Sword Deity Sect and you will understand how merciful I was today. This price is too light, but I guess it couldn’t be helped. I grew rusty after 10 years of rest.” Canghai laughed.</p>
  <p>The rest of them, especially the white-robed leaders, knew that they rammed into nails today upon hearing Canghai mentioning their ancestor. When they get back, they would most likely be scolded. Being scolded was a small thing, but the important thing was that they actually lost two Elders.</p>
  <p>“You can leave. I didn’t think that there would be people who dared to ride on top of my head, and even planned to make a move against my daughter. You must be tired of living. F*ck off now, I don’t wish to kill today.” Canghai casually spoke.</p>
  <p>“Useless bunch of trash, they’re all rubbish. Lass, remember this, if you see them again, kill them directly. Save trouble for yourself. If you can’t beat them, let me know. I will dismantle the Sword Deity Sect for you.” Canghai laughed.</p>
  <p>“Mhm, Father is the best.” Canghai Mingyue happily exclaimed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui sighed as he witnessed the difference between realms. Initially, he had already felt that there was a huge difference in power when merely comparing one level of Xiantian to the next. Today, he could clearly sense the distance between Xiantian and Martial King. The gulf was too astronomical. Qing Shui didn’t know what level of strength Canghai was actually at, but he could tell that Elder Feng should be at the beginning levels of Martial King.</p>
  <p>Not only that, Canghai instantly slayed a Martial King level expert. This was what the truly strong were like. Witnessing this only gave Qing Shui the determination and motivation to advance even further.</p>
  <p>If he had this level of strength, he could have gone to the Yan Clan and trample them. There was no need for him to be in such agony. His mother Qing Yi already suffered enough. Every time he thought of her, he couldn’t help but feel like rushing straight to the Yan Clan.</p>
  <p>He wanted to tell the Yan Clan that they needed to pay for what they have done. Not only that, they have to pay back 100 times more or even 1,000 times more. This was the only way to even mitigate the pain and loss Qing Yi felt back then.</p>
  <p>At the same time, Qing Shui also tried guessing Canghai’s actual level of strength. But, he speculated that not even Canghai Mingyue knew what her father’s true strength was.</p>
  <p>A mysterious male with power akin to a god. Only he would have a daughter like Canghai Mingyue. He was willing to block wind and rain for her and give a piece of the warm skies and an excellent starting point.</p>
  <p>In the future, the man she marries must be someone like her father. In this life, the man beside her must most certainly be one of those peerless legends that could stand tall within all of the nine continents!</p>

 <p>As the three of them returned home, the two words ‘Cang Hai’ which were imprinted, left a very deep impression on the door. Qing Shui didn’t know how powerful Canghai Mingyue’s father was. Qing Shui somehow sensed that he was extremely powerful. He recalled his words, saying that any troubles in the Southern City could be resolved just by saying his name.</p>
 <p>“You guys are back. Let me cook the dishes today, so just wait for a little while and the food will be ready.” Canghai Mingyue’s mom gently said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sighed. This was what heartwarming meant. This was a simple joy that came from just interacting with family. Their family wasn’t too poor to hire servants. They would usually cook their own meals. Qing Shui tasted their food once before. Although it couldn’t be compared to the food cooked by a chef from a great restaurant, the emotions felt from eating the food couldn’t be found anywhere else.</p>
 <p>“Mom, let me do it.” Canghai Mingyue unnaturally whispered.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue’s mom was stunned as she stared at her, startled before reaching out her hand and cradling her delicate face.</p>
 <p>“Mom, you go take a rest first. Your daughter has already learnt how to cook. Today, I shall prepare the meals for you and father to taste.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, Canghai Mingyue made her way to the kitchen. Huoyun Liu-Li left automatically as she knew that Qing Shui wanted to be alone with Canghai Mingyue. Thus, she didn’t want to obstruct them.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, where are you going? You are going to be my helper.” Canghai Mingyue pouted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also planned to leave after seeing Huoyun Liu-Li leaving.<br></p>
 <p>In the end, he could only smile bitterly as he followed Canghai Mingyue into the kitchen!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Since Canghai Mingyue promised her mom that she would cook the dishes today, so how could she still let Qing Shui escape? Under Huoyun’s smile as well as the bizarre look on Canghai Mingyue’s mom’s face, Canghai Mingyue pulled Qing Shui into the kitchen.</p>
 <p>“What do you intend to cook? Stop being so barbaric, I don’t like people who are so tyrannical. Be more gentle next time, okay?” Qing Shui murmured.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue’s countenance turned pink after hearing Qing Shui’s words. This little bad egg caused her to lose face in front of her own mother. He had already agreed to be her helper, and he still actually wanted to sneak away at the crucial moment. What could she do without him…?</p>
 <p>In the kitchen, Canghai Mingyue gazed dumbly at the basket full of vegetables as well as all the kitchen equipment. She embarrassedly turned her gaze towards Qing Shui as she had no idea where to begin.</p>
 <p>“Choose one, either I cook the dishes or I teach you how to cook them. If I’m the chef, you would definitely feel as though you were lying to your mother. Although there are no evil intentions, her feelings would still be hurt…”</p>
 <p>“Ah, you teach me then.” Canghai Mingyue speechlessly gazed at Qing Shui. This little bad egg still made her choose when the answer was already obvious.</p>
 <p>“Wear the apron first!” Qing Shui commanded. </p>
 <p>The feel of a homely woman drifted out of Canghai Mingyue the moment she put on the apron, causing Qing Shui to be mesmerised. Whoever that could marry such a woman would surely be considered blessed by the heavens.</p>
 <p>“Go sort out the veggies, and throw all the rotten ones into this basket.” Qing Shui instructed step by step, as he admired the goddess-level beauty moving about the kitchen trying to prepare the dishes. Qing Shui loved it most when a woman caused him to feel warmth in his heart. For example, when a woman was cooking for her family, he didn’t know what his preference could be considered as.</p>
 <p>As long as a woman was beautiful, no matter what actions she made, they would still look good. Even when she was blurred, and acted as though she was a culinary expert, Canghai Mingyue still looked spectacular. If she was willing to learn and improve while being sincere, it was already sufficient to him.</p>
 <p>When the time came for cutting the vegetable, Qing Shui realised that this goddess who loved to dance with her swords, was actually inept at using a kitchen knife. Looking at the clumsy movements of hers caused a smile to bloom on his face, as his laughter resounded out.</p>
 <p>“Why are you still laughing? This is my first time. Did I make any mistake?” Canghai Mingyue grew red as she pouted.</p>
 <p>“There’s technique when using a cutting knife. Watch me.” Qing Shui placed his hands over hers, and began teaching her the ways of chopping the vegetables. Only after half the veggies were chopped did he relinquish his hold of Canghai Mingyue’s hands.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know where he got the guts from. Perhaps, it was from a moment of impulse. However, he didn’t intentionally take advantage of her. Other than grabbing her hands, and ‘accidentally’ brushing his manhood against her perky butt, Qing Shui didn’t do anything else…</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue could only hear the gentle voice of Qing Shui giving instructions as she soon mastered the art of chopping vegetables. Joyfully smiling, she let out peals of laughter as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The next step was much simplier. Qing Shui specially took out his own condiments for seasoning and passed them to Canghai Mingyue. When the familiar fragrance came out, Qing Shui knew that this must be some of the Drunken Fragrance Fruits as well as other special ingredients that he had also passed to Huoyun back then.</p>
 <p>Just from smelling the fragrance that whetted appetite, Canghai Mingyue already felt 50% successful. When the seasoning and the colour of the cooked veggies was right, she prepared to serve the food. This was the first time she cooked, and not only that, she was cooking for her parents.</p>
 <p>At the dining table, Canghai Mingyue’s parents had a disbelieving look on their faces as they gazed at Canghai Mingyue!</p>
 <p>“Lass, from the look of the vegetable dish, I could tell that you are the one who made it. However, I don’t believe that you could actually create such a taste.” Canghai Mingyue’s father teased her.</p>
 <p>Huoyun smiled widely. She was very certain that the look of this dish could be compared to her disastrous first attempt as well. Yet despite the look, the taste of the vegetables was extremely delicious. Just like now, who could believed that such ugly looking vegetables would actually taste so awesome.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue happily took in the reactions of the others as satisfaction bloomed in her heart. At the same time, she also smiled at Qing Shui, feeling gracious to him for giving her a chance like this while also teaching her a method to be happy. So it turned out that achieving happiness was something so simple.</p>
 <p>Just when the mood was extremely pleasant, a harsh voice rang out from outside, “The people from the Canghai Clan, f*cking roll out for me.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed a look of unhappiness on the face of Canghai Mingyue but she recovered quickly as she continued, “Let’s go out to take a look, it’s been a long time since I ‘exercised’. I wonder which blind fools came up to our door today.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue’s mom gazed at her as she smiled. The smile of that woman was filled with warmth and gentleness. The most important thing was that in her eyes, support and trust could also be seen.</p>
 <p>The few of them walked out of the living room and saw a group of white-robed men wielding long swords. Qing Shui estimated that there were over 100 people, and the five leaders were all middle-aged, about 50+ years old.</p>
 <p>In the crowd, Qing Shui noticed Elder Feng’s grandson and the middle aged man from before. Qing Shui then gazed at Canghai Mingyue as he discovered that she was nervously glancing at her father.</p>
 <p> “Grandpa, he was the one that injured our Sword Deity Sect’s disciple.” Feng Shao gazed at the shady middle aged man as he pointed his finger at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, they were the ones who were rude to me originally.” Canghai Mingyue saw the other party targeting Qing Shui and thus she hurriedly tried to defend him.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, I want that guy to die. Today, I must bring her away.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui speechlessly glanced at the guy named Feng Shao. This was the first time he met such an idiot. He always thought that idiots like these only existed in books but to think that they existed in reality as well. The feeling of bullying people and snatching girls should be very satisfying, right?</p>
 <p>Canghai glanced at his apprehensive daughter as he extended his hands to pat Canghai Mingyue on her head. “Lass, in the future if you see these bunch of ruffians that couldn’t even be compared to pigs and doors, just kill them directly.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he perspired madly in his heart. The words of Canghai was more imposing than Feng Shao’s. What arrogance, what charm. Qing Shui didn’t know how strong Canghai was, but he felt good after hearing those words. Correction. He felt extremely good.</p>
 <p>The words of Canghai Mingyue’s father caused the leaders of this mob to be startled. From Qing Shui’s perspective, their cultivation should be roughly on the same level as Canghai Mingyue’s mom, at the Martial King level.</p>
 <p>Not only that, there were quite a few of them. Qing Shui knew that one of them was the Elder from the Sword Deity Sect. The initially nervous Canghai Mingyue now hugged her father’s arm as though she was a happy child that was doted upon.</p>
 <p>“You are Canghai Canghai?” The guy that was called “Grandpa” by Feng Shao stepped forward as he inquired.</p>
 <p>“In these 30 years, no one has dared to barge in the great door of my Canghai’s residence. No one has dared to call my full name directly in front of me.” Canghai Mingyue’s dad didn’t even gaze at the number of people standing in front of him. He was smiling as he gazed at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“Elder Feng, many people enjoy false reputations. Not only that, have you heard of the name Canghai Canghai? WHO IN THIS REGION WOULD MY SWORD DEITY SECT FEAR??” A man with hawk-like eyes and nose sneered loudly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s countenance didn’t change. He smiled peacefully at everything as a rock was clutched in one of his hands while the other was holding on a golden needle.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue was entranced by the calm countenance and soothing aura Qing Shui exuded even under so much pressure!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, in reality, had long secretly observed the countenance of Canghai Mingyue’s parents. Qing Shui already knew that her dad was very powerful and naturally could also tell the standards of this mob of ruffians. The most important clue was that there was no change in the expression of Canghai Mingyue’s mom. After analysing all the clues, Qing Shui discarded all his worries because he knew that the Canghai couple didn’t even put these opponents in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Seems like if I don’t give you something to remember, all of you will only go overboard.” Canghai Canghai smiled as his silhouette turned blurry, appearing beside Elder Feng in an instant. Both of his hands moved like a mirage as he executed his techniques with a speed as fast as lightning.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>In an instant, Qing Shui saw the manifestation of a brilliance that seemed akin to two green dragons tearing the void as they flew forward. After which, Canghai’s body flickered yet again as he returned to his original spot. In the eyes of normal humans, it was as though he had never moved from that spot.</p>
 <p>For Qing Shui, he saw each and every movement clearly despite the fact that Qing Shui’s current speed could still not be compared to Canghai. He even had the aid of Deer Cantering as well as the Agility Fruit and Small Revitalizing Pellets.</p>
 <p>Not only that, Qing Shui also speculated that Canghai definitely had a Black Treasured Stone on his body, and the level of it should be quite high.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Qing Shui understood that the skills used by Canghai Canghai was the Heavenly Thunder Slash from the Heaven’s Palace. This power was exceptionally strong. In that instant, Qing Shui felt as though he guessed something correctly, but he was still unsure if his guesses were correct.</p>
 <p>Looking at the 100 man squad once again, they were all in a mess. That Elder Feng laid unceremoniously on the ground with blood all over his body. Even that hawk-eyed man from earlier was also staring at Canghai with disbelief as he spat out three words, “You are ruthless!” </p>
 <p>“Ruthless? Haha, crippling your cultivation base should be enough. Go back and ask the ancestor of your Sword Deity Sect and you will understand how merciful I was today. This price is too light, but I guess it couldn’t be helped. I grew rusty after 10 years of rest.” Canghai laughed.</p>
 <p>The rest of them, especially the white-robed leaders, knew that they rammed into nails today upon hearing Canghai mentioning their ancestor. When they get back, they would most likely be scolded. Being scolded was a small thing, but the important thing was that they actually lost two Elders.</p>
 <p>“You can leave. I didn’t think that there would be people who dared to ride on top of my head, and even planned to make a move against my daughter. You must be tired of living. F*ck off now, I don’t wish to kill today.” Canghai casually spoke.</p>
 <p>“Useless bunch of trash, they’re all rubbish. Lass, remember this, if you see them again, kill them directly. Save trouble for yourself. If you can’t beat them, let me know. I will dismantle the Sword Deity Sect for you.” Canghai laughed.</p>
 <p>“Mhm, Father is the best.” Canghai Mingyue happily exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sighed as he witnessed the difference between realms. Initially, he had already felt that there was a huge difference in power when merely comparing one level of Xiantian to the next. Today, he could clearly sense the distance between Xiantian and Martial King. The gulf was too astronomical. Qing Shui didn’t know what level of strength Canghai was actually at, but he could tell that Elder Feng should be at the beginning levels of Martial King.</p>
 <p>Not only that, Canghai instantly slayed a Martial King level expert. This was what the truly strong were like. Witnessing this only gave Qing Shui the determination and motivation to advance even further.</p>
 <p>If he had this level of strength, he could have gone to the Yan Clan and trample them. There was no need for him to be in such agony. His mother Qing Yi already suffered enough. Every time he thought of her, he couldn’t help but feel like rushing straight to the Yan Clan.</p>
 <p>He wanted to tell the Yan Clan that they needed to pay for what they have done. Not only that, they have to pay back 100 times more or even 1,000 times more. This was the only way to even mitigate the pain and loss Qing Yi felt back then.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui also tried guessing Canghai’s actual level of strength. But, he speculated that not even Canghai Mingyue knew what her father’s true strength was.</p>
 <p>A mysterious male with power akin to a god. Only he would have a daughter like Canghai Mingyue. He was willing to block wind and rain for her and give a piece of the warm skies and an excellent starting point.</p>
 <p>In the future, the man she marries must be someone like her father. In this life, the man beside her must most certainly be one of those peerless legends that could stand tall within all of the nine continents!</p>
