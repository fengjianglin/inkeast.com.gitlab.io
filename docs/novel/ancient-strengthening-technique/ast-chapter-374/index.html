 <p><strong>Chapter 374 A Display of Smile, Divine Arm Clearing Technique of Large Success Stage and Divine Feet Clearing Technique of Small Success Stage.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>374 - A Display of Smile, Divine Arm Clearing Technique of Large Success Stage and Divine Feet Clearing Technique of Small Success Stage</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is the first time I had to travel incessantly over someone.” Her melodious voice rang out with a comforting aura.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She didn’t do anything when she said this, but the tone of her voice was laced with a hint of helplessness!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This made Qing Shui extremely puzzled!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How did you know that I was in danger? I didn’t even sense it myself.” Qing Shui asked the question that had been bothering him. He had originally thought that this coincidence was because someone from the Heavenly Palace was watching the Medicine King Aristocrat Clan’s and found out about their movements.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress turned around to look at him after he asked his question. A pure white veil covered her extremely gorgeous face, revealing only those beautiful eyes that Qing Shui could never get enough of, even if he had seen them a million times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui simply couldn’t explain the beauty of those orbs. They had Yiye Jiange’s exceptional elegance and purity, yet at the same time, not losing the graceful temperament that could topple empires.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt a little nervous under that otherworldly gaze and he had never been this nervous, not even in front of Yiye Jiange and Canghai Mingyue. He tried to remain calm and collected as he quietly evaded the gaze that was akin to the first glimmer of dawn.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I sensed a dangerous aura. This annoying telepathy...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart skipped a beat when he remembered about the subtle telepathic feeling between them. He thought that it should be severed between them over such a long distance. Perhaps this resonance was overly intense because it was a moment of life and death.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt quite flattered about the arrival of Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress, although he really didn’t quite understand why she’d come all this way to save him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was just wondering about her strength. He thought about the old man’s display of strength from just now and then associated it to the powerful strength of the Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She really crippled a cultivator at the pinnacle of Martial King Grade 8 with one technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could she be a cultivator at the pinnacle of Martial King Grade 10?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">How old was she? Why was she wearing a veil?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at the mysterious lady in a daze, she was like a riddle. For a moment he could feel emotion being stirred up in his heart. She was indeed a lady who was as powerful as God.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had only realized now that aside from knowing that she was the Palace Mistress of the Misty Hall, he didn’t know anything else about her. As for the amazing telepathy between them, it should have something to do with that portrait of beauty in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment Qing Shui didn’t know what he should say to her. He couldn’t bring himself to say some useless words, but he didn’t have any useful words. He had thanked her once, should he thank her again?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In front of her, Qing Shui felt that even the most charismatic man would falter. He’d definitely be frightened by that aura of hers, which was colder than ice, along with the hint of disdain within.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was the kind of aura that would make others feel inferior! An extraordinary otherworldly aura which cannot be tainted by the world!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blue Luan landed on a hilly area.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a messy area with bushes of weeds high as the mountains. Some small wild beasts roamed about or emitted frightened cries from time to time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A breeze was gently blowing, making their clothes flutter. Qing Shui, who was standing behind, couldn’t help but to look at the lady in front of him. Qing Shui was infatuated by her grace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui… your name is Qing Shui right?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A voice that was as melodious as the chant of sacred scriptures rang out, surprising Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, that’s right. How should I address you?” Qing Shui lowered his head and gently asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This person had just saved his life. She was the mistress of one of the halls in the Heavenly Palace at which he stayed, and was also one of the cultivators who stood at the pinnacle of the Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress shook her head. “Just address me by anything you want. I felt very strange that I was able to come today too, because I had a feeling... I was afraid that I’d regret.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui wasn’t quite clear on what she meant, he had kind of understood half of it. She meant that if he had died today, she might regret in the future.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, take care of yourself in the future. I am leaving!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress told Qing Shui after a moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Leave? But you have just arrived. Come stay at my house for two days and let me properly express my gratitude!” Qing Shui hastily said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No need, I don’t like to crowd.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress looked at Qing Shui and gave him a rare faint smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although it was just a trace of smile, Qing Shui truly saw the smile in the corner of her eyes and the expression of her eyes. This made him feel like everything around him had brightened up by a lot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her peerless look was unmatched in her era and her beauty was the purest in the entire universe…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that she wouldn’t change her mind once she had made a decision. Furthermore, he didn’t have any rights to make her change her mind. However, for her to return like this after coming all the way here made him felt extremely uncomfortable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wait for moment, I have something for you!” Qing Shui said after thinking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end Qing Shui gifted her five Beast Pills to allow the innate talents of her Blue Luan to awaken. She ended up accepting quite a lot of Plum Blossom Wine and Tiger Bone Liquor along with those five Beast Pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had originally planned to give her some Spirit Concentrating Pills, but the Palace Mistress conveniently passed him a bottle of it instead. She told him that most of them had been used up and she was left with only very few, so she gave them to Qing Shui along with the bottle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He took a look and discovered that they were actually the very same type of Spirit Concentrating Pills that he had, except that their effects were threefolds or sixfolds…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He watched as the size of the Blue Luan gradually shrank into the distance until it vanished, along with the lady on the portrait of beauty!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking down at the Spirit Concentrating Pills in his hand, he counted more than thirty of them. This should be enough to last him alone for a month. The bottle was more than half empty. It seemed like she had used up quite a number of it because there should initially have been about a hundred of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">To think that she had taken some of his medicine pills, and that he would also be taking some of her’s, made Qing Shui’s heart palpitated a little. Yet, at the same time, he was also secretly blaming himself for his impure thoughts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Screech screech!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s summon was answered! Fire Bird arrived swiftly from a distance after a short while!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Risk and benefit co-existed. To think that his Divine Arm Clearing Technique had actually broke through to the Great Perfection Stage; this should be considered a reward. Only half a year remained. He was hoping that he could bring it to the Grand Perfection Stage, and even better, his Divine Feet Clearing Technique could attain the Grand Perfection Stage. That way, his strength would be raised to a satisfying level before he headed towards the Yan Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wait for another half a year. After half a year, I’d definitely have the confidence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spoke quietly as if he was talking to himself, or more accurately, like he was making a resolution to himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By the time he returned to the Qing Residence, everyone was there. They all had a smile on their face upon seeing Qing Shui’s return, along with some worried expressions. Those heartfelt looks made Qing Shui felt especially warm.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, where is that lady?” Qing Yi asked, pulling on his hand and gripping it tightly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She went back!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Brother Qing, Sister-In-Law Qingzhuang just left. She said she’ll come over later again.” Qing Bei came over to inform while happily held on to Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…………………………………………………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As time marched on, a week had passed. The discussion about Qing Shui in the Hundred Miles City was still animated. After all, for such a small city to have a Martial King Grade cultivator was truly the Hundred Miles City’s honor. The position of the Hundred Miles City was no longer the same as in the past. The incidents of passing cultivators being injured in the Hundred Miles City had also lessened dramatically, to the point of nearly dissipating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such was a high level cultivator’s influence to a city, a country, even a continent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood straightly there, frowning in his thoughts from time to time and then closing his eyes to circulate his Qi. &nbsp;After a short while, he frowned in deep thoughts once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had been using the Spirit Concentrating Pills from the Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress and cultivated the Divine Feet Clearing Technique for a week. He used Spirit Concentrating Pills with sixfold effects in addition to the heaven-defying effect of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A week’s time here was equivalent to more than half a year’s time. This was Qing Shui’s advantage, his advantage in time. Although many heaven-defying things existed on the continent, they were still considered to be rare and Qing Shui was fortunate.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The end results of this half a year in addition to the Spirit Concentrating Pills with sixfold effects was downright outrageous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel an impending breakthrough and persevered. During this period of cultivation, his Ancient Strengthening Technique had also broke through to the 120th cycle, causing the energy in his body to once again improve immensely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Over the span of this one week, which was about two years in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal in addition to the effects of the Spirit Concentrating Pills. The “Nature Energy” had broke through once in between. Qing Shui didn’t know how to differentiate his own Nature Energy, but the “energy” in his body had increased four to five times more than before so he realised that his speed had increased quite significantly when he was cultivating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was aware that in order to gain a social standing on the Greencloud Continent, he’d at least need to reach the peak of the Fifth Heavenly Layer. By that time, he should be able to fight a Martial King Grade 10 evenly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The distance to the Fifth Heavenly Layer was still 80 cycles away. At the rate of one cycle per year, he’d need 80 years more. If this was converted to within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, he’d still need approximately 7 years…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He clenched his teeth as he diligently cultivated the Divine Feet Clearing Technique. Clearing Acupuncture Points was a painful matter because one would need to endure the pain and powerlessness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cultivating the Divine Feet Clearing Technique was more difficult compared to the Divine Arm Clearing Technique. Qing Shui didn’t know the reason, but he was guessing that it could be related to his Solitary Rapid Fist Technique cultivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Futu, Zusanli, and Fenglong acupoints on his legs were becoming increasingly numb and accompanied by a burning pain. It was so much more painful than when he was cultivating the Divine Arm Clearing Technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Raising the Nature Energy to its limits, he discharged an a overwhelming pulse of energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pupupu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A breakthrough! He had attained the Small Success Stage for Divine Feet Clearing Technique! The difficulty of this Divine Feet Clearing Technique was several times of the Divine Arm Clearing Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sensation of standing in molten iron both with his legs were immediately gone. A wave of incomparably wonderful and refreshing sensations quickly covered his entire body, as well as both legs. Qing Shui was elated about the fact that the power in both of his legs had become very strong; even his entire body and spirit had grown significantly stronger. It was as if his Ancient Strengthening Technique had advanced by one cycle.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He immediately understood everything after thinking about it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Zusanli was an important acupoint to strengthen the body. It strengthened the spleen and stomach, promoted digestion, enhanced the spirit, and invigorated the qi as well!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The benefits of clearing acupuncture points were this many!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s figure shuttled around the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Speed was power. Although the Small Success Stage of Divine Feet Clearing Technique only cleared three acupoints on each leg, it had increased the strength of both legs by at least one fold. His speed had also been increased a little even though it wasn’t particularly obvious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practiced his Taichi Fists in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. An adaptation process was necessary after every breakthrough. He would always use Taichi Fists to adapt, although with different methods.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Rapid hits, slow hits, balanced hits, speed variation hits…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While practising his Taichi Fists, Qing Shui was performing Cloudmist Steps with his feet. On top of that, he was trying to unify the varying rhythms of the Taichi Fists. In this case, he wasn’t merely practising his fists techniques, but also his movement on top of it, attaining the ability to juggle two practices with a single intention.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The effect of the Spirit Concentrating Pill had expired, but Qing Shui didn’t consume another one again because he had to leave the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal in an hour. He didn’t want be wasteful.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was just wondering about her strength. He thought about the old man’s display of strength from just now and then associated it to the powerful strength of the Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She really crippled a cultivator at the pinnacle of Martial King Grade 8 with one technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Could she be a cultivator at the pinnacle of Martial King Grade 10?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">How old was she? Why was she wearing a veil?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at the mysterious lady in a daze, she was like a riddle. For a moment he could feel emotion being stirred up in his heart. She was indeed a lady who was as powerful as God.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had only realized now that aside from knowing that she was the Palace Mistress of the Misty Hall, he didn’t know anything else about her. As for the amazing telepathy between them, it should have something to do with that portrait of beauty in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment Qing Shui didn’t know what he should say to her. He couldn’t bring himself to say some useless words, but he didn’t have any useful words. He had thanked her once, should he thank her again?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In front of her, Qing Shui felt that even the most charismatic man would falter. He’d definitely be frightened by that aura of hers, which was colder than ice, along with the hint of disdain within.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was the kind of aura that would make others feel inferior! An extraordinary otherworldly aura which cannot be tainted by the world!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Blue Luan landed on a hilly area.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a messy area with bushes of weeds high as the mountains. Some small wild beasts roamed about or emitted frightened cries from time to time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A breeze was gently blowing, making their clothes flutter. Qing Shui, who was standing behind, couldn’t help but to look at the lady in front of him. Qing Shui was infatuated by her grace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui… your name is Qing Shui right?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A voice that was as melodious as the chant of sacred scriptures rang out, surprising Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, that’s right. How should I address you?” Qing Shui lowered his head and gently asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This person had just saved his life. She was the mistress of one of the halls in the Heavenly Palace at which he stayed, and was also one of the cultivators who stood at the pinnacle of the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress shook her head. “Just address me by anything you want. I felt very strange that I was able to come today too, because I had a feeling... I was afraid that I’d regret.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui wasn’t quite clear on what she meant, he had kind of understood half of it. She meant that if he had died today, she might regret in the future.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, take care of yourself in the future. I am leaving!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress told Qing Shui after a moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Leave? But you have just arrived. Come stay at my house for two days and let me properly express my gratitude!” Qing Shui hastily said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No need, I don’t like to crowd.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress looked at Qing Shui and gave him a rare faint smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although it was just a trace of smile, Qing Shui truly saw the smile in the corner of her eyes and the expression of her eyes. This made him feel like everything around him had brightened up by a lot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her peerless look was unmatched in her era and her beauty was the purest in the entire universe…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that she wouldn’t change her mind once she had made a decision. Furthermore, he didn’t have any rights to make her change her mind. However, for her to return like this after coming all the way here made him felt extremely uncomfortable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wait for moment, I have something for you!” Qing Shui said after thinking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end Qing Shui gifted her five Beast Pills to allow the innate talents of her Blue Luan to awaken. She ended up accepting quite a lot of Plum Blossom Wine and Tiger Bone Liquor along with those five Beast Pills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had originally planned to give her some Spirit Concentrating Pills, but the Palace Mistress conveniently passed him a bottle of it instead. She told him that most of them had been used up and she was left with only very few, so she gave them to Qing Shui along with the bottle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He took a look and discovered that they were actually the very same type of Spirit Concentrating Pills that he had, except that their effects were threefolds or sixfolds…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He watched as the size of the Blue Luan gradually shrank into the distance until it vanished, along with the lady on the portrait of beauty!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking down at the Spirit Concentrating Pills in his hand, he counted more than thirty of them. This should be enough to last him alone for a month. The bottle was more than half empty. It seemed like she had used up quite a number of it because there should initially have been about a hundred of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">To think that she had taken some of his medicine pills, and that he would also be taking some of her’s, made Qing Shui’s heart palpitated a little. Yet, at the same time, he was also secretly blaming himself for his impure thoughts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Screech screech!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s summon was answered! Fire Bird arrived swiftly from a distance after a short while!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Risk and benefit co-existed. To think that his Divine Arm Clearing Technique had actually broke through to the Great Perfection Stage; this should be considered a reward. Only half a year remained. He was hoping that he could bring it to the Grand Perfection Stage, and even better, his Divine Feet Clearing Technique could attain the Grand Perfection Stage. That way, his strength would be raised to a satisfying level before he headed towards the Yan Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wait for another half a year. After half a year, I’d definitely have the confidence!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spoke quietly as if he was talking to himself, or more accurately, like he was making a resolution to himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By the time he returned to the Qing Residence, everyone was there. They all had a smile on their face upon seeing Qing Shui’s return, along with some worried expressions. Those heartfelt looks made Qing Shui felt especially warm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, where is that lady?” Qing Yi asked, pulling on his hand and gripping it tightly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“She went back!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Brother Qing, Sister-In-Law Qingzhuang just left. She said she’ll come over later again.” Qing Bei came over to inform while happily held on to Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…………………………………………………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As time marched on, a week had passed. The discussion about Qing Shui in the Hundred Miles City was still animated. After all, for such a small city to have a Martial King Grade cultivator was truly the Hundred Miles City’s honor. The position of the Hundred Miles City was no longer the same as in the past. The incidents of passing cultivators being injured in the Hundred Miles City had also lessened dramatically, to the point of nearly dissipating.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Such was a high level cultivator’s influence to a city, a country, even a continent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood straightly there, frowning in his thoughts from time to time and then closing his eyes to circulate his Qi. &nbsp;After a short while, he frowned in deep thoughts once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had been using the Spirit Concentrating Pills from the Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress and cultivated the Divine Feet Clearing Technique for a week. He used Spirit Concentrating Pills with sixfold effects in addition to the heaven-defying effect of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A week’s time here was equivalent to more than half a year’s time. This was Qing Shui’s advantage, his advantage in time. Although many heaven-defying things existed on the continent, they were still considered to be rare and Qing Shui was fortunate.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The end results of this half a year in addition to the Spirit Concentrating Pills with sixfold effects was downright outrageous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel an impending breakthrough and persevered. During this period of cultivation, his Ancient Strengthening Technique had also broke through to the 120th cycle, causing the energy in his body to once again improve immensely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Over the span of this one week, which was about two years in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal in addition to the effects of the Spirit Concentrating Pills. The “Nature Energy” had broke through once in between. Qing Shui didn’t know how to differentiate his own Nature Energy, but the “energy” in his body had increased four to five times more than before so he realised that his speed had increased quite significantly when he was cultivating.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was aware that in order to gain a social standing on the Greencloud Continent, he’d at least need to reach the peak of the Fifth Heavenly Layer. By that time, he should be able to fight a Martial King Grade 10 evenly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The distance to the Fifth Heavenly Layer was still 80 cycles away. At the rate of one cycle per year, he’d need 80 years more. If this was converted to within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, he’d still need approximately 7 years…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He clenched his teeth as he diligently cultivated the Divine Feet Clearing Technique. Clearing Acupuncture Points was a painful matter because one would need to endure the pain and powerlessness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cultivating the Divine Feet Clearing Technique was more difficult compared to the Divine Arm Clearing Technique. Qing Shui didn’t know the reason, but he was guessing that it could be related to his Solitary Rapid Fist Technique cultivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Futu, Zusanli, and Fenglong acupoints on his legs were becoming increasingly numb and accompanied by a burning pain. It was so much more painful than when he was cultivating the Divine Arm Clearing Technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Raising the Nature Energy to its limits, he discharged an a overwhelming pulse of energy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pupupu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A breakthrough! He had attained the Small Success Stage for Divine Feet Clearing Technique! The difficulty of this Divine Feet Clearing Technique was several times of the Divine Arm Clearing Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sensation of standing in molten iron both with his legs were immediately gone. A wave of incomparably wonderful and refreshing sensations quickly covered his entire body, as well as both legs. Qing Shui was elated about the fact that the power in both of his legs had become very strong; even his entire body and spirit had grown significantly stronger. It was as if his Ancient Strengthening Technique had advanced by one cycle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He immediately understood everything after thinking about it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Zusanli was an important acupoint to strengthen the body. It strengthened the spleen and stomach, promoted digestion, enhanced the spirit, and invigorated the qi as well!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The benefits of clearing acupuncture points were this many!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s figure shuttled around the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Speed was power. Although the Small Success Stage of Divine Feet Clearing Technique only cleared three acupoints on each leg, it had increased the strength of both legs by at least one fold. His speed had also been increased a little even though it wasn’t particularly obvious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practiced his Taichi Fists in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. An adaptation process was necessary after every breakthrough. He would always use Taichi Fists to adapt, although with different methods.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Rapid hits, slow hits, balanced hits, speed variation hits…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While practising his Taichi Fists, Qing Shui was performing Cloudmist Steps with his feet. On top of that, he was trying to unify the varying rhythms of the Taichi Fists. In this case, he wasn’t merely practising his fists techniques, but also his movement on top of it, attaining the ability to juggle two practices with a single intention.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The effect of the Spirit Concentrating Pill had expired, but Qing Shui didn’t consume another one again because he had to leave the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal in an hour. He didn’t want be wasteful.</p>
