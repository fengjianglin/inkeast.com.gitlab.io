 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud and clear noise came through as Qing Shui slapped the Flower Demon. At this point, the Flower Demon went crazy. To think that she would get slapped by a man… The Flower Demon who originally intended to avoid him immediately charged towards him instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the Flower Demon had already lost its calm completely from being slapped by Qing Shui. The Flower Storm Strangling Formation also followed along and became unstable. The strangling formation was initially not something which Qing Shui could break as it would require a lot of brute force. Only if he had enough strength, could he forcefully destroyed the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon-capturing Hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui once again unleashed the Dragon-capturing Hands. Following on, he used his Gouging Strike on the Taiyang Acupoint of the Flower Demon who was temporarily stunned by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demon trembled. At the moment when Qing Shui’s Gouging Strike was about to hit her Taiyang Acupoint, she recovered and quickly moved her head backward. However, she still got hit in her shoulder and once again became paralyzed temporarily. At this moment, Qing Shui flicked his finger and a golden light quickly intruded the Flower Demon’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianshen Acupoint!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianshen Acupoint was a lethal point in the brain. As soon as it got penetrated by the Gold Needle, the Flower Demon once again lost her cool. This time, she truly went insane. Furthermore, the Gold Needle contained some of Qing Shui’s Nine Yang Force. Very soon, she would experience brain death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head. He never liked killing a beautiful lass in such a brutal way, but the opponent wanted to kill him, let alone he also didn’t really consider the Flower Demon as a human. She was just a monster that sucked on human’s blood and had no regards to human’s life. A beautiful monster as she was, should indeed be killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, the Flower Demon collapsed onto the ground. The storm of flower around her all started dropping down one by one. When Qing Shui saw that happening, he was stunned. After that, he began to think deeply when he remembered the Resonating Spiral Force between the storms of flowers as well as all the things which the Heavenly Vision Technique had seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lotus flower!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine lotus flowers appeared around Qing Shui. There were nine of them and each of them was gold in color with the size of a washbowl. The thick and dignified golden lotus flowers were about one foot thick and seemed very heavy. At this moment, they were surrounding Qing Shui and revolving constantly. There were each three of them at the top and the bottom. Every three of them formed a triangle and surrounded Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flowers were blown by the wind and ended up around Qing Shui. It settled down right beside one of the Golden Lotus Flower. The next thing that happened, they immediately turned into ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strangling force… The terrifying power generated from constant rotational force both clockwise and anti-clockwise of an object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moving on, Qing Shui began controlling the Lotus Flowers. They were able to fly and some of them were even spinning around the area. In the beginning, one flew out, then two, and finally, three. After that, no more lotuses flew out. By the time Qing Shui came back to his senses, he noticed Shen Huang sitting at the corner hugging her knees. She was shivering, so much that thin ice had begun forming across her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t have the time to celebrate his joyful moment of comprehending his newly acquired techniques. He ran to Shen Huang and embraced her. After that, he quickly activated the Nine Yang Force in his body, he said in anger, “Why didn’t you call out to me? You foolish woman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang bit her lips. By now, she wasn’t even able to speak. She left her eyes half-opened as she laid in Qing Shui’s arms. There was a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She fell asleep after a while. For a moment, Qing Shui didn’t know what to do, seeing the woman sleeping soundly in his arms. Her expression looked relaxed. Her exquisite and fine face, long and thin eyelashes, they were black and curled just like a palm-leaf fan. Her beautiful face was pale and smooth like jade. Her tall nose, as well as her pastel pink lips, made her look very attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had both her arms gently put around Qing Shui; however, this was an unconscious act. After a while, Qing Shui cast his eyes down onto the woman who was still having her eyes closed. He knew that by now, she was already awake. Prior to this, she was exhausted from resisting against the coldness. At the same time, her body was also damaged from it, which was why she fell into a slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stretched his arms out and carried her up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” Shen Huang cried out gently and opened her eyes. She felt very embarrassed as she never expected for herself to sleep in a man’s arms. Furthermore, she was so at peace sleeping in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are awake. In the future, when you ever feel cold again, you must call out to me no matter what I am doing.” Qing Shui said with a strict voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” Shen Huang responded gently. She felt a sense of warmth in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demon was dead, leaving behind an Interspatial Bracelet. It looked beautiful just like a flower. After burning the body of the Flower Demon, Qing Shui took up the beautiful Interspatial Bracelet and saw a lot of random things in it. However, there was a particular object inside the bracelet: a book that resembled a flower. It was shining brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took it out. Usually, the things which shone brightly wouldn’t be anything ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as this thing was taken out, and before Qing Shui could say anything or observe it, it already flew out into Shen Huang’s arms on its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was stunned. While she was still in shock, she was shrouded by a bright and dazzling light. Seeing that, Qing Shui finally understood what was going on. This was a kind of inheritance. Once the previous inheritor died, the thing would automatically become an object without an owner. So long as the time was right, it would recognize its next owner on its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of legacy could only be passed onto a woman. Thus, Qing Shui wouldn’t receive the inheritance even if he had held the Flower Book earlier. Furthermore, it automatically reached out to Shen Huang right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Usually, when a weapon recognized its owner on its own, for example, the phenomenon which was occurring right now, it would mean that the owner which it found was suited for the inheritance. If the compatibility wasn’t high enough, it wouldn’t do so unless the woman found some ways to make it recognize her as its owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Book recognized Shen Huang as its owner on its own. From here, it could be seen how much they were compatible with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After quite a while, the Flower Book turned into an ordinary book. It looked very beautiful, but it lost the light from before. It was going to have to spend quite a while to recover its inheritance energy. But before its current owner died, it wouldn’t recognize any other masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang had also calmed down. Qing Shui stared blankly at the current Shen Huang. She looked even more beautiful than before. The snow-white Luan Phoenix Cloth was decorated with a few unusual and beautiful flowers on its sleeves. Unless one looked at it carefully, they wouldn’t be able to notice its difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like usual, she still looked so pure and holy. Only that now, she has also developed a flower-like temperament. She was radiating with more charm than ever, but at the same time, it also complemented with cold and extraordinary feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the flowers, there were roses, Chinese Rose, Snow Lotus Flower, and even some poisonous flowers. The temperaments of each flower would also be absorbed by the inheritor. So long as they were flowers, they were bound to attract people to them even if they were flowers with thorns like the roses.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now, I have also turned into a Flower Demon myself…”</span></p>

Oh yeah, what kind of legacy is this?” Qing Shui asked, driven by curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Divine Flower Inheritance!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. He initially assumed it to be either the Flower Demon Inheritance or Flower Fairy Inheritance. He never expected for it to be the Divine Flower Inheritance. At this moment, Shen Huang interrupted his thought, “This inheritance seems to be related to the person who inherited it. It can be known as the Flower Demon, Flower Fairy, Flower Spirit, Flower King, Flower Empress and so on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems the Divine Flower Inheritance is the best out of all of them.” Qing Shui just took a wild guess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was a bit embarrassed. “It’s stated here that it’s indeed the best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks even more dazzling than the most beautiful flower,” said Qing Shui while looking at her fervently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you like it?” When Shen Huang heard what Qing Shui said, she actually spun one round on the ground and only after that did she ask Qing Shui the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart started racing, and he could feel his heart beating fast. Never had he ever thought that Shen Huang would act this way. The second she turned around, and the moment her delicate hair swayed around in the wind… Her perfect body figure, as well as her exquisite temperament and her profound eyes, it caused Qing Shui to feel as if his very soul had come out of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that he was being seduced, but yet he was unable to come back to his senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the ability of Divine Flower Inheritance. It was capable of attracting and seducing one’s soul without having to show or reveal any of the user’s charms. Merely a simple movement or even a casual glance would have caused the victim to lose his soul.</span></p>
