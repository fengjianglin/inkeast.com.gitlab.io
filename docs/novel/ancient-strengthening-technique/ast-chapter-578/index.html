 <p><strong>AST 578 - Luan Luan and Yuchang taken away, Four Seas Country vying for the Greencloud Continent (1)</strong></p>
 <p>This was why it was so important to be familiar with your techniques, like the Minute Subtlety or like how the late Old Ancestor and the others could control their strength to within a millimeter of what they wanted. That way of attacking would not waste any energy. it would conserve the stamina in battle, thus raising the ability to survive,</p>
 <p>In this period of time, Qing Shui’s Heavenly Talisman had not reached the fourth grade. He had not learned new types of Heavenly Talisman and he only continued to practice the ones he knew already.</p>
 <p>Ever since people started to be able to dispel the Heavenly Talismans, Qing Shui went and conducted an in depth investigation of the information regarding the Heavenly Talisman, he even went to Lin Zhanhan for advice. The reason he seeked information was because his strength and experience were still too shallow. It was said that when one reached the peak divine talisman, their Heavenly Talismans could affect the target until they died.</p>
 <p>Thus, in this period of time, Qing Shui focused on drawing Talismans and paintings. With his explosive increase in strength, the might of his Heavenly Talismans had increased by several folds. Just one of his talismans could now cause a peak Martial King to turn into trash.</p>
 <p>Now, aside from drawing talismans, he also painted the Hundred Forms of the Tiger, starting from the first one, The Walking Tiger!</p>
 <p>In his past life, the tiger was crowned the king of the beasts. In the World of the Nine Continents, there was no such term, but the tiger did not lose the might that it had, it had even became stronger.</p>
 <p>Dragon Walking Tiger Pacing!</p>
 <p>Thus, Qing Shui felt that the tiger pacing about in this painting had an indescribable might. The dragon followed the clouds and the tiger followed the wind, Qing Shui stared at the pacing tiger without blinking.</p>
 <p>Each step taken was not simple, through this painting, Qing Shui could sense the tiger breathing and the movement of its muscles. Every one of its steps involved the movement of its whole body.</p>
 <p>Following that, Qing Shui looked at the next two paintings. Like this, two days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal passed as he stared at the paintings. Finally, he picked up the brush. Qing Shui searched for a composed feeling.</p>
 <p>His whole body relaxed, when painting, Qing Shui would not intentionally use the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Now, he was drawing for drawing’s sake. Thus, he threw everything else to the back of his mind.</p>
 <p>It was tedious but he enjoyed it!</p>
 <p>In order to accomplish great things, one must persevere and be able to endure loneliness!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not lack these two things, what he lacked was a crucial moment. However, Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, thus this crucial moment would come eventually! After practicing for a bit, he then frantically refined some medicinal pills.</p>
 <p>He needed a lot of medicinal pills like the Spirit Concentrating Pill. Furthermore, he would still be using the pills in the future, he would not make a loss if he saved up some up, it was a reliable method.</p>
 <p>The Threefold Spirit Concentrating Pill allowed one’s cultivation speed to increase by three times. Although it was not as good as the Sixfold Spirit Concentrating Pill, the number of people who could use them continuously were already few in number.</p>
 <p>While he rushed to the Greencloud Continent, he unrelentingly refined them. However, he would still require about four months of time to enough experience to unlock the recipe for the Aroma Concentration Pill, his child would be born around that time.</p>
 <p>For the sake of drawing, Qing Shui even sought the advice of several artists, coupled with Qing Shui’s background in drawing talismans, he was at least at the level of introduction, at best, he was barely at the level of level of drawing skin.</p>
 <p>The level of drawing skin was a very important stage, it could be compared to the foundations of a building. If the basics of ‘drawing skin’ were not up to standard, then there was no need to even think of progressing further, it would also be impossible to feel it.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still joined in with the other members of the Qing Clan for morning practice, he also guided their cultivation. The one that improved the fastest in the Qing Clan was Luan Luan, aside from her, Yiye Jiange, Mingyue Gelou, and Wenren Wu-shuang were all especially fast as well.</p>
 <p>Because of her pregnancy, Canghai Mingyue placed her cultivation on hold.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange and Wenren Wu-shuang had abundant spirit and jade bones, as women from the Portraits of Beauty, their fast improvement speeds were not surprising. With Luan Luan’s Heart of Seven Orifices, her godlike speed in cultivation was also normal.</p>
 <p>Now that Qing Shui was at home again, there was once again a continuous flow of medicinal pills and well as soups that nourished the body and bones. Occasionally, Qing Shui would use the Gold Needles to help them strengthen their roots and cultivate their essence, activating the potential of their bodies.</p>
 <p>Maybe it was because Qing Shui was back, aside from cultivation and managing the shop, the other people seemed quite free. With Qing Shui around, they could shorten their cultivating time and still have a greater effect.</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan, how is that Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear of yours?” Qing Shui suddenly remembered that strong ‘little bear’. He did not know if it had grown bigger, or more importantly, stronger.</p>
 <p>“That fellow can eat a lot, it is much bigger now.”</p>
 <p>Luan Luan happily summoned out the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. It was grown by about one meter compared to the time it had just eaten the Beast Pill. Now, it looked even more tall and sturdy, the fiery-red scale armor looked especially mighty.</p>
 <p>“It already has the strength of three countries and the defense of seven countries, it is a pity that its attack is a little weak, or else it would be a very strong Demonic Beast.” Qing Shui happily thought, its defense was still relatively outstanding.</p>
 <p>The most important thing was that the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear had great potential, it grew fast and had a very high upper limit, its future could not be measured.</p>
 <p>After he saw the fire attributed Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear, Qing Shui thought for a period of time. He realized that he could feed the Five Elements Fruit to Demonic Beasts. This thing was valuable beyond compare, it definitely could benefit the Demonic Beasts, increasing their potentials greatly.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Time flew by, in a flash, Qing Shui had already been back in the Qing Clan for a month already. Both the Heavenly Palace and the Qing Clan were peaceful, nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>This was a good life, Qing Shui was happy with this, this was what life should be like, it was also what he looked forward to. During this one month period, his mentality had changed slightly.</p>
 <p>Although he had not reached a state of complete relaxation, he was already halfway there. Qing Shui could felt that it had something to do with the breakthrough of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and in the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, as well as his increase in strength.</p>
 <p>Only with absolute strength would one be able to relax!</p>
 <p>Regardless of all those factors, Qing Shui considerably enjoyed his life now as he tried to completely relax. If he could breakthrough to the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, then he would be able to fulfill all his dreams and duties.</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan and Yuchang were taken away by the people of the Four Seas Country, they said that Luan Luan’s Demonic Beast killed their people. They said to send people to the ‘Hundred Clan War Barracks’ to retrieve Luan Luan and Yuchang.” Yiye Jiange came looking for Qing Shui frowning as she said anxiously.</p>
 <p>“Don’t panic, what happened?” Qing Shui eyes slowly squinted.</p>
 <p>“Today, Luan Luan and Yuchang went out to play, just like usual. Awhile ago, a person came here and gave a note to me, take a look.” Yiye Jiange hurriedly handed a note in her hands to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly received the note then opened and looked at it.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, your two daughters are naughty, mischievous and unteachable, they used their Demonic Beast to injure my people, they are arrogant, conceited and condescending. Since your Qing Clan can’t be bothered to manage them, I don’t mind teaching them on your behalf. The Four Seas Country may just be a country, but no one can simply bully us. We are not afraid even if your Qing Clan was able to destroy the Sword Tower and Demonic Beast Sect. If you do not come to the Hundred Clan War Barracks in three days, suffer the consequences yourself.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the Hundred Clan War Barracks signed off at the bottom!</p>
 <p>“I’ll go take a look, wait at home for my news!” Qing Shui smiled at Yiye Jiange. This matter should not be delayed!</p>
 <p>“I will go with you!” Yiye Jiange said resolutely.</p>
 <p>“Sure, wait for a moment, I will go and inform the Clan.”</p>
 <p>When he arrived at the backyard, he saw Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan drinking tea and playing chess. In the World of the Nine Continents, playing chess was a normal affair, there were no lack of people who played.</p>
 <p>After seeing Qing Shui, Lin Zhanhan placed down the chess piece in his hands: “Is something wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Not really, I’m just here to ask something, I wonder if grandpa Lin knows anything about the Four Seas Country?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Lin Zhanhan whole body trembled then looked at Qing Shui: “Qing Shui, just say it, what is the situation, we will help you think of ideas.”</p>
 <p>Looking at Lin Zhanhan’s reaction, Qing Shui felt that it was a little strange. However, when he thought about the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and his strength, there should not be anyone who could defeat them in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly handed the note over!</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it is the Hundred Clan War Barracks.” Lin Zhanhan sighed after looking at the note and handed it back to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Four Seas Country was a country on the west side of the Greencloud Continent. Its distance from the Continent's Capital was not far and would only take two or three days on a flying beast. Without revealing everything, their strength already ranked among the top ten in the 81 countries of Greencloud Continent. However, they had never made any big moves.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the Greencloud Continent is not as weak as it seems on the surface. When I was in the Northern Sacred Lu Continent, I heard about some news about the Greencloud Continent. Part of this news involves the Hundred Clan War Barracks of the Four Seas Country.”</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Lin is saying that there are Martial Saints in the Greencloud Continent?” Qing Shui looked at Lin Zhanhan in surprise.</p>
 <p>“In the World of the Nine Continents, the Greencloud Continent is also one of the continents. However, in the other eight continents, Martial Saints are in abundance. Do you truly believe that the Greencloud Continent has no Martial Saints at all? Since the other continents have Martial Saints, then we should have some as well. You have to know that in the other Continents, Martial Saints can also be forced into a corner, being unable survive there.” Lin Zhanhan looked at Qing Shui and said seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the note again, the party was aware of his status of the Heavenly Palace Patriarch, and that he had killed a Martial Saint. In the note, when they mentioned that he had destroyed the Sword Tower and Demonic Beast Sect, yet their tone was full of disdain. It seemed like they thought they could do have done it as well. Qing Shui felt that the situation was not as simple as he had thought and started to get a little worried.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the main clan of the Hundred Clan War Barracks are not people from the Greencloud Continent. When I have heard of the Hundred Clan War Barracks two hundred years ago, their main clan already had Martial Saints. Rumors have it that they were forced into a precarious situation, thus they sneakily came to the Four Seas Country. They then gathered a hundred of the clans of the Four Seas Country to form the Hundred Clan War Barracks. Maybe it is because the main clan was from another continent, they always stayed at the Four Seas Country and did not have any major movements in the Greencloud Continent.”</p>
 <p>“Then why are they now taking action against our Qing Clan, I absolutely feel that Luan Luan would not cause a scene without any reason. I understand that young lass very well, the other party is definitely intentionally finding trouble.”</p>
 <p>“The Qing Clan is now a big clan of the Greencloud Continent, and you are indisputably the strongest person in the Greencloud Continent. They should be trying to find their footing in the Greencloud Continent, thus the best person for them to become a stepping stone is you.” Lin Zhanhan frowned.</p>
 <p>“En, alright, I’ll go check on the two young lasses, so that they don’t get too frightened. Or else, even killing all of them would not be sufficient.” Qing Shui smiled and got up to leave.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you are going just like that?” Qing Luo hurriedly held Qing Shui back.</p>
 <p>“Grandfather, I need to go. You can relax, nothing bad will happen.” Qing Shui consoled Qing Luo. Qing Shui hoped the Martial Saint in the Hundred Clan War Barracks did not was not stronger than a Grade Two Martial Saint, or else the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would not be able to do anything.</p>
 <p>It was a good thing that between the grades of Martial Saint, the distance was quite huge. Elder Ge was a Grade One Martial Saint with the strength of 30 countries, but a Martial Saint with the strength of 200 countries was also a Grade One Martial Saint. Thus, Qing Shui carried some hope.</p>
 <p>The Martial Saint of a clan that was chased out should not have a strength more than the 400 countries, or else they would not have been chased out of their continent. In the World of the Nine Continents, a Martial Saint would be the local warlord anyway they go.</p>
 <p>“Brother Luo, let Qing Shui go, the strongest person in the Hundred Clan War Barracks would only approximately have the strength of 200 countries. However, remember to be careful.” Lin Zhanhan told Qing Luo, then reminded Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Lin Zhanhan knew that with Qing Shui’s character, he would definitely go, regardless of the situation. Qing Luo sighed and released Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Grandfather, Grandpa Lin, nothing will happen to me, you’ll see!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and got it to Skywalk. Qing Shui could not bear to see the two old men worrying about him so deeply. Anyways, he did not have to keep any secrets from them and this way they would be more at ease.</p>
 <p>Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan were stunned. They stared blankly at Qing Shui for awhile. Qing Luo laughed in a forthright manner: “Alright, go on, go.”</p>
 <p>Lin Zhanhan also laughed happily, he had watched Qing Shui grow up, he knew that Qing Shui would not do anything that he was not confident in. When he had seen the Diamond Demonic Boar back then, he could tell that it was a mutated beast, but he never thought that it would be able to grow so fast.</p>
 <p>“He said that he wanted to fulfill his own dreams, it looks like it is going to be possible for him to do so.” Lin Zhanhan thought joyfully.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange rode on the Fire Bird and flew to the Four Seas Country. Yiye Jiange was so anxious that her face went pale. She kept on looking at Qing Shui uneasily.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so anxious, there won’t be any problems. Luan Luan will be fine. As long as I’m around, I will not let anybody bully her.” Qing Shui gently tugged at her sleeves.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange frowned even more!</p>
 <p>“The matters of my Yiye Clan has caused you to go onto this dangerous path, I feel very uneasy.” Yiye Jiange sighed indistinctly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t say that, Luan Luan is also my daughter. Should I not do this?” Qing Shui knew that she was worried about him, and did not want him to be in danger.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, this note has made clear one problem, if the words of the Hundred Clan War Barracks were not foolish words, then they have the capability to easily destroy the people of Sword Tower and Demonic Beast Sect. Their capabilities might not even be limited to that.</p>
 <p>What a calm and intelligent woman, while the problem may sound simple, but Luan Luan was her only relative, it would be difficult for her to remain calm and analyse the situation as he did. At this moment, the fact that she could calmly think about this proved she had a strong mentality.</p>
 <p>“So what? It does not matter who is it. I don’t even care who was in the right or who was in the wrong, no one can touch the people around me.” Qing Shui said it very casually but he was actually very determined.</p>
 <p>A faint warm feeling filled Yiye Jiange’s heart. She felt very happy. Luan Luan was found by Qing Shui and her longevity was also lengthened by Qing Shui. Having a resolute man standing by her side at this moment was a happy matter…...</p>
