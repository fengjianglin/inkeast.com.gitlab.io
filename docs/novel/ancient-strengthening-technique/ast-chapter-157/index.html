  <p><strong>AST 0157 – Tiger Form Coming to Life!!</strong></p>
  <p>Time slowly passed by as the carriage pulled by metallic bull beasts progressed in a sluggish pace. It was not considered very slow because they would be travelling on a very long journey. Faced with such a situation, Qing Shui yearned even more for a flying demonic beast ride.</p>
  <p>They were passing by crowded marketplaces filled with people and carts, and hilly wilderness. They would occasionally hear terrifying roars of beasts or see strong demonic beasts flying around!</p>
  <p>“Let’s rest here for the night. The metallic bull beasts are tired as well,” the stronger coachman told Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>“Alright!” Qing Shui grinned and replied, but contempt filled his eyes.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui turned back to look at Wenren Wu-Shuang and noticed that her cheeks were dyed red. She must have also heard the “hidden motives” of the two coachmen!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had initially thought that these two coachmen were strong and sturdy. Furthermore, they seemed to remain unaffected when they saw Wu-Shuang. Thus, he decided to recruit them for the journey to Cang Lang Country!</p>
  <p>It was just that he had not expected these two men to hide it so well. Qing Shui had not thought that they would think of tainting Wu-Shuang. Seeing that Wu-Shuang had the beauty compared to a goddess, they started to harbor evil thoughts and prepared to kill the guy that night and bring the lady back to be their wife!</p>
  <p>If it weren’t for the fact that they had travelled close to one-third of the journey and didn’t know the path to Skysword Sect, Qing Shui would have taken down the two scums immediately. The two strong men seemed to have achieved quite a high level of cultivation as they emitted a dauntless aura. They must have tainted quite a number of women!</p>
  <p>It was freezing cold and they were in the wilderness as the four of them gathered around the campfire to eat their rations. The sight of Wenren Wu-Shuang by the campfire was so beautiful that it was stifling. The pretty face that was slightly smoked red made the guys who saw it rage with a beastly impulse.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui remained smiling quietly as he kept the fire going. Even without seeing them, he could feel the slightly reddish gaze of the two men that were openly staring at Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not give a hoot about these two small fries. It was as if he was enjoying a clown’s performance and he could not help but looked towards Wu-Shuang. Their gazes clashed by coincidence. At that moment, Qing Shui felt that their interaction was very mysterious, as if they could tell what the other was thinking at that moment.</p>
  <p>At that moment, the stronger man besides Qing Shui suddenly stood up. He agilely whipped out a bright, short blade from his waist and skillfully thrusted towards the back of Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
  <p>“You’re courting death!”</p>
  <p>Without even a glance, Qing Shui directly grabbed onto the handle of the dagger! </p>
  <p>The sounds of bones cracking echoed, making one’s scalp tingle.</p>
  <p>“Ahh!!!”</p>
  <p>The man’s shrill screams could only mean that one of his hands was crushed by Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>The other man who had yet to make a move stayed where he was, dazed. To think that the seemingly “frail and delicate” young master from a rich family was able to maim Luo Qiang who was at the 7th grade of the Martial Warrior.</p>
  <p>“Ahh! I’ve done wrong. Young Master, please spare my life. I didn’t know any better and must have been blind to set you as my target!” With his hand maimed, the man sweated profusely as he kept on begging for forgiveness. He could already sense the potent killing intent within Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
  <p>“You’re in the wrong? Hahaha!” Qing Shui laughed out in fury!</p>
  <p>“If I did not have the skills to defend myself, wouldn’t I have died without even knowing what happened?” Qing Shui was filled with an immense fury.</p>
  <p>Things turned out fine since it was him, but if it was some other ordinary folks, they would have suffered horribly. The more he thought about it, the more infuriated he was. Wu-Shuang also felt scared after hearing what Qing Shui had said. While she did not feel scared earlier because she was highly skilled, she could not bear to think about what would have happened if that wasn’t the case.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rapidly landed a few kicks on the man’s Dantian as well as on a few acupoints on the lower body. He did the same to the other guy. This not only crippled them of their cultivation but also to caused them to be impotent.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not kill him primarily for the reason that they can still be the coachmen. The world of the nine continents revered those with power; the weak fall prey to the strong. Moreover, he had let them suffer a fate worse than death!</p>
  <p>It was a peaceful night, but only a few suppressed cries of pain echoed as their cultivation was crippled. Being in the wilderness with Qing Shui and Wu-Shuang on the carriage, they would not be able to escape even if they wished to do so. More so, they did not dare to attempt to escape.</p>
  <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui went about with his training as usual. He trained only the Deer Cantering and Tiger Form for the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui kept his fist half-clenched. Each time he struck, there was a deep deafening sound of a tiger’s roar.</p>
  <p>When the Tiger’s Mount struck, there were echoes of tiger roars that would cause one’s heart to tremble. At that moment, Qing Shui was like a tall giant with a heightened aura. He accumulated Qi and pushed his aura to its peak.</p>
  <p>Thereafter, it was the Tiger’s Descend. With his two hands clasped together, this was able to pressurize the opponent. It released an overwhelming and destructive aura and had the greatest prowess.</p>
  <p>There was an unparalleled sharpness to his figure and the Qi previously accumulated was like a vast ocean. The overwhelming seawater seemed to have found a gap to escape as they surged out violently. They seemed to be able to destroy and even overthrow a large mountain!</p>
  <p>Hooking, Hanging, Pointing, Carrying, Piercing, Slicing, Hacking</p>
  <p>After, Qing Shui practiced the Solitary Rapid Fist and the Free Spirit Steps. He also dealt with concealed weapons, sword piercing, sword pointing, and sword hacking one by one. He eventually tried to incorporate the Deer Cantering into the Free Spirit Steps. What Qing Shui was aiming for was a higher level of incorporation. This would make it so that the Free Spirit Steps and the Deer Cantering would reach the stage where they had become one. But Qing Shui understood that he would still need more time to achieve this.</p>
  <p>The Tiger Form. Qing Shui had been devoting his time on the Tiger Form. The Tiger Form has many offensive techniques. Other than the four powerful killer moves, there was still the Tiger Laceration, the Tiger Claw Attack, and the Tiger Lunge…</p>
  <p>The Tiger Form emphasized on offensive traits coupled with incisiveness. What Qing Shui lacked were offensive techniques. He had primarily picked up supporting techniques in the past. All this time, from the killing of Xiantian experts to the Golden-Ringed Snake King, he had relied on his terrifying brute strength and the amazing effects of the primordial flames.<br></p>
  <p>Qing Shui repeatedly practiced the Tiger Form. Gradually with the tiger roars, Qing Shui seemed to have turned into a gigantic tiger himself. He slowly incorporated techniques of the Solitary Rapid Fist into the Tiger Form.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>There is only one move, or even to say, one trick to the Solitary Rapid Fist. It changes according to the moves made by the opponent. The Tiger Form focuses on incisive offenses, and with the incorporation of the Rapid Solitary Fist, its prowess was increased by leaps and bounds. Qing Shui clearly felt the differences, as if a tiger’s intelligence had been replaced with that of a human’s. Thus, the combined individual would have greater intelligence.</p>
  <p>Intelligence was originally the unique trait of the Rapid Solitary Fist. The effects from the combination of moves with the Tiger Form and the Rapid Solitary Fist made Qing Shui give a loud and long roar!</p>
  <p>“The Tiger Form is coming to life!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui even felt that his present self or future self could take on other martial techniques. There were those that could serve as a complement to achieve an extremely powerful effect. This was the real charm of supporting techniques.</p>
  <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique broke through to 63 cycles just as he had hoped it to be. While he was happy, Qing Shui knew that the next hurdle would be even higher! </p>
  <p>When Qing Shui woke up the next morning, the metallic bull beasts were already on the way. Qing Shui came out from his room and noticed that Wu-Shuang was already awake and standing next to windows. She looked towards the mountains in the far distance.</p>
  <p>When she saw Qing Shui, she broke into a smile that would mesmerize all living things!</p>
  <p>Poise and purity has only a thin line that differed from seductive charms. And most importantly, the two were interchangeable. Some people liked women who were poised and pure, while some preferred seductive and lewd women, and even more those who were unpredictable.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at Wu-Shuang and smiled as he looked at her beautiful and unparalleled makeup-free face. He stared at her wonderful back view, and that extremely charming presence. But Qing Shui would always recall the scene when she was taking a bath. Her figure with her tempting butt perked up could cause one’s imagination to run wild.</p>

 <p>Intelligence was originally the unique trait of the Rapid Solitary Fist. The effects from the combination of moves with the Tiger Form and the Rapid Solitary Fist made Qing Shui give a loud and long roar!</p>
 <p>“The Tiger Form is coming to life!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui even felt that his present self or future self could take on other martial techniques. There were those that could serve as a complement to achieve an extremely powerful effect. This was the real charm of supporting techniques.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique broke through to 63 cycles just as he had hoped it to be. While he was happy, Qing Shui knew that the next hurdle would be even higher! </p>
 <p>When Qing Shui woke up the next morning, the metallic bull beasts were already on the way. Qing Shui came out from his room and noticed that Wu-Shuang was already awake and standing next to windows. She looked towards the mountains in the far distance.</p>
 <p>When she saw Qing Shui, she broke into a smile that would mesmerize all living things!</p>
 <p>Poise and purity has only a thin line that differed from seductive charms. And most importantly, the two were interchangeable. Some people liked women who were poised and pure, while some preferred seductive and lewd women, and even more those who were unpredictable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Wu-Shuang and smiled as he looked at her beautiful and unparalleled makeup-free face. He stared at her wonderful back view, and that extremely charming presence. But Qing Shui would always recall the scene when she was taking a bath. Her figure with her tempting butt perked up could cause one’s imagination to run wild.</p>
