 <p><strong>AST 1388 - Blood River Chariot Formation, Che Qi’s Sure Kill Heavenly Technique, Blood Saber Death Seal</strong></p>
 <p>Hearing the Divine Sound Sect being mentioned, Qing Shui did not say much. He had never heard of the Divine Sound Sect but it seemed rather formidable. He decided he would remain silent. If the Che Clan was wary about the Divine Sound Sect, then Qing Shui’s silence would cause them unnecessary worry.</p>
 <p>“The Divine Sound Sect and I have no relation. You can be reassured that they would not interfere because there will be no need for it.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>His way of speaking caused further uncertainty within the hearts of the members of the Che Clan. It was already past the point of no return. The elder’s face paled as he looked at Qing Shui, “The Divine Sound Sect is a sinister and evil force, to join forces with a sinister power, the Dancing Phoenix Continent would not allow the likes of you to go about unscathed.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained calm and collected, he had already guessed as much. Previously, he had heard of the Four Great Evil Powers. Demon Lord Palace was one of the four, it would seem that Divine Sound Sect was amongst their ranks as well. However, Qing Shui did not know the remaining two.</p>
 <p>“Those who walk straight would not be worried about their shadows being slanted. However, there are people who could be under the light of the sun but could have an evil heart,” Qing Shui said with the least bit of concern.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of what your relationship with the Divine Sound Sect is, you killed someone within the Che Clan, now you will be buried with them.” The elder’s voice was loud. The elder belonged to the Phoenix Dance Organization. If the Divine Sound Sect was to intervene, then the Phoenix Dance Organization would not stay idle. The Phoenix Dance Organization and the Four Great Evil Powers were in opposition to each other.</p>
 <p>“If that is the case, then we should just talk about our abilities. Will all of you come at me all at once or will it just be you?” Qing Shui provoked him again.</p>
 <p>The simplest provocation was usually the most effective. Right now, the surroundings were filled with members of the Che Clan. It would be easily misunderstood as if they were bullying the weak with their numbers.</p>
 <p>“Do you have time to care if we were all attacking at once? You can come at us with your full force too. Do you know how pitiful you are? Just like a fool rushing to challenge an entire clan, then asking for one on one fights. Who do you think you are? Do you think after saying a few words things will go as you wish? I am a busy man, I do not have time to play with you. My only goal is to take your life to account for the lives of the Che Clan that you have taken.” The elder looked at Qing Shui and said with disdain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared back blankly, to think this old man was so thick-skinned. Qing Shui laughed, “You know no shame. To say those words without any strength to back it up. Alright, then come at me all at once. I will not look down on you guys. If you all come at me and die together, your ancestors on the other side won’t recognize you as their clansmen.”</p>
 <p>“Boy, to be so cheeky at death’s door. Attack, Blood River Chariot Formation!”</p>
 <p>The elder waved his hand after yelling those words. Everyone pulled out a blood red long sabre. They were grouped together in a strange formation, as if it was a giant blood chariot, releasing an intense killing intent. The elder, with a blood sabre in hand, stood on top of the chariot, as if he was the driver.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu would soon come out, Qing Shui slightly raised his hand. This formation was different from the formations he had encountered before; it had no aura. The formations before that were all enveloped in an aura were all considered small formations. Their weakness was in the consumption level, the bigger it was the higher the consumption. Most could not last more than fifteen minutes. However, the Blood River Chariot Formation in front of Qing Shui was different.</p>
 <p>This formation was like the ones used by Qing Shui. It chained together all the Origin Qi, using the elder as the eye of the formation. In battle, the elder was the only one who would attack, the others would not show their hand. This way, the elder’s strength could be fully utilized. The elder’s strength would be more formidable, regardless of it being his attack, defense or speed…</p>
 <p>“This is our Che Clan’s inherited battle formation, Blood River Chariot Formation. We will put you in your place, with your lack of outlook and experience. Your sole efforts are nothing more than a fool’s bravery. Of course, what you have shown can’t even be considered bravery.” Che Qi looked at Qing Shui and slowly raised his blood saber.</p>
 <p>The elder’s name was Che Qi, his position within the Che Clan was not low. These people were all his strongest partners, Blood River Chariot Formation had enabled him to kill many formidable martial artists.</p>
 <p>“Then I will show you what a simple man’s bravery is. A real man’s bravery can surpass the strength of a battalion of 100,000,” Qing Shui said after seeing the opposition’s formation and letting out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“Make your move, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance.” Che Qi’s killing intent was slowly spreading to the surroundings.</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds Worshipping the Phoenix!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui naturally was not going to waste anytime shredding their power with a potent debuff, then transitioning with steps.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Positions!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Laws!</p>
 <p>Five Elements Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s silhouette moved, after such a long time, the stone that acted as the eye of the formation had no fluctuations. However, the power increase was doubled for formations and Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>The least of his worries was a position type formation. Since Qing Shui knew that there were not many that could exceed his knowledge in positioning, especially when it came to formations that required many people to cast. Even if it was powerful in strength, it was still intertwined with both strong and weak members. Therefore, Qing Shui can cast Formation Intercept to break their formation.</p>
 <p>Formation Intercept!</p>
 <p>This ability extends from formation techniques. Once a formation was intercepted, its power is reduced. This is exactly why Qing Shui wanted to intercept the formation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s speed was fast or it could be described as smoothly drifting and changing unpredictably. His silhouette would flash by and appear on the left, his fist would strike the head of the opponent.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Another loud pitched noise resounded. Qing Shui’s fist struck his opponent leaving behind a wavy mark on the head of his victims. Suddenly, a giant sabre Qi like that of the speed of lightning slashed towards Qing Shui, carrying an intense killing intent.</p>
 <p>The debuff from before had already shocked Che Qi. 30% strength was still frightening, it left him feeling that Qing Shui was evil. Even with his weakened strength, it was not something that Qing Shui could easily resist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly retreated using Five Elements Steps.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the entire formation fiercely advanced forward with Qing Shui’s retreat. Compared to Qing Shui’s speed, the formation’s advancement was not slow by any means. An overwhelming Bloodwave Qi rushed towards Qing Shui, at that moment even Qing Shui felt like he was being smothered. This was not a feeling related to breathing or not.</p>
 <p>Blood Saber Death Seal!</p>
 <p>The elder slashed with the saber in his hand again. His blood saber transformed into a vibrant color, a grey cloud-like entity appeared in the surrounding, as if it was engulfed in the air. It was too sudden that he had not seen it before but now he could clearly sense it.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A dull noise resounded as Qing Shui was sent flying. The moment Qing Shui’s body was struck by the Blood Saber, a golden aura blocked the sharp attack.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised but he immediately understood that the Paragon Golden Armor had the effect to withstand one fatal attack.</p>
 <p>Che Qi was more astonished than Qing Shui because the Blood Saber Death Seal was Che Qi’s number one Sure Kill Heavenly Technique. It was a certain killing blow, even if the opposition was to avoid the attack, the Blood River Chariot Formation could continually advance until the Blood Saber Death Seal hit the target. During this time, the target was locked on, there was no escape. There were exceptions but Che Qi had never known of an exception.</p>
 <p>Blood Saber Death Seal could double the strength of this certain killing blow but this slash had not killed the young man.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned, he had thought of using Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring to dodge but it had malfunctioned…</p>
 <p>Moreover, Paragon Golden Armor’s effect had already appeared, thus implying that slash was enough to threaten his life. Suddenly, Qing Shui thought of Heavenly Techniques.</p>
 <p>Only a Heavenly Technique could do that, otherwise, his Paragon Golden Armor’s protection would not activate. Without a doubt, he was using a Heavenly Technique and it could only be used once.</p>
 <p>Che Qi had thought of taking the young man’s life under his saber, even using his Sure Kill Technique. However, he had not thought that it would be ineffective.</p>
 <p>At this moment Qing Shui did not move and Che Qi did not advance. The stare down continued for a moment as both found their answer.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made his move, this time directly towards Che Qi.</p>
 <p>Seal of Roc!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used Seal of Roc in midair. Seal of Roc was a spiritual sense lock on but it was not an absolute lock on.</p>
 <p>Che Qi laughed as he saw Qing Shui attack. It was especially frightening to have a smile on the Che Qi’s face that looked like death. He slashed with the blood saber, the sabre Qi that was red like a fiery blaze spun in the air like a giant sabre and dissipated the Seal of Roc. The red sabre Qi continued to rush towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s silhouette disappeared into the distance, then suddenly he appeared at the tail end of the Blood River Chariot Formation.</p>
 <p>Knowing Qing Shui was about to attack, Che Qi was more relaxed, “Even if I don’t move you would not be able to do anything, you attack cannot break the defence of my formation.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed, he raised his hand to form complicated seals. Finger Seal!</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger Acupoint Strike!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hand was fast, after one low pitched noise resounded he raised his other hand to strike with a hand seal.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s movement was fast. Three strikes happened within the time of taking a breath. The time to take a breath was not long but Qing Shui’s level by a martial artist’s standard was considered slow.</p>
 <p>Had the opposition stopped him, Qing Shui would have only struck once and retreated, then he would find an opportunity to strike the same location on the next attack.</p>
 <p>One clear cracking noise resounded. The old man that was struck by Qing Shui dropped like a rock!</p>
 <p>Dead!</p>
 <p>Continuing, Qing Shui’s silhouette moved on to attack the next target.</p>
 <p>Che Qi’s face changed immediately, in a flash, he tried to slash Qing Shui once again.</p>
 <p>Blood Saber Soul Reap!</p>
 <p>Che Qi utilized the Sure Kill Heavenly Technique. Though he had formidable battle techniques, he could only utilize the Sure Kill Heavenly Technique once, so he cannot be over-reliant on it.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the mountain with his consciousness. The Nine Continents Mountain came at a crashing speed!</p>
 <p>Since the Nine Continents Mountain’s power did not threaten Che Qi, its shielding force could be used for blocking.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>Che Qi hollered in a loud voice and heavily slashed toward the Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain was deflected without receiving any damage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took the opportunity and controlled the Nine Continents Mountain to crash towards the centre of the Blood River Chariot Formation.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>With Che Qi’s powerful strike, adding in Qing Shui’s opportunistic guidance, given Qing Shui’s perfect positioning, it was a perfect chance to direct all that energy into the Blood River Chariot Formation. Had Qing Shui guided the mountain in the opposite direction from Che Qi’s strike, he would not have been able to control the Nine Continents Mountain. However, this was the perfect opportunity, he could even add a bit of his own force.</p>
 <p>Immediately, several elders within the Blood River Chariot Formation was sent flying out of the formation as they spewed blood. Even with the formidable defense of the formation, there were heavy casualties.</p>
 <p>They were the weakest amongst those in the formation, even in formation technique they were relatively weak.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Che Qi wanted to vomit blood. His anger shot up his head. Did he not just shoot himself in his foot?</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui did not forget to cast Phoenix Finger to attack the acupuncture point he had struck before. He had tried to protect the acupuncture points that had been struck but Qing Shui attacked his other acupuncture point. However, this time it took five finger strikes before he could take care of that person.</p>
