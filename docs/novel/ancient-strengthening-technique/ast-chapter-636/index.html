 <p><strong>AST 636 - A Chant-like Cry, The Eve of the War</strong></p>
 <p>The Nine Continent Boots could be used once every 24 hours, which was why they had to ride the Fire Bird to Seven Stars Country. Moreover, the Nine Continent Boots could only withstand the weight of a maximum of three people, which would require all three people to hug each other as tightly as possible.</p>
 <p>“Grandma, don't worry.” Qing Shui tried to reassure the old woman after seeing the grave look on her face. After all, the opponent they would be facing had a Red Jiao. The old woman still has a grandson to go home to and he was the only family she had left. Even so, she wasn't able to take care of her grandson alone and needed her neighbors’ assistance.</p>
 <p>“I'm not worried. I'm just afraid that I would not be able to completely settle your problem. If only this happened fifty years ago…..” The old woman sighed again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't pry any further about her past, but he was able to guess that her power was far stronger fifty years ago compared to her current strength. He knew it would only add to her troubles if he tried to ask more about what happened fifty years ago.</p>
 <p>“With your current power, that will be sufficient. Grandma, shall I prove it to you?” Qing Shui said after pondering for a few moments.</p>
 <p>“How can you prove it? The strength of a Grade Eight Martial Saint Red Jiao should be around 5000 countries, or perhaps even more than that. You have to make up for the strength of 1000 more countries to be able to defeat this Demonic Beast. Kid, you must prepare yourself mentally for whatever happens. I will find a way to drag the Red Jiao to the depths of hell.” The old woman was determined to kill the Red Jiao at any cost.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw her determination, he had panicked for a while, yet he felt grateful towards her kindness. Qing Shui had a hunch that she might have a trump card up in her sleeves, but it would cost her a lot to use it in a dire situation.</p>
 <p>“Grandma, still, let me prove it to you!”</p>
 <p>Shortly after he finished talking, Qing Shui locked the Emperor’s Qi onto the old woman and instantaneously decreased her strength by 800 countries, which left her with an overall strength of 4100 countries.</p>
 <p>She dropped down from being a Grade Nine Martial Saint to a Grade Eight Martial Saint in an instant, which had stunned the old woman as she looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. This was the most outrageous weakening ability she had ever seen….</p>
 <p>“Grandma, you should trust me on this!” Qing Shui didn’t want anything to happen to the old woman, so he had directly shown her the power of the Emperor’s Qi to prove and ensure the old woman that everything would turn out alright.</p>
 <p>“Kid, you are extremely peculiar. There are a lot of powerful people who would like to be friends with you if they see this ungodly like skill of yours.” The old woman had finally eased up her expression and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Grandma, you still have a little grandson to take care of. I will provide assistance to you, so be assured and use your power as you normally would.” Qing Shui reassured the old woman one more time.</p>
 <p>“Kid, you are so kind. Good things will come to those that are good-hearted.” The old woman gazed at Qing Shui with a satisfied expression as she laughed out heartily.</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>“Madam, Old Demon Ba is currently on his way to the Seven Stars Country.”</p>
 <p>In the Duanmu Residence of Duanmu City, a middle-aged man stood near the door to Yu Ruyan’s room and had reported in a soft tone.</p>
 <p>“Understood. You may leave!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, madam!”</p>
 <p>“Mother, are you sure you want to go? If you do, I will go too . Can we defeat this old man by ourselves?” Duanmu Lingshuang looked at Yu Ruyan with worried eyes.</p>
 <p>“If someone helped you in the past, you should return the favor with all your abilities. Moreover, we are indebted to Qing Shui for what he did. I just never thought that the old demon would actually break through from a Grade Eight Martial Saint to a Grade Nine Martial Saint during these couple of years. Even his Red Jiao has advanced to Grade Eight Martial Saint as well…..”</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu was only a Grade Eight Peak Martial Saint with the strength of 3900 countries. She used to be on par with Old Demon Ba, or even a bit stronger than him. His Red Jiao had also broken through to Grade Eight Elementary Martial Saint from its previous strength of Grade Six Martial Saint in thirty years. This Demonic Beast had turned from a harmless foe to a powerful beast feared by many.</p>
 <p>Water dragons were considered mutated beings in the World of Nine Continents. They had one of the fastest growth rates, thus they had acquired the strength that could surpass many Demonic Beasts of the same grade. However, it would require a lot of luck to tame one Water dragon in the wild.</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu was currently feeling conflicted. She couldn’t help but worry for her daughter because if anything happened to herself, her children would be the first to suffer from being bullied by the others if they decided to stay at the Duanmu Residence in Duanmu City.</p>
 <p>“We should go together.” Lady Duanmu said with a smile as she looked at Duanmu Lingshuang.</p>
 <p>……..</p>
 <p>The news spreaded throughout the Seven Stars Country in a short period of time, but it would take a longer time for the news to spread to the other countries. By that time, the battle would be over, and the news would be meaningless.</p>
 <p>The next day, the Nine Continent Boots was ready to be used again. However, Qing Shui realized that the Seven Stars City was only two hours away. Thus, he decided not to use it for now. They were almost at the Di Residence, so if he use the Nine Continent Boots, they would accidentally surpass their intended destination making them to lose more precious time.</p>
 <p>It was now the afternoon of the second day. Qing Shui felt more nervous the closer they got to the Di Residence, he had wanted to go back quickly because of Di Chen.</p>
 <p>He was uninterested in the Di Clan. Everything that he did, was for Di Chen’s sake!</p>
 <p>“Are you worried?” The old woman laughed when she saw Qing Shui’s worried expression.</p>
 <p>“I am just afraid that Old Demon Ba would arrive at the Di Residence first.” Qing Shui said in an honest tone.</p>
 <p>“Even though the Red Jiao has a decent speed, it does not have a remarkable ability to teleport itself to the Di Residence that fast.” The old woman said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Regardless, those words had a comforting effect on Qing Shui. At times when someone was worried, they would prefer to listen to things that they would like to hear, even if those things were only wishful thinking.</p>
 <p>They were almost at the Di Residence!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui probed the surrounding area with his Spiritual Sense. This ability had unknowingly gotten much stronger than before because he could clearly hear every swivel of the grass from the touch of the breeze nearby.</p>
 <p>He didn’t sense any strong vibration of aura around the Di Residence, and there was no scent of a bloody fight. He looked at the serene atmosphere around the Di Residence and finally calmed down when he realized Old Demon Ba didn’t arrive yet.</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird gave out a loud call when it reached the sky above the residence and then landed on an empty field in the courtyard. It was also an area specifically reserved for the landing of large-sized beasts, although just temporarily. Otherwise, without supervision, it would have turn to a zoo of demonic beasts very quickly.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and the old woman dismounted from the Fire Bird, Di Xuan and the other members of the Di Clan walked out to greet them. Their faces were filled with smiles as they saw Qing Shui, while Qing Shui had his gaze fixed on Di Chen and Di Qing.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked back with placid eyes, which instantly gave Qing Shui a sense of comfort. It was like a type of understanding in the absence of words, as if they had a connection like a pair of soulmates.</p>
 <p>It was a warmth that could be felt within the deepest parts of their hearts.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui and Di Qing had locked their eyes onto each other by accident. Her eyes showed emotions of gratitude, but there was also something else in her gaze that he couldn’t understand as she stared intensely at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Grandma, let me introduce them to you. This is Di Xuan of the Di Clan, and Madam Di….”</p>
 <p>“And this is the grandma from the Village of Mo Clan.” Qing Shui gave a simple introduction to everyone.</p>
 <p>“You are Madam Mo?” said Di Xuan with a surprised face.</p>
 <p>“Eh, someone still remembers me. It’s been a long time since someone called me that. I’m already an old woman, so I am unfit for that title.” The old woman shook her head as she forced a smile.</p>
 <p>“In any case, Old Madam Mo, we are really glad that you are here.” Di Xuan said very happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was perplexed. It seemed that Old Madam Mo was used to be quite powerful, but her powers have declined from what she hinted before.</p>
 <p>“This time I will need everyone to do their best. I am already quite useless compared to my younger days.”</p>
 <p>Di Xuan quickly conveyed a few polite words to the Old Madam Mo. It was funny that she had said that because she was still far stronger than Di Xuan.</p>
 <p>Everyone seemed happy as they headed towards a large room inside.</p>
 <p>“Sir, any news about Old Demon Ba?” Qing Shui had asked Di Xuan as soon as he entered the living room.</p>
 <p>There were about eleven people inside the living room, including Qing Shui, Old Madam Mo, Di Xuan and Di Qing’s mother, Di Chen, Di Qing, Di Fentian, Di Fenxing, Di Xuan and his three other sons.</p>
 <p>Di Fentian’s two children were absent from the gathering.</p>
 <p>The members of the Di Clan inside this living room were all of Di Xuan’s bloodline. Di Xuan was considered to had the least thriving household among the six brothers, but his household was the most outstanding in the Di Clan.</p>
 <p>“Old Demon Ba is on his way with his Red Jiao, and they will most likely arrive here by dusk tomorrow.” said Di Xuan to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>And just like that, everyone had gathered within the Di Residence, as they patiently awaited the upcoming storm tomorrow. Di Xuan had arranged his people to escort Old Madam Mo to her room, while Qing Shui was arranged to stay together with Di Chen in one room once again….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what to say because he couldn’t lay his fingers on her anyway….. Di Chen smiled and whispered in his ears: “Tonight I will sleep with Qing ‘er, so you don’t have to worry anymore.”</p>
 <p>Her words were like marshmallows in his ears - soft and tender. Qing Shui burned up inside as if he had contracted a fever from the Cat Scratch Disease. If there weren’t any people around, he would have straight up gone and kiss her boldly. However, all of that was just wishful thinking.</p>
 <p>“I am not worried. Why don’t we sleep together tonight?” Qing Shui used the same tactic as Di Chen and whispered close to her ears.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen giggled softly as she whispered back to Qing Shui. After that, she left the room with Di Qing.</p>
 <p>The waiting game was a torment, especially when they were waiting for a calamity to strike. No one could focus on anything, but it there was one person who could still relax for a bit, it was Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Uncle!”</p>
 <p>“Uncle!”</p>
 <p>…….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked back when someone abruptly pulled his sleeves. When he turned around, there was a tall and delicate fifteen or sixteen years old girl with a well-developed body pouting her lips as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I have been calling out to you and all you did was ignore me.” said the girl, feeling insulted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui recognized this girl as Di Xian, Di Fentian’s daughter. He was shocked when he realized she had called him as uncle-in-law when she saw Qing Shui because Di Xian would only use that term for Di Qing’s or Di Chen’s husband. Di Qing was unbetrothed, and Di Chen was his lawfully wedded wife. So naturally, Di Xuan called out to him as ‘uncle’.</p>
 <p>However, he was never aware of that fact until now, because most people would call him as ‘Di Chen’s man’. When he heard her calling out ‘uncle’, he still had a feeling that she wasn’t calling out to him. Nevertheless, he smiled at the girl and said: “I was spacing out, so I didn’t hear you calling me. Uncle is really sorry.”</p>
 <p>The girl immediately laughed when she had heard him apologized. Smiles filled her delicate face, and Di Chen who was looking from afar had a smile on her face as well.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, you can call me Xian ‘er. Aunt Qing said you are very powerful, and I have never heard Aunt Qing praising someone like that, more so for a man. If you weren’t Aunt Chen’s man, I would have thought you were Aunt Qing’s man for sure.” The girl had said in a happy tone as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Cough cough, children should never say such things. Careful, Aunt Qing might look for you and give you a punishment.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose. This kid was definitely smart and cunning, but he was helpless because he always had trouble dealing with this kind of girls in the past.</p>
 <p>“Heh heh, teach me some moves after you have gotten rid of Old Demon Ba, okay? I want to teach a lesson to that dreadful woman in the city. She’s an evil fox who only knows how to steal another woman’s man away.” The girl huffed in anger.</p>
 <p>A mistress?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the girl with curiosity. He didn’t expect that she would already have someone at such a young age. But it wasn’t a surprise seeing how refined she was. The dawn of love normally began at around the age of sixteen or seventeen, and with such an excellent figure, it was no wonder that a lot of men would want to pursue her. There was a high chance that she would choose one suitable man amongst the long list of pursuers as her partner.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look at me, I am not talking about myself.” The girl huffed at Qing Shui when she had realized what he was thinking base on his expression.</p>
 <p>“You are sure that we can get rid of Old Demon Ba?” Qing Shui tried to change the topic to soothe her anger. It would be fruitless to get entangled with her problems right now.</p>
 <p>“Of course, my intuition is always correct.” The girl seemed proud at her sense of ‘achievement’.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a bit disappointed at her reply, but he would not fight back with a girl because of that. He just smiled and said: “Then we will get rid of Old Demon Ba successfully thanks to Xian ‘er and her prophecy.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, then it’s settled. After finishing off Old Demon Ba, you have to teach me two moves, and I want awesome moves, got it?” The girl smiled like a flower that had just blossomed.</p>
 <p>“Okay, if you think my moves are awesome, then I will teach you.” Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>……..</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The next day at around evening, a loud beast cry could be heard coming closer to the Di Residence. The cry had resounded to the skies around hundreds of radius.</p>
 <p>It was loud and high-pitched, but at the same time, the cries sounded chant-like. It was quite a remarkable sound.</p>
