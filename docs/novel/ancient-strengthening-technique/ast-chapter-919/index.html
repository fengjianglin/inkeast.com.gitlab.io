 <p><strong>AST 919 - Violet Jade Earrings, Funeral, What Will Come Will Eventually Come (teaser)</strong></p>
 <p>“Why are you giving me a gift?” Mu Qing smiled and looked at Qing Shui, appearing very calm.</p>
 <p>“Do I need to have a reason to do it? Back then, why did you give me the Sky Penetrating Grass, Sunstones and such?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Mu Qing. He knew what it was that Mu Qing wanted to hear but at this moment, he didn’t wish to say it.</p>
 <p>“You’re my greatest affinity in this life. Am I really that unbearable?” Mu Qing held the box, lowered her head and said softly.</p>
 <p>“Where’s your confidence as the city’s top beauty? Don’t you know that I’m already slightly interested? If you were to lead me on too much, I might just devour you whole,” Qing Shui sighed and said.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui, biting her lips. She gently opened the box with a slight smile on her face. What appeared before her was a beautiful pair of violet colored Violet Jade Earrings. Compared to the Violet Jade Sword, it was more exquisite, as if it had not been the work of a human.</p>
 <p>Although Mu Qing knew that the item was very small from the size of the box, she had not expected it to be a pair of earrings for ladies. She smiled happily and said, “What an exquisite pair of earrings.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, she seemed to have gone deep into thought. It was because the material of this pair of earrings was exactly the same as that of the Violet Jade Sword. She couldn’t help but look at Qing Shui in astonishment, “You were the one who made this.”</p>
 <p>“Mmm, do you like it?”</p>
 <p>“I do!” Mu Qing handed the Violet Jade Earrings and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>When passed the Violet Jade Earrings, Qing Shui was stunned and asked, puzzled?, “Why are you handing it to me?”</p>
 <p>“You blockhead, I want you to put them on for me,” Mu Qing looked at Qing Shui and chided while blushing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, picked up the Violet Jade Earrings. His hands trembled slightly when he saw her beautiful earlobes and her snow white slender neck.</p>
 <p>He had put on earrings for Huoyun Liu-li before but now, he realized that his hands were not very nimble. When he came into contact with that beautiful ear, he felt that soft feeling and Mu Qing’s slight tremble, he could only smile bitterly.</p>
 <p>The ears were a sensitive spot for many people and could even well be the most sensitive spot for some. This was especially so when they were touched by people one liked. The reaction would be even stronger.</p>
 <p>This pair of Violet Jade Earrings was made by Qing Shui with his Penta-Colored Rainbow Art of Forging. He had made over ten sets of earrings. It would not only strengthen his foundations in his Art of Forging, he could also use them as presents. These things were not for sale even if one had money to afford it.</p>
 <p>After putting it on, Mu Qing felt a cooling and pure power rising within her. She looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. To think that this pair of earrings was so powerful that it could increase her abilities to be two times as strong as before (excluding strength gained from external items. It was based on one's strengths from one's physical body and martial techniques alone).</p>
 <p>Mu Qing forgot her feelings of embarrassment and looked at Qing Shui for a while. The more she got to know him, the more she felt that he was like a puzzle which couldn't be solved, making her get closer to attempt to solve it.</p>
 <p>"How is it?" Mu Qing smiled and met Qing Shui's gaze.</p>
 <p>"Beautiful, you're beautiful like a piece of jade." Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Just as Mu Qing was about to say something, Dong Yan and Sun Yan arrived. They saw Qing Shui and Mu Qing standing very closely together. From the side, it might make one think of some scenes that would make the blood boil.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the two of them were saying something between themselves, Mu Qing stood up, "You guys can chat. I've something to attend to and will head back first."</p>
 <p>"3rd Brother, when are you going to marry Miss Mu?" Sun Yan smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"Alright, stop with the jokes. We haven't settled our problems yet," Qing Shui shook his head and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"That's true. We don't know when those two old men will come back. Even if they did, it would be 3rd Brother fighting against them alone," Dong Yan shook his head helplessly as he said this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Violet Jade Scythe and that Violet Jade Sword which was slightly wider and passed them to Dong Yan and Sun Yan respectively.</p>
 <p>"3rd Brother, this thing looks quite nice," Dong Yan picked it up casually and said. However, he had just finished his words when his eyes suddenly popped open, as if he was in disbelief. He stood up, waved it a few times and then stood there in a daze, not saying a word.</p>
 <p>"Haha, 3rd Brother, thanks," Dong Yan didn't stand on courtesy with Qing Shui and said happily.</p>
 <p>"We're brothers. There's no need to stand on ceremony," Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>When Sun Yan picked up the Violet Jade Sword, he was no better than Dong Yan. Although he didn't say anything, that joy was still clearly reflected on his face. He said, feeling embarrassed, "I've received so much from 3rd Brother... I owe you too much as well...."</p>
 <p>"We're brothers. We don't owe each other anything. I'm the one who is willing to give these to the two of you." Qing Shui shook his head and smiled, saying. From the point when the two of them stood together with him, not fearing death, Qing Shui had treated them as he would treat his real brothers.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Another day passed by. Waiting was an agonizing thing to do, especially when one was waiting without knowing what to expect. It was because such a wait was like waiting for death. Luckily, there was still some hope.</p>
 <p>After leaving Mu Clan's old man's place the other time, Qing Shui had not appeared at all. Just as he was about to head out, the door was opened. Mu Qing stood at the door, appearing very sorrowful, eyes red.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's heart leaped, "Mu Qing, what's wrong?"</p>
 <p>"Old Ancestor has gone!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned and he felt really helpless. Mu Clan's old man had said before that he would not die before the two old guys did. Why had he passed away? With the old man around, Qing Shui could feel that the burden on his shoulders was lighter. But now that he was gone, it meant that he would have to pick up everything here by himself.</p>
 <p>"Come, let's go take a look!" Qing Shui gave it some thought before saying.</p>
 <p>The two of them headed to the backyard and realized that many people had already gathered. Each of them had a sorrowful look on their faces. Mu Fengyang and the other members of Mu Clan were tear stricken. Although Mu Clan's old man didn't bother with what was happening outside, with him around, he was there to give support if anything were to happen. However, he had collapsed.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui had come, Mu Fengyang walked over while the others made way for him.</p>
 <p>"Old Master, I offer my condolences. Sir is considered to have lived out his life peacefully. He should have left with a smile," Qing Shui offered a word of condolence and went in with Mu Fengyang.</p>
 <p>The room didn't appear luxurious but instead, had a rustic feel. He looked at the peaceful old man lying down on the bed. Qing Shui took his pulse and affirmed that the old man had passed away. A faint smile on the old man's face indicated that he had truly left happily.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, Old Ancestor has left a letter for you." Mu Fengyang handed Qing Shui an envelope.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very helpless. The words of the dead carried the greatest weight. Qing Shui opened the envelope on the spot. He knew that the old man had definitely left everything in his hands.</p>
 <p>‘Qing Shui, when you see this letter, I've already left this world. I'm very happy.</p>
 <p>Don't be worried, don't let them feel sad. I didn't do what I've promised you.</p>
 <p>Don't worry, those two old guys don't have many days to live either. Since you were able to calmly defeated Tianyu Liangyi who had attained a breakthrough, you won't have to worry about those two old men. However, you must still be careful.</p>
 <p>This old man thanks you. Mu Qing is a good girl. Everyone knows her feelings toward you. You're the first guy this lass has ever liked since she was young. If you like her as well, please treat her well.</p>
 <p>I hope that you will be able to help take care of the Mu Clan in the future as well. I'll give you my blessings in the netherworld.’</p>
 <p>After reading the letter, Qing Shui handed it to Mu Fengyang. He didn't wish to let other people suspect that he had gotten some treasure from the Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>"This was what Old Ancestor has given you. We can't read it," Mu Fengyang shook his head and said.</p>
 <p>"Take a look. There are no secrets. You guys should read it!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The funeral for Mu Clan's old man was fixed to be on the next day. In this world, the dead called the shots and it was better to let them rest in peace earlier.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing read that letter too. She didn't say anything, nor get close to Qing Shui intentionally.</p>
 <p>Everyone was very worried about the two old men from the Sky Prison Sect. They hoped to be able to let Mu Clan's old man rest in peace underground before the two of them came.</p>
 <p>On this day, everyone in the Mu Clan was very busy setting up the mourning hall. Many people from the city came to pay their respects. Mu Clan was currently in an ambiguous position. Although there were people who didn't think that the Mu Clan would do well, many of them still sensed that something was different.</p>
 <p>Once someone came forward to pay their respects, many others would follow, even the people from the Yin Clan.</p>
 <p>It was because if the Mu Clan were to pull through this ordeal, what they have done today would be very important. At least, they wouldn't have any weaknesses that others could capitalize on. And even if the Mu Clan were to be wiped out, they wouldn't lose out either.</p>
 <p>On this day, Qing Shui felt slightly uneasy as well. He kept having the feeling that the two old men from the Sky Prison Sect would be coming immediately. Most importantly, Qing Shui's senses tended to always be right.</p>
 <p>The day passed by without any dangers. There would still be people coming to offer their respects tomorrow and the burial will only be in the afternoon. Other than the people left behind to keep vigil beside the coffin, the others went back to take a rest. Tomorrow might not be a peaceful day.</p>
 <p>Cultivating throughout the night, Qing Shui felt that his forging skills had been stabilized and so had his cultivation. He was not only worried about the two old men from the Sky Prison Sect but he also had some anticipation.</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui woke up very early. Or rather, he had not slept after coming out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He would occasionally go up into mid-air to take a look at the surroundings.</p>
 <p>The sky gradually lit up and there were still many people coming to pay respects. Many of them were in no hurry to leave after paying their respects. There were many tables and chairs laid out with tea and such prepared for these guests who had traveled long distances to come.</p>
 <p>Late morning!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted his head to look at the sky. He hoped that his feeling was wrong and they would only come after Mu Clan's old man had been buried. He didn't wish for the old man's funeral to be disrupted.</p>
 <p>After about another hour!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a huge roar rang out from afar.</p>
 <p>This sound caused everyone to be astonished.</p>
 <p>They've come. What that will come will eventually come. But why did they have to choose this timing....</p>
 <p>"Proceed with the funeral. Leave it to me," Qing Shui said to Mu Fengyang and the others.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui..."</p>
 <p>"It's fine. No one can disturb the old man's funeral!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's voice was cold and piercing. No only the people from the Mu Clan heard it, even the other people who had came to pay their respects could hear his words clearly. The prowess of Qing Shui's spirit energy caused everyone to feel a chill down their spine.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui darted out like an arrow, each step he took looked like an illusion, making everyone amazed.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Closing in, Qing Shui could see them clearly. There was a huge Wolf-Headed Jadewater Hawk with two men of extremely old age. They should be about Mu Clan's old man's age but more powerful compared to him.</p>
 <p>Both old men were dressed in violet, their snow white hair reaching down to their waists. Their murky eyes were filled with a deathly aura as they stared at the young man who had stopped them in their tracks.</p>
 <p>"Lad, you're really amazing to be able to force out two old men who are at the age where we're near death. If only you were someone from our Sky Prison Sect." The old man in the lead seemed to be exclaiming and yet feeling that it was a pity.</p>
