 <p><strong>Chapter 427 Wenren Wushuang, Refining Success, Drawing Tailsman.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 427 - Wenren Wushuang, Refining Success, Drawing Tailsman</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Wenren Wushuang who was crying very hard in his embrace. Even though she was crying, Qing Shui felt relieved. Previously, Qing Shui let her leave Qing Clan to go to Skysword Sect as he wanted her to have some time to herself.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After noticing a huge increase in her strength, Qing Shui knew that it must have been very difficult for her during this period. Maybe it was to forget the wound in her heart, even if she was consoling herself, she should at least be halfway through her healing process. However, Qing Shui knew that she could not assuage the anger and hatred in her heart. Through grief and anger, she gain strength. Otherwise, she would not have improved so fast.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang hugged Qingshui tightly for almost four hours, sobbing in his embrace. When she looked up at Qing Shui, the tear stains on her face made his heart ache.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a large wet patch on the chest area of his clothes. As the saying goes, “women are made of water”. Qing Shui could not believe that so much tears would pour out from this pair of beautiful eyes that Wenren Wushang had.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, your elder sister wouldn’t want to see you like this. If you don’t want to let her down, please continue living happily. She can only go in peace this way. Don’t let her death be in vain.” Qing Shui &nbsp;held her lightly by her shoulders.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I know. I really do. But my heart hurts. Qing Shui, it really hurts. I really miss my sister. How I wish she was alive and at my side.” Wenren Wushuang coarse voice was filled with indignation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, trust me. You still have me. You are not alone. Whatever happens in the future, just talk to me. We can share the burden. I feel so sad when I see you like this. There are many people who care for you. Don’t be so upset.” Qing Shui consoled with smile as he helped her wipe her tears.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang looked at Qing Shui and nodded her head. She had known Qing Shui for a long time and the relationship between them had long surpassed friendship. It was just that both of them did not specifically recognised this fact.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang knew that Qing Shui liked her. He had liked her for a long time. But Wenren Wushuang was not so sure now. Just as women are fickle, men’s lust grow at the same pace as their capabilities and ambition.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A useless man can lust but will not have the courage to act on it. Capable men, however, will be surrounded by beautiful women without even doing anything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And so, Qing Shui and Wenren Wushuang chatted about many things as they took a walk by the back of the mountain.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, why do you think humans must live?” Wenren Wushang brought up this negative topic. Holding her hand, QIng Shui could feel that she was not dispirited.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, there isn’t a right answer for this question. Giving a profound answer based on moral high grounds will sound too hypocritical, yet giving an answer based on one’ self interest and perspective is too vulgar. However, I have come across two practical answers. Do you want to know?” Qing Shui clenched Wenren Wushuang’s hand. Qing Shui didn’t want to mention familial ties. In front of Wenren Wushuang, Qing Shui didn’t want to use such words. He wanted to say something that would diffuse the atmosphere.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Okay, do say.” Wenren Wushang seemed very interested.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The first type, are people who have not lived long enough. Death isn’t anything to them. But they can’t stand the pain from dying. Think about it, it must be very painful, so much that you could die from it…” Qing Shui said laughing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“To feel a pain that is so painful that you could die, isn’t that when you are about to die?” &nbsp;a Wenren Wushuang quipped.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Death is a painful process. Many people don’t die instantly. Even if they die instantly, they would be have been so afraid before they died.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What about the second type?” Qing Shui had already calmed himself down. Wenren Wushang turned to look Qing Shui’s side profile. At this moment, she realized that the previously boyish young man had already gone through some vicissitudes of life or now had a more mature aura.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The second which I agree with, is that because everyone else is still alive.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushang was slightly surprised then she laughed softly. Her set of pearly white teeth showed. They were so beautiful that they were like white michelia flowers under the sun. Her beauty was not as transcendental as Yiye Jiange or the Mistress of Misty Hall. Nor was it like the gorgeousness of Canghai Mingyue that could collapse cities. Much less like the coquettishness of Huoyun Liu-li.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was like a beautiful woman that was within reach, slightly warm and comforting and hopeful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui sent Wenren Wushuang to Zhu Qing Peak, the skies have already darken. QIng Shui was hesitant to go to Zhu Qing’s place. The impression that Qing Shui had about her had changed after she became so skinny. She became so skinny because she wanted to kill herself because of him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But he had spent most of the time with her on the bed….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui came to the familiar courtyard and saw the familiar figure, there was a sweet feeling in his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the &nbsp;mature buxomy “subservient” woman saw him, Qing Shuhui could clearly see the joy in her eyes. She immediately lunged herself into Qing Shui’s arms. She hugged Qing Shui’s neck tightly. Her gorgeous eyes were filled with joy. She lift her head to look at Qing Shui. Her pink lips were slightly pouted, they were lovely and sexy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Zhu Qing called Qing Shui’s name, her soft face turned a scarlet red. Her pair of watery beautiful eyes caused ripples in Qing Shui’s calm heart. It only took awhile for them to become huge waves.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Looks like I have to satisfy your hunger, you bewitching demon.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried her across his arms and blew into her ear.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, don’t say that!” Zhu Qing held on to Qing Shui’s neck and buried her face in his chest.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Did you miss me?” Qing Shui smiled as he placed her on the soft bed. The room was cozy and the bed was comfortable. Qing Shui pressed his body against Zhu Qing’s devilishly alluring body and asked with a light laugh.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course. I miss you everyday.” Zhu Qing held on to Qing Shui’s neck. Her two beautiful arms forced her erected mounds forward, so much so that they were almost touching Qing Shui’s face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;A light pleasant scent to lilac wafted into Qing Shui’s nose.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I also missed you!” Qing Shui said as he looked into that pair of clear water-like eyes. After he said that, he buried his blissful face into her lovely twin peaks, he submerged himself in that ocean of soft satin skin.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They frolicked intensely in the room till the moon rose. It was already 2 hours since. Zhu Qing was totally spent as she curled up and laid in Qing Shui’s arms indolently. She did not even move a bit. She had a &nbsp;satisfied smile on her &nbsp;seductive face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only left when Zhu Qing had fallen asleep. But as he left, Zhu Qing woke up. There was some disappointment in her eyes but it was quickly replaced with a smile. The immediate change made it apparently that she had thought about a lot of things and had came to accept a lot of things.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui returned to Cloud Mist Peak. He returned to the room he stayed in before. It was like before, there was no dust and the mattress was new. Qing Shui guessed that it was changed not long ago.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thinking about how Yiye Jiange has done this, he felt a sense of warmth in his heart. After think about it for a moment, he entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He channeled one large cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique. He then grabbed his Heaven Shaking Hammer and practiced his Thousand Hammer Technique, Diamond Qi</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After half a day, he had finally finish practicing what he needed to. Then, he walked towards the twenty vats of Darkgold Three-headed Python blood.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Refining Demonic Beast blood!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beast Blood possess a great amount of energy but the blood is not “clean”. Its “Ruthlessness”, “Malevolence” and its “Stench” had to be removed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It is like the difference between the color red and blood red. Even though they are all reds, but people don’t feel fear when they see red. However, when they see blood red, their heart will race, they will be afraid and it might even cause them to faint.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Drawing talismans requires the cleansed energy of the demonic beast blood. Now Qing Shui was certain that the Portraits of Beauty were drawn using Demonic beast blood.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the world of the nine Continents, not all demonic beast blood are red. Even though most of them are red, there are all other sorts of colours. There are even those which are mixed, for example bi-colors, tri-color, quad-color and the maximum that it could reach was rainbow color. Even though there were many beauty in the Portraits of Beauty were drawn with many different colours. Qing Shui was not certain if &nbsp;any were mixed colors.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even some humans have blood which are not red but there is rare. For example, gold, people with gold blood are rumored to be naturally-born martial warrior, once they are matured, the innate gift of their blood will awaken and allow them to constantly gain breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Purple blood is another type. This type of person exceed even those with gold blood. Even though unlike gold blood their blood will not be automatically activated when they mature, they are very talented in cultivation, they could be 10 times better than the average person. Most importantly, people with purple blood have an exceptional level of spirit energy. They could be top warriors, top beast tamers or even the rarest of all in Central Continent, the &nbsp;“Divine Psionicist” who can use psionic attacks and possess psychokinesis. The higher their spirit energy level, the larger the item they can control, the quicker and further they can throw the item...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Gold blood and purple blood belong to the noblest lineages acknowledge by the whole of the world of Nine continents. It is rumored that in the world of &nbsp;the Nine Continents, clans with such blood types are all the top clan in the Central Continent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were not many differences between refining demonic beast blood and refining demonic beast skin. Refining beast blood requires a vessel. Qing Shui was using the bronze cauldrons that he had forged, and he could only get the purest red color if he managed to refine and get rid of those fear causing factors.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This could be why talismans were drawn using blood to ward off evil spirits, although Heavenly talismans were not used to ward off evil spirits, and not all all Heavenly talismans were drawn with red blood either.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Lin Zhanhan was here, he would have been jaw-dropping shocked. This was because Qing Shui’s “Blood Refining” had improved so much that it was apparent to the naked eye. Even this current refining will produced blood with a higher purity level than Lin Zhanhan’s which is purified with his 10 over years of experience.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was because Qing Shui could use Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature energy could be used to ward evil and to prevent troubles of the heart. In terms of removing negativity, it was the most powerful righteous Qi in Heaven and Earth &nbsp;. Even though Qing Sjui had not successfully refined the beast blood, he could feel that things were smooth sailing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The blood in the cauldron bubbled as if it was boiling. There was a constant gurgling sound and occasionally there was a “zi zi” sound.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The previous time, he only spent a short amount of time refining. He was very tired so he had lose focus and control. It had accidentally “refined away” some of the energy in the blood.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui had forgotten that he did not use Nature Energy the previous time. Today, Qing Shui had a very good feeling that he did not have before. It was like finding out that every question in an exam was something you have done before. You are so adept at solving the questions that you can complete the exam in one go.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a bright red flow flashed, Qing Shui knew that he had succeed. He hestiated a moment before he opened the lid. A fresh smelling scent spilled out.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not describe the smell, it wasn’t a fragrant odor but it had a refreshing scent. It was nice smelling and he could feel the wave of spiritual energy in it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he saw the Darkgold Three-headed Python blood, Qing Shui was stunned. It was dark red, or rather pure red. Qing Shui felt that it was beautiful. Even if someone was told that this was blood, it will be very hard to believe.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It did not even had the scent of blood. When Qing Shui was observing Lin Zhanhan draw talismans, the blood stench of the demonic beast blood he used was extremely strong. Qing Shui could even smell it from the first floor. According to the Ancient Records of Heavenly Talisman, some of the high level talismans require refined demon beast blood which did not reek of the smell of blood.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was written in &nbsp;the Ancient Records of Heavenly Talisman that when drawing high level talisman or creating art, it was common to use blood which already had their stench removed. It was like Beauty of Portraits created by the art maestro. Qing Shui now knew that the blood was at least from Martial Saint Level beasts and the purification of that blood does not even allow for a single flaw.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It seemed to him that the Art Maestro was not only outstanding in his painting skills but was also a martial warrior who was at least at the level of Martial Saint. There were many types of techniques in the world, Qing Shui felt that the Art Maestro definitely practiced other sort of cultivation techniques, it might be even something related to drawing talisman.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he watched the successfully refined demonic beast blood, Qing Shui felt an indescribable vague feeling. It was like when he was in his past world when he saw a dog once or maybe a few times...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were ten over successfully refined talisman-shaped beast skin; the demonic beast blood was also ready; he could start drawing the talimans.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt excited when he thought about drawing talisman. This was because he knew that some of the talismans affect the opponent based on the creator’s capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When it comes to Qing Shui, 10% of his current defence is comparable to 40% or more of another martial warrior at the same grade. After all, Qing Shui had consumed the “Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core” which was at heaven defying levels and he basically uses the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, it was only for his base defence, if the effect was based on his total defence, Qing Shui will be even more overpowered.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Whether its effect is to lower the opponent’s status or boost his own, the effect only applies to the person’s base strength, speed, defence… Other sort of boosted effects from pills which provided temporal effects, armors, etc are not taken into the equation. Otherwise, when QIng Shui wear his Seven Star Armored Vest, he will be too heaven defyingly strong. Luckily, “Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core” was something that boosted his base defence.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he did not need his cultivation in Talisman Arts to be that high for it to be a great help to him. If he meet anyone with low defence, he will use “Damage Defence Talisman” and “Binding Talisman” if he meets a slow opponent. The prerequisite was that the level of one’s attribute must greatly exceed the opponent’s. Qing Shui knew that this was common knowledge to anyone who draws talisman. But usually people who draw talisman may have very high spiritual levels but not very outstanding stats. Thus, low level talismans which lower the stats of opponents are pretty much useless. Talisman masters will also work hard to greatly boost one of their best attributes such as strength, speed or defence.. This is to increase the effectiveness of their talismans.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Lin Zhanhan had advised him that people who practice Heavenly Talismans and achieve a high level of proficiency in it usually only focus on one type of talisman. It is difficult to cultivate multiple types of talisman. Most Talisman masters would be able to cultivate more than one type of talisman, but they will have one which is much more advanced that the other talismans.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 427 - Wenren Wushuang, Refining Success, Drawing Tailsman</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Wenren Wushuang who was crying very hard in his embrace. Even though she was crying, Qing Shui felt relieved. Previously, Qing Shui let her leave Qing Clan to go to Skysword Sect as he wanted her to have some time to herself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After noticing a huge increase in her strength, Qing Shui knew that it must have been very difficult for her during this period. Maybe it was to forget the wound in her heart, even if she was consoling herself, she should at least be halfway through her healing process. However, Qing Shui knew that she could not assuage the anger and hatred in her heart. Through grief and anger, she gain strength. Otherwise, she would not have improved so fast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang hugged Qingshui tightly for almost four hours, sobbing in his embrace. When she looked up at Qing Shui, the tear stains on her face made his heart ache.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a large wet patch on the chest area of his clothes. As the saying goes, “women are made of water”. Qing Shui could not believe that so much tears would pour out from this pair of beautiful eyes that Wenren Wushang had.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, your elder sister wouldn’t want to see you like this. If you don’t want to let her down, please continue living happily. She can only go in peace this way. Don’t let her death be in vain.” Qing Shui &nbsp;held her lightly by her shoulders.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I know. I really do. But my heart hurts. Qing Shui, it really hurts. I really miss my sister. How I wish she was alive and at my side.” Wenren Wushuang coarse voice was filled with indignation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, trust me. You still have me. You are not alone. Whatever happens in the future, just talk to me. We can share the burden. I feel so sad when I see you like this. There are many people who care for you. Don’t be so upset.” Qing Shui consoled with smile as he helped her wipe her tears.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang looked at Qing Shui and nodded her head. She had known Qing Shui for a long time and the relationship between them had long surpassed friendship. It was just that both of them did not specifically recognised this fact.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang knew that Qing Shui liked her. He had liked her for a long time. But Wenren Wushuang was not so sure now. Just as women are fickle, men’s lust grow at the same pace as their capabilities and ambition.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A useless man can lust but will not have the courage to act on it. Capable men, however, will be surrounded by beautiful women without even doing anything.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And so, Qing Shui and Wenren Wushuang chatted about many things as they took a walk by the back of the mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, why do you think humans must live?” Wenren Wushang brought up this negative topic. Holding her hand, QIng Shui could feel that she was not dispirited.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, there isn’t a right answer for this question. Giving a profound answer based on moral high grounds will sound too hypocritical, yet giving an answer based on one’ self interest and perspective is too vulgar. However, I have come across two practical answers. Do you want to know?” Qing Shui clenched Wenren Wushuang’s hand. Qing Shui didn’t want to mention familial ties. In front of Wenren Wushuang, Qing Shui didn’t want to use such words. He wanted to say something that would diffuse the atmosphere.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Okay, do say.” Wenren Wushang seemed very interested.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The first type, are people who have not lived long enough. Death isn’t anything to them. But they can’t stand the pain from dying. Think about it, it must be very painful, so much that you could die from it…” Qing Shui said laughing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“To feel a pain that is so painful that you could die, isn’t that when you are about to die?” &nbsp;a Wenren Wushuang quipped.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Death is a painful process. Many people don’t die instantly. Even if they die instantly, they would be have been so afraid before they died.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What about the second type?” Qing Shui had already calmed himself down. Wenren Wushang turned to look Qing Shui’s side profile. At this moment, she realized that the previously boyish young man had already gone through some vicissitudes of life or now had a more mature aura.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The second which I agree with, is that because everyone else is still alive.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushang was slightly surprised then she laughed softly. Her set of pearly white teeth showed. They were so beautiful that they were like white michelia flowers under the sun. Her beauty was not as transcendental as Yiye Jiange or the Mistress of Misty Hall. Nor was it like the gorgeousness of Canghai Mingyue that could collapse cities. Much less like the coquettishness of Huoyun Liu-li.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was like a beautiful woman that was within reach, slightly warm and comforting and hopeful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui sent Wenren Wushuang to Zhu Qing Peak, the skies have already darken. QIng Shui was hesitant to go to Zhu Qing’s place. The impression that Qing Shui had about her had changed after she became so skinny. She became so skinny because she wanted to kill herself because of him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But he had spent most of the time with her on the bed….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui came to the familiar courtyard and saw the familiar figure, there was a sweet feeling in his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the &nbsp;mature buxomy “subservient” woman saw him, Qing Shuhui could clearly see the joy in her eyes. She immediately lunged herself into Qing Shui’s arms. She hugged Qing Shui’s neck tightly. Her gorgeous eyes were filled with joy. She lift her head to look at Qing Shui. Her pink lips were slightly pouted, they were lovely and sexy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Zhu Qing called Qing Shui’s name, her soft face turned a scarlet red. Her pair of watery beautiful eyes caused ripples in Qing Shui’s calm heart. It only took awhile for them to become huge waves.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Looks like I have to satisfy your hunger, you bewitching demon.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried her across his arms and blew into her ear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, don’t say that!” Zhu Qing held on to Qing Shui’s neck and buried her face in his chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Did you miss me?” Qing Shui smiled as he placed her on the soft bed. The room was cozy and the bed was comfortable. Qing Shui pressed his body against Zhu Qing’s devilishly alluring body and asked with a light laugh.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course. I miss you everyday.” Zhu Qing held on to Qing Shui’s neck. Her two beautiful arms forced her erected mounds forward, so much so that they were almost touching Qing Shui’s face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;A light pleasant scent to lilac wafted into Qing Shui’s nose.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I also missed you!” Qing Shui said as he looked into that pair of clear water-like eyes. After he said that, he buried his blissful face into her lovely twin peaks, he submerged himself in that ocean of soft satin skin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They frolicked intensely in the room till the moon rose. It was already 2 hours since. Zhu Qing was totally spent as she curled up and laid in Qing Shui’s arms indolently. She did not even move a bit. She had a &nbsp;satisfied smile on her &nbsp;seductive face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only left when Zhu Qing had fallen asleep. But as he left, Zhu Qing woke up. There was some disappointment in her eyes but it was quickly replaced with a smile. The immediate change made it apparently that she had thought about a lot of things and had came to accept a lot of things.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui returned to Cloud Mist Peak. He returned to the room he stayed in before. It was like before, there was no dust and the mattress was new. Qing Shui guessed that it was changed not long ago.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thinking about how Yiye Jiange has done this, he felt a sense of warmth in his heart. After think about it for a moment, he entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He channeled one large cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique. He then grabbed his Heaven Shaking Hammer and practiced his Thousand Hammer Technique, Diamond Qi</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After half a day, he had finally finish practicing what he needed to. Then, he walked towards the twenty vats of Darkgold Three-headed Python blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Refining Demonic Beast blood!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beast Blood possess a great amount of energy but the blood is not “clean”. Its “Ruthlessness”, “Malevolence” and its “Stench” had to be removed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It is like the difference between the color red and blood red. Even though they are all reds, but people don’t feel fear when they see red. However, when they see blood red, their heart will race, they will be afraid and it might even cause them to faint.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Drawing talismans requires the cleansed energy of the demonic beast blood. Now Qing Shui was certain that the Portraits of Beauty were drawn using Demonic beast blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the world of the nine Continents, not all demonic beast blood are red. Even though most of them are red, there are all other sorts of colours. There are even those which are mixed, for example bi-colors, tri-color, quad-color and the maximum that it could reach was rainbow color. Even though there were many beauty in the Portraits of Beauty were drawn with many different colours. Qing Shui was not certain if &nbsp;any were mixed colors.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even some humans have blood which are not red but there is rare. For example, gold, people with gold blood are rumored to be naturally-born martial warrior, once they are matured, the innate gift of their blood will awaken and allow them to constantly gain breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Purple blood is another type. This type of person exceed even those with gold blood. Even though unlike gold blood their blood will not be automatically activated when they mature, they are very talented in cultivation, they could be 10 times better than the average person. Most importantly, people with purple blood have an exceptional level of spirit energy. They could be top warriors, top beast tamers or even the rarest of all in Central Continent, the &nbsp;“Divine Psionicist” who can use psionic attacks and possess psychokinesis. The higher their spirit energy level, the larger the item they can control, the quicker and further they can throw the item...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Gold blood and purple blood belong to the noblest lineages acknowledge by the whole of the world of Nine continents. It is rumored that in the world of &nbsp;the Nine Continents, clans with such blood types are all the top clan in the Central Continent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were not many differences between refining demonic beast blood and refining demonic beast skin. Refining beast blood requires a vessel. Qing Shui was using the bronze cauldrons that he had forged, and he could only get the purest red color if he managed to refine and get rid of those fear causing factors.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This could be why talismans were drawn using blood to ward off evil spirits, although Heavenly talismans were not used to ward off evil spirits, and not all all Heavenly talismans were drawn with red blood either.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If Lin Zhanhan was here, he would have been jaw-dropping shocked. This was because Qing Shui’s “Blood Refining” had improved so much that it was apparent to the naked eye. Even this current refining will produced blood with a higher purity level than Lin Zhanhan’s which is purified with his 10 over years of experience.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was because Qing Shui could use Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature energy could be used to ward evil and to prevent troubles of the heart. In terms of removing negativity, it was the most powerful righteous Qi in Heaven and Earth &nbsp;. Even though Qing Sjui had not successfully refined the beast blood, he could feel that things were smooth sailing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The blood in the cauldron bubbled as if it was boiling. There was a constant gurgling sound and occasionally there was a “zi zi” sound.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The previous time, he only spent a short amount of time refining. He was very tired so he had lose focus and control. It had accidentally “refined away” some of the energy in the blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui had forgotten that he did not use Nature Energy the previous time. Today, Qing Shui had a very good feeling that he did not have before. It was like finding out that every question in an exam was something you have done before. You are so adept at solving the questions that you can complete the exam in one go.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a bright red flow flashed, Qing Shui knew that he had succeed. He hestiated a moment before he opened the lid. A fresh smelling scent spilled out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not describe the smell, it wasn’t a fragrant odor but it had a refreshing scent. It was nice smelling and he could feel the wave of spiritual energy in it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he saw the Darkgold Three-headed Python blood, Qing Shui was stunned. It was dark red, or rather pure red. Qing Shui felt that it was beautiful. Even if someone was told that this was blood, it will be very hard to believe.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It did not even had the scent of blood. When Qing Shui was observing Lin Zhanhan draw talismans, the blood stench of the demonic beast blood he used was extremely strong. Qing Shui could even smell it from the first floor. According to the Ancient Records of Heavenly Talisman, some of the high level talismans require refined demon beast blood which did not reek of the smell of blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was written in &nbsp;the Ancient Records of Heavenly Talisman that when drawing high level talisman or creating art, it was common to use blood which already had their stench removed. It was like Beauty of Portraits created by the art maestro. Qing Shui now knew that the blood was at least from Martial Saint Level beasts and the purification of that blood does not even allow for a single flaw.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It seemed to him that the Art Maestro was not only outstanding in his painting skills but was also a martial warrior who was at least at the level of Martial Saint. There were many types of techniques in the world, Qing Shui felt that the Art Maestro definitely practiced other sort of cultivation techniques, it might be even something related to drawing talisman.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he watched the successfully refined demonic beast blood, Qing Shui felt an indescribable vague feeling. It was like when he was in his past world when he saw a dog once or maybe a few times...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were ten over successfully refined talisman-shaped beast skin; the demonic beast blood was also ready; he could start drawing the talimans.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt excited when he thought about drawing talisman. This was because he knew that some of the talismans affect the opponent based on the creator’s capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When it comes to Qing Shui, 10% of his current defence is comparable to 40% or more of another martial warrior at the same grade. After all, Qing Shui had consumed the “Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core” which was at heaven defying levels and he basically uses the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, it was only for his base defence, if the effect was based on his total defence, Qing Shui will be even more overpowered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Whether its effect is to lower the opponent’s status or boost his own, the effect only applies to the person’s base strength, speed, defence… Other sort of boosted effects from pills which provided temporal effects, armors, etc are not taken into the equation. Otherwise, when QIng Shui wear his Seven Star Armored Vest, he will be too heaven defyingly strong. Luckily, “Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core” was something that boosted his base defence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he did not need his cultivation in Talisman Arts to be that high for it to be a great help to him. If he meet anyone with low defence, he will use “Damage Defence Talisman” and “Binding Talisman” if he meets a slow opponent. The prerequisite was that the level of one’s attribute must greatly exceed the opponent’s. Qing Shui knew that this was common knowledge to anyone who draws talisman. But usually people who draw talisman may have very high spiritual levels but not very outstanding stats. Thus, low level talismans which lower the stats of opponents are pretty much useless. Talisman masters will also work hard to greatly boost one of their best attributes such as strength, speed or defence.. This is to increase the effectiveness of their talismans.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Lin Zhanhan had advised him that people who practice Heavenly Talismans and achieve a high level of proficiency in it usually only focus on one type of talisman. It is difficult to cultivate multiple types of talisman. Most Talisman masters would be able to cultivate more than one type of talisman, but they will have one which is much more advanced that the other talismans.&nbsp;</p>
