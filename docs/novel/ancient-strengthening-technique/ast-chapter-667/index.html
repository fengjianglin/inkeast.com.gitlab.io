 <p><strong>AST 667 - Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death (5)</strong></p>
 <p>There was an emerald-green small condor on Sima Ye's shoulder. Its blood red eyes, mouth and claws, in contrast to its gentle appearance, made it hard to tell that it was actually a venomous condor.</p>
 <p>Blood Shadow Condor!</p>
 <p>This was the smallest condor species Qing Shui had seen, it was a Poison Beast amongst demonic beasts that specializes in speed. It was unlike the Poisonous Jade Green Snake which had a sudden attack speed as quick as lightning, but it needed to work together with a person to bring its greatest effect in close combat.</p>
 <p>Although this Blood Shadow Condor also needed to stay with someone, it had a greater advantage in terms of distance compared to the Poisonous Jade Green Snake. Moreover, its body was as tough as steel, its sharp claws could even tear apart some exquisitely made metals. As the Blood Shadow Condor was small in size, it would always tear apart the enemy's skin and dig into their bodies when it launched a quick attack. Its claws, mouth and eyes could all emit strong venom.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took another glance to find that the rest of the elders don’t had any Poison Beasts with them. However, just them alone were already troublesome as it was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at them then said to Di Xuan, "Senior, you'll deal with that elderly dressed in fine clothes."</p>
 <p>Di Xuan nodded.</p>
 <p>"Granny, you'll deal with that old man dressed in black clothes. However, don't engage in close combat, just try to stall him. After I've dealt with the remaining person, we'll join forces against him. If you find him hard to deal with, then use the Gale Pellet I gave you earlier. It can double your speed for about 15 minutes." Qing Shui said softly, as he maintained his gaze upfront.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I'll try my best."</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui's words carried the most weight. They believed in him, as they gave their trust to him almost blindedly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a bunch of Descending Heavens Talisman and quickly threw them out!</p>
 <p>At the same moment...</p>
 <p>"Kill!"</p>
 <p>Their three opponents did not dodge the Descending Heavens Talisman but had decided to attack quickly as everyone knew the importance of making the first move. More importantly, all three of them attacked Qing Shui. They knew that once this young man is killed, the remaining two would be no threat to them. However, if this young man stay alive, the other two will become strong experts that could take their lives.</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p>Shield attack!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had only activated the Fiery Golden Eyes when the opponents started to attack him. It had forced Qing Shui to quickly used the Seven Star Armored Vest and the Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>Boom boom...</p>
 <p>A series of loud sounds rang out as Qing Shui waved the Big Dipper Sword in his hand was at a great speed. In this situation where they were weaker than their opponents, although Old Madam Mo and the Di Xuan had both attacked, Qing Shui still had to accept a blow on Di Xuan's behalf. Under the effects of both the Descending Heavens Talismans and his Fiery Golden Eyes, the opponent's level was still slightly higher than 5000 countries.</p>
 <p>In that short moment when Qing Shui had let his guard down slightly...</p>
 <p>Ning!</p>
 <p>The Blood Shadow Condor on Sima Ye's shoulders, had pounced towards Qing Shui's face. As quick as lightning, its blood red claws were like a red demon's talons that gave out a fierce aura.</p>
 <p>Taichi Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>Striking after the opponent had attacked!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's expression did not change. As he released his grip on the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui's hand moved at an unbelievably slow speed and grabbed the Big Dipper Sword just as it was an inch away from his face.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Primordial flames!</p>
 <p>Ning!</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a strong meat fragrance was sent out as the demonic beast was burnt into nothingness.</p>
 <p>Even when Qing Shui used the Seven Star Armored Vest, he had still suffered some minor injuries from the earlier attacks. There were blood stains present at his shoulder.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had locked down Sima Ye with his Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>"Granny, I'll leave this to you."</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui threw out a hidden weapon to push back the old man dressed in black, then he unleashed his Emperor's Qi towards the finely dressed old man before Di Xuan quickly took over.</p>
 <p>Everything had happened in just an instant. Although the Lunar Silk Garment had absorbed a large part of the attack, Qing Shui was still injured.</p>
 <p>Now, Old Madam Mo could easily deal with Sima Ye, but Di Xuan had some problems as he dealt with the finely-dressed old man. Before the battle started, Qing Shui had used all of his beneficial talismans on their enemies. Di Xuan's level was still 500 countries lower than the finely-dressed old man, however, he could still hold on for a while.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui engaged Qianxi Lang!</p>
 <p>Even when Qing Shui had received a blow in just a short amount of time, they managed to hold down the situation and even killed the enemies’ Blood Shadow Condor.</p>
 <p>This Blood Shadow Condor had made Qing Shui worried since it could kill them if they were not careful. If Qing Shui had not managed to fend off that Blood Shadow Condor earlier, he would probably have his head pierced and died instantly.</p>
 <p>Prrrrttt!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant which appeared besides Di Xuan with a loud cry. Although the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was not strong, it could still somewhat put up a fight.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan had managed to turn the situation around together with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, with the help of its Diamond Sword Qi, Ferocious Diamond Attack and Instantaneous Diamond Evasion.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was left to deal with Qianxi Lang, which made him slightly relieved. Even though this old man in front of him was the strongest and the most dangerous, Qing Shui was confident that he can defeat him.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>This time, he did not panic and had locked him down with his Emperor's Qi.</p>
 <p>Although Qianxi Lang had witnessed the effects of the Descending Heavens Talismans earlier, he thought that it was nothing much. The Fiery Golden Eyes had made him upset because it caused them to lost all their advantages in terms of cultivation level. But even if this was the case, Qing Shui's side would still lose.</p>
 <p>However, he had sensed earlier that even though the other two had a strength that exceeded 6000 countries, they were now left with slightly over 4000 countries.</p>
 <p>It was the same for him, he only had a strength of 4500 countries now. At this moment, he even held impressions that Qing Shui could kill him in a split second.</p>
 <p>The battle continued and Old Madam Mo had overwhelmed Sima Ye, who was already injured in just a short moment. However, he continued to fight with the use of poison powders. If Old Madam Mo had not taken the Pure Jade Pellet, she would probably lose already even if she was stronger.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"The Di Clan must have an antidote against us. From the start, our poisons seem to not have that much effect." an elderly sighed as he stood outside Ten Thousand Poisons Sect's tent that was provided by the Qianxi Clan.</p>
 <p>"3rd Brother is right. Our Ten Thousand Poisons Sect are well known with the usage of poison. And now that our poison has lost their effects, our battle prowess were weakened by a lot."</p>
 <p>"It must be the Alchemist Sect. Only the Alchemist Sect can refine such a medicinal pill. They also have people supporting the Di Clan and they've always held a grudge against our Ten Thousand Poisons Sect. We should have taken action against them earlier." The old man from earlier said regretfully.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry. Seems like the few of us have to fight next. While his skills in weakening his opponents is powerful, his cultivation level is still weak. Otherwise, even us would not be able to do anything to him. For now, he's still too weak." A metallic-like voice rang out.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Wu!</p>
 <p>The Phantom Fire Wolf next to Qianxi Lang had howled to demonstrate his might, however it did not move. It stayed next to Qianxi Lang with its metal-like body tensed up.</p>
 <p>Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p>With the Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui was not worried as he pounced toward Qianxi Lang!</p>
 <p>Swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p>Ssss!</p>
 <p>Shield attack!</p>
 <p>Just as when he was about to collide with Qianxi Lang, two green snake heads had reached towards Qing Shui from the two sides of the Violet Gold Divine Shield and a pink-colored fireball also shot out from the right side of the shield.</p>
 <p>The two snakes' head spitted out a thin trail of green-colored liquid very quickly, and together with the fireball, it aimed towards Qing Shui's face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly retreated, as he used the Big Dipper Sword to block his face.</p>
 <p>It had really given Qing Shui a great fright. Although he could already sense that the two Poisonous Jade Green Snake would be troublesome, he had not expected that it could increase one's close combat abilities by so much.</p>
 <p>He could attack the Phantom Fire Wolf from afar even if the Phantom Fire Wolf which specializes in speed was quite powerful. With the other two Poisonous Jade Green Snake to support him, Qianxi Lang could be said to have no equal amongst those with the same cultivation level. He would even have a high chance of winning against people who were slightly stronger than him.</p>
 <p>"Since that's the case, I'll start on this beast first." Qing Shui's gaze was fixed on the Phantom Fire Wolf.</p>
 <p>Twin Dragon Pearls!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again threw out hidden weapons toward Qianxi Lang. Although it was not able to take his life, it could pushed him into a difficult corner.</p>
 <p>Demon Binding Ropes!</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui threw out the Demon Binding Ropes toward the Phantom Fire Wolf.</p>
 <p>The Demon Binding Ropes don’t have much effect on high level Martial Saint beasts, but it can be use to deal with Poison Beasts which were only good in speed.</p>
 <p>Swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p>Bound down, the Phantom Fire Wolf had let out an astonished cry as it glared at Qing Shui with his eerie and fierce gaze. It was a pity that there was nothing it could do. It could neither move nor attack.</p>
 <p>Sword pierce!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Big Dipper Sword slashed the Phantom Fire Wolf’s throat and he threw its corpse into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qianxi Lang watched painfully as his beloved Poison Beast was killed. It was much harder to train a Poison Beast than a demonic beast, especially one that was a good match for him.</p>
 <p>With the Phantom Fire Wolf out of the way, Qing Shui’s burdens had lessened.</p>
 <p>Twin Dragon Explosion!</p>
 <p>Binding Talisman!</p>
 <p>Body Securing Talisman!</p>
 <p>Armor Break Talisman!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first attacked with the Twin Dragon Explosion, which forced his opponent in a bad position, then he followed up with Binding Talisman. He also used other talismans as he had plenty which weakens the opponent at his disposal.</p>
 <p>This was why Qing Shui liked Heavenly Talismans the most. They were very convenient.</p>
 <p>The Body Securing Talisman had no effect. It might be because the mysterious energy on the talisman was too weak and did not have enough power to bind his opponent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's main goal was the Binding Talisman!</p>
 <p>As long as his opponent's speed was reduced, Qing Shui would be able to deal with him just with hidden weapons alone. In fact, Qing Shui could kill his opponent quickly but he did not want to take the risk. He could win the battle unscathed but he needed a little more time.</p>
 <p>Since there was plenty of time, safety should be prioritized.</p>
 <p>Attack!</p>
 <p>Halfway through, Qing Shui had activated the Blue Lotus Art!</p>
 <p>Three golden-colored lotus flowers surrounded him.</p>
 <p>Qianxi Lang's countenance had turned grim immediately! It was because he knew that the Poisonous Jade Green Snake on his arms were now useless.</p>
 <p>Frenzied Demonic Dance!</p>
 <p>With a wave of the Psychotic Demon Scythe in Qing Shui’s hand, a black fog had appeared in front of him, as it filled the surrounding area with a faint layer of black fog within a ten meter radius.</p>
