 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2348 - The Water Emperor’s daughter, Nalan Qing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui certainly did not expect to see her here. Though it hadn’t been long since they parted, they were practically unrelated back then, so meeting now felt like such a stretch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this dreamlike city, such a beautiful person had an unspeakable allure, standing there with unparalleled gracefulness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if she felt something that made Nalan Qing look at Qing Shui’s general direction, before she opened her mouth in surprise. She was in disbelief. She never thought that she would see this man again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Women were strange creatures. They were unable to resist the notion of fate. It was as if the words that Nalan Qing said previously had not disappeared. In fact, Nalan Qing had felt that their previous encounter was a final farewell and that there was no hope of another meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ms. Qing, we meet again. I don’t know if you remember what you said the last time…” Qing Shui was pretty happy that he met an acquaintance here, if she could even be counted as one. It was natural to feel happy, meeting familiar people in foreign places. It was one of life’s three great joys.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I remember. Come on. I’ll treat you to a drink,” Nalan Qing’s face was very soft and delicate. It was Qing Shui’s first time seeing this woman with such a gentle side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui followed as Nalan Qing led the way. Stepping on a clear crystal-like ground surface, accompanied by a beautiful person, Qing Shui felt a kind of indescribable satisfaction at that moment. It was a unique experience of its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What made you come here?” Nalan Qing asked, glancing towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is not much hindrance in the lower three regions any longer, so I came to the middle three regions to train while exploring more of the world at the same time. Do you live in this Crystal City?” Qing Shui questioned, smiling warmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I live here. I did not fathom that I would ever bump into you here.” Nalan Qing still felt surprised about the coincidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve been here in the Water Nation for quite a while, though I really never thought that you would be here. Oh, right… you live here.” Qing Shui felt surprised at the coincidence too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sister-in-law, who is this?” A voice suddenly called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after Qing Shui finished speaking, a group of men walked over, led by a young and good-looking man. He was dressed in a white robe and carrying a long sword. His laid-back attitude did not cause a bad first impression. Instead, it had some sort of charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beiyuan Maji, whom I talk to is none of your business. Leave me alone,” Nalan Qing coldly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re my brother’s woman. It seems like ever since my brother died, you no longer want to stay with the Beiyuan Clan,” The man jokingly said, finding joy in the way Nalan Qing eyes sparked with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What an animal,” Qing Shui exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where is this wild thing from? Do you even know who she is? If you are trying to take advantage of her, you wouldn’t even know how you died. Scram while you can. I don’t want to deal with you right now.” The man had self-control and would not be easily angered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who she is does not matter whatsoever. What is important is that you people get out of my vision right now. Stop interrupting our drinking session,” Qing Shui said with all seriousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beiyuan Maji laughed. He laughed till his eyes began to tear before looking at Qing Shui, “You’re such a joke. This woman here is the Water Emperor’s daughter, my brother’s girl, and my sister-in-law. Yet, you still asked us to scram before taking advantage of the Water Emperor’s daughter and my brother's girl.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui turned to Nalan Qing in surprise, “You’re the Water Emperor’s daughter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure enough, it’s a man who knows nothing. A foolish man like you is trying to take advantage of Nalan Qing. Such a beautiful woman, do you know how many men are eyeing her? Not even a prominent figure, just a country bum trying his luck with her. It’s just too funny,” Beiyuan Maji guffawed until there were tears rolling down his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui rubbed his nose. He didn’t think that someone would ever call him a country bum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon seeing Qing Shui’s awkward expression, Nalan Qing’s eyes softened. She faced Beiyuan Maji, “If you’ve had enough, you can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nalan Qing, you are a princess who has already been married out. To our Beiyuan Clan of all things. Since you married one from our family, you are now one of us, and you should never be linked to anyone else. But now here you are, hooking up with a stranger. If such news spread, it will surely bring shame to the royal family.” Beiyuan Maji said, winking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you to try and lecture me.” Nalan Qing’s cold glare caused Maji to shrink backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tyrannical, Nalan Qing was simply tyrannical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beiyuan Maji did not rage but simply laughed, “The Nalan Clan now is not like what it was in the past. Without our Beiyuan Clan, your father wouldn’t have a good end sitting on that throne.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Shui, let’s go for our drink now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing lightly said, completely ignoring Beiyuan Maji.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt something. It seemed like this woman was not particularly happy. He knew previously that this woman was of high status, but he did not think that she would be the Water Emperor’s daughter. Unfortunately, it seemed like there was an internal conflict over power in the Water Nation, and this conflict seemed to be growing larger day by day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon seeing Beiyuan Maji’s attitude just now, Qing Shui knew that the Water Emperor’s power was somewhat weak. If not, Beiyuan Maji would not have dared to disrespect Nalan Qing like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beiyuan Maji looked at their departing back views with a twinkle of mischief in his eyes, before leaving with his group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you have to deal with that person every day?” Qing Shui asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“More or less,” Nalan Qing replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you kill him off?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Killing him will bring much inconvenience to the Nalan Clan. I don’t want to bring trouble to my father.” Nalan hesitated for a bit before saying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does your father know the situation that you are in?” Qing Shui continued asking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He doesn’t know. If he did, he would kill Beiyuan Maji and begin attacking the Beiyuan Clan without hesitation,” Nalan Qing said as she shook her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sounds like what a good father would do,” Qing Shui nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He has always been a good father. You don’t need to say it,” Nalan Qing snapped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A good father isn’t one that gives his children position or status, but one who gives love instead, and is willing to do anything for their children. Parental love is selfless and it cannot be melted. Even beasts are willing to fight to death for their children, even more so for humans. You are still young. Wait until you have children and you will know,” Qing Shui nodded, full of experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing’s eyes widened upon hearing this guy talk about this so calmly and peacefully. Her husband had died. Even though she was simply unmarried now, her marriage had sealed her fate. She was widowed in the Beiyuan household. The fact that she was in the Beiyuan Clan meant that she still hadn’t done it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the beginning, Nalan Qing knew the situation. Although it was a political marriage, the Water Emperor still allowed her to make her own decision. At that time, Nalan Qing had happily agreed. The reason why she acted happily was to let the Water Emperor know that she was willing.&nbsp;</span></p>
