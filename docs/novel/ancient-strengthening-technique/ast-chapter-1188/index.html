 <p><strong>AST 1188 - Battle, I've Lost, Tian Jiange Lost</strong></p>
 <p>"Blacksmith? What kind of clan could let a blacksmith reach such a level? Amongst the countless population in our Great Yu Dynasty, how many of such people would there be?" The Third Prince was astonished beyond words.</p>
 <p>The reason he was able to invite Tian Jiange [1] was because the latter had owed him a great favor. Tian Jiange had promised to help him once in the future and the reason he had taken part this time around was so that he could repay the Third Prince and he was only going to do it to the best of his abilities, regardless of whether he would eventually win or lose.</p>
 <p>This was what the Third Prince had said as he had thought that once Tian Jiange were to take part, their victory would already be confirmed. Therefore, he didn't have to worry nor was he worried in the least.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Sky Sword！</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and although his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was at the second form, it wasn't what the ones Qing Shui had seen previously could compare against.</p>
 <p>Although it had an illuminated glow, it was more material and was in a silvery white color. Even the Sky Sword he was holding gave a feeling as if he had descended from the heavens. He had an extraordinary aura to him but even more so, killing intent.</p>
 <p>It was very contradicting and his aura was much more powerful compared to the ones from before. Qing Shui didn't dare to let his guard down. He took out his Big Dipper Sword and activated his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was a golden color and appeared very thick. It formed a very distinctive difference against Tian Jiange's silvery white form.</p>
 <p>Skysword Shadow！</p>
 <p>This time around, Tian Jiange attacked first. With a move, with a speed that was much faster than before, a sharp sword shadow shot out toward Qing Shui with a flash.</p>
 <p>It was like the spring breeze and fine drizzle, silent and stirless!</p>
 <p>Golden Sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his head as well and attacked with the Golden Sword in his Five Elements Divine Refining Technique. It clashed against the opponent's 天剑影 and they negated each other out!</p>
 <p>Heavenly Net Sword Slash！</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange instantly dashed out once again, bringing about many sword shadows to form a huge net, encompassing the surrounding sky.</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't panic. Lifting his Big Dipper Sword, a spread of ocean appeared around them, blocking the sword shadows that were coming in from all directions.</p>
 <p>Monstrous Wave!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his hand once again and many huge whirlpools appeared. The pitch-black whirlpools exuded a terrifying engulfing power, as if they were going to absorb the entire sky.</p>
 <p>Roaming Dragon Steps!</p>
 <p>Amidst the danger-filled ocean, Qing Shui was a huge dragon that was on a roll, advancing with a mysterious power and dashing toward Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still had some reservations. He didn't wish to kill Tian Jiange, nor did he wish to let him feel completely humiliated. Therefore, he decided to temporarily drag the fight on since he didn't wish to be targeted by the people from Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>If he could make it such that it didn't bring humiliation to Tian Jiange while he could still win, he believed that Tian Jiange won't let the people from Heaven Secrets Academy find trouble with him. Qing Shui wasn't afraid of people who were of his age but there were too many experts in Heaven Secrets Academy. If a few of them were to come and deal with him, he might just have to live like a fugitive.</p>
 <p>Might of Sky Sword！</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange didn't dare to let his guard down. Seeing that Qing Shui was able to easily fend off his Heavenly Net Sword Slash, he knew that Qing Shui has a great mastery in spirit energy.</p>
 <p>He raised his Sky Sword which rapidly grew bigger, exuding a rustic feel. It was as if this was an ancient huge sword, one which had descended from the heavens.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved his Big Dipper Sword, swinging the sword as his hand!</p>
 <p>Diamond Buddha Devil Staff!</p>
 <p>Four Staff Five Oceans Churning！</p>
 <p>A huge golden divine staff that was like a heavenly pillar appeared in the air. It was glimmery gold and there were many rustic Buddha images. It exuded profound power.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui himself was a little astonished. To think that his Diamond Buddha Devil Staff had now reached such a level and prowess. He would never have expected this at the very beginning. Only when one was strong, would the person then be able to unleash the prowess of martial techniques to their greatest.</p>
 <p>Anger of Sky Sword！</p>
 <p>The huge white sword Qi was stronger and it slashed down toward Qing Shui. A silver glow encompassed Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A loud clashing sound rang out. It was a deep sound that would cause the world to tremor, just like when two blocks of mountains were to clash together!</p>
 <p>Everything in the surroundings disappeared. Tian Jiange shook the longsword in his hand!</p>
 <p>Solar True Qi！</p>
 <p>The silvery-white longsword and his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation suddenly turned red. He appeared to be like a small, scorching sun!</p>
 <p>Solar True Fire Sword！</p>
 <p>The reason Tian Jiange could reach his cultivation level at such a young age was because he cultivated the powerful Solar True Fire Art, A powerful crimson red sword Qi that was over ten meters long burst out. The violent power outburst slashed out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Its speed was fast as sparks!</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>With a single thought, the Nine Continents Mountain appeared before Qing Shui and smashed out toward Tian Jiange while blocking the explosive Solar True Fire Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>With a flash, the profound Nine Palace positioning allowed Qing Shui to instantly appear near Tian Jiange!</p>
 <p>He raised his Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p>First Level of Xuantian Seal!</p>
 <p>What astonished Qing Shui was that this time around, the silver platform was much bigger than before. It was a shimmering silver light and the silver light encompassed Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>It might be because of the great increase to his spirit energy that this time around, the prowess of the Seal of Xuantian seemed to have gotten a lot stronger!</p>
 <p>Solar True Qi！</p>
 <p>The Solar True Qi on Tian Jiange exuded violently and negated the First Level of Xuantian Seal's ability to reduce speed and reaction.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't find this strange. It was because when he was using his spirit energy, there was no Buddha Form Reveal. Therefore, the spirit energy he struck out with now wasn't very terrifying.</p>
 <p>However, the Nine Continents Mountain's prowess had been displayed!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain smashed out toward Tian Jiange!</p>
 <p>The prowess of 13,000 clouds was very great. At the very least, Tian Jiange was sent flying.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain had a powerful Shield attack and even though Tian Jiange was very strong, his strength was probably only slightly higher than 10,000 nimbus. If he were to use the Solar True Fire Sword Qi his battle prowess would exceed 10,000 nimbus. However, the prowess of the Nine Continents Mountain's Shield attack was still very powerful. Moreover, this time around, Tian Jiange didn't have sufficient time to prepare for the block!</p>
 <p>Solar True Fire, flames！</p>
 <p>A gleam shone in Tian Jiange's eyes and the red glow on his body shone much brighter than before. The huge "red sword" slashed down on the Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>This time around, the Nine Continents Mountain was pushed back!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that if it wasn't because he had a tremendous increase in his strength, he wouldn't be able to deal with Tian Jiange. He should be barely considered a Grade Three State Master or could be said to be only Peak Grade Two State Master. One's abilities wasn't measured simply just by one's grade alone and it wasn't necessary such that one would be of a certain grade if they had a certain level of strength. Grade was something which should be seen from a general overview.</p>
 <p>For example, a Grade Two State Master must have the necessary strength, defense, speed, spirit energy, realm, endurance...</p>
 <p>Roc's Might!</p>
 <p>The Big Dipper Sword slapped down a Sword of Seventh Wave on the Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>The impact from this blow, in addition to the control of the Nine Continents Mountain's prowess through his mind, the Nine Continents Mountain smashed toward Tian Jiange with a terrifying power.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tian Jiange's countenance seemed to be a bit pale as he gave off a feeling of helplessness.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange squinted and with a few flashes, streams of red sword Qi smashed down on the Nine Continents Mountain. At the same time, with a wave of his hand, a huge demonic beast that was emanating flames all over appeared right next to him.</p>
 <p>This demonic beast was about 100 meters in size and was exuding flames from its body. It was covered in scales and looked like a bull. It had two huge horns on its head and spewed flames out from its nose was over ten meters long.</p>
 <p>The Three Primordial Solar Beast！</p>
 <p>This huge beast that was emanating flames had an even stronger aura than Tian Jiange. After coming to the Western Oxhe Continent, Qing Shui temporarily had no use for his demonic beasts. It was the same for the others. At their level, people tended to have stronger demonic beasts but it was difficult to tame a demonic beast that was stronger than yourself.</p>
 <p>The more power the demonic beast, the higher its intellect. While it might not be comparable to a human, in battles, it wouldn't be weaker than humans. This was their talent. Moreover, demonic beasts have far longer lifespans than humans.</p>
 <p>The Three Primordial Solar Beast was a powerful demonic beast from the ancient era. They exuded flames on their body and had scales for armor. Their powerful defense caused them to be undefeatable.</p>
 <p>The Three Solar Fire was a terrifying flame that was of the same level as the Golden Flames and the Li Fire, one of the most powerful flames. The explosive Three Solar Fire was one of extreme yang and was a power which was capable of destroying everything and would light up even water.</p>
 <p>Its two huge fire horns and thick and muscular limbs gave it terrifying physical strength as well. It would even be able to penetrate a mountain or crumble it.</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain and sent it smashing toward the Three Primordial Solar Beast!</p>
 <p>Dong!</p>
 <p>What that astonished Qing Shui was that the 13,000 clouds strength could only cause this huge beast to tremble. It wasn't even able to stop the beast in its tracks.</p>
 <p>The greatest flaw of the Three Primordial Solar Beast was that it was slow. Qing Shui formed imprints with his hands.</p>
 <p>Buddha Form Reveal!</p>
 <p>Buddha's True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>Monstrous Wave!</p>
 <p>Water contradicts fire!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he should be able to confine it like this.</p>
 <p>In the ocean, the Three Primordial Solar Beast was like a unique existence, darting around and even the Tidal Cloud Waves Seal was only able to stop to for a short moment.</p>
 <p>Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Confinement!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui performed the Seventh Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm again, the lotus form with an even greater prowess. It managed to confine the Three Primordial Solar Beast!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then shifted the sword to his left hand and swung it once again!</p>
 <p>Another Seventh Waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Single-handedly holding up the skies!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>This time around, what Qing Shui unleashed was the attacking prowess of the Seventh Waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>The tremendous strength slapping down on the Three Primordial Solar Beast caused it to bleed profusely and many aspects on its scale armor were smashed!</p>
 <p>The prowess of this attack was concentrated with all of Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique's spirit energy. How powerful was that? It caused the Three Primordial Solar Beast to be seriously injured and this was when Qing Shui didn't get the 20% chance of having the attacking prowess doubled. Otherwise, it would probably have died.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange was stunned. What kind of power was this? If this attack were to land on him, how could he block?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was in no rush to attack again. He was waiting for Tian Jiange to express his stance!</p>
 <p>"I've lost!"</p>
 <p>After very long, Tian Jiange let out a soft sigh, wearing an unconcealable bitterness on his face.</p>
 <p>"There's nothing wrong about losing. It's something that every cultivator is constantly experiencing. It's just that there are many means to admitting defeat. Even if you lose, don't lose in terms of morale; even if you lose, don't lose in terms of spirit; even if you lose, don't lose in terms of will..." Qing Shui spoke calmly.</p>
 <p>There was a difference between between "I've lost" and "I admit defeat"!</p>
 <p>What Tian Jiange said was "I've lost" and not "I admit defeat"!</p>
 <p>"I wonder if you're able to accept the words I'd said earlier?" Tian Jiange said softly.</p>
 <p>"Friends are made with the heart. If you treat me as a friend, I'll naturally treat you the same." Qing Shui smiled and said calmly.</p>
 <p>"Alright, I'll treat you as a friend. I have a feeling that we'll meet again. The next time we meet, we'll be friends. Farewell!" Tian Jiange cupped his fists together toward Qing Shui, called back the seriously injured Three Primordial Solar Beast and then turned to leave.</p>
 <p>[1] The Chinese characters for Tian Jiange’s “Tian Jian” is the same as the characters for “Sky Sword”.</p>
