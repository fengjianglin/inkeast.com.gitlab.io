She'll also be able to see your children grow up and settle down with their jobs and families. I'm a physician. Trust me."&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn't say any more words of appreciations. Even an honest man like himself knew that it was too hypocritical to be saying thanks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would remember Qing Shui's kindness and if he were to ever give up his own life for Qing Shui, he would do so without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui made arrangements for Big Tiger and his mother. Big Tiger's mother wasn't that old, but due to her illness, in addition to that they were poor and lived a tough life, she appeared a lot older than other people of her age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui help treated her illness, she looked a lot more energized after a change of clothes. After all, she wasn't even 50 years old and in this world, where there was an abundance of spiritual Qi, people in their 50s would appear very young. This wasn't just applicable to cultivators, but to ordinary people as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, Qing Shui had managed to heal her vitality. She would now become increasingly younger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After settling Big Tiger down, Qing Shui recalled that he had not been studying the Treasure Basin. He had forgotten about it as some things popped up and unknowingly, two days had passed by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out the Treasure Basin and studied it carefully. In order to activate it, through letting it recognize him as its owner, 15 drops of blood essence were required. However, there were three drops in the middle of the process which required being filled in by half the amount of one drop of blood, and then having to wait for an interval of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui had completed the process, the Treasure Basin emitted a brilliant golden light and the ingots images gleamed in the golden light. The Treasure Basin extruded a luxurious and dignified aura, giving off an extravagant feeling of perfection, which made even Qing Shui interested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within a single moment, the Treasure Basin became big. It could become very big. Qing Shui then checked out the Treasure Basin's details. It was currently still at a very low level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Treasure Basin wasn't an attack-based treasure. Instead, its main effect was to gather treasure. However, it wasn't something which could gather silver and gold by itself. If it were indeed so and this thing were to exist in his previous life, it would be extremely valuable. However, to the current Qing Shui, gathering silver and gold was pretty meaningless to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most important aspect of the Treasure Basin was to gather treasure, not money. The description of Treasure Basins in Qing Shui's previous life was too superficial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's Treasure Basin had two uses. The first was to gather Qi. It could allow some things to nurture and be nourished within the Treasure Basin. For example, some medicinal pills could receive an increase in their effects. Spices could become more fragrant and ores could become higher in quality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other thing was that it could be used to merge treasures. It could merge two completely different things together. The item that was more powerful would engulf the weaker one's essence, allowing its quality and other aspects to become higher. There was a certain chance that there would be a metamorphosis and something new would be created. The new item would have the attributes of the items it was made of as a foundation. For example, metal could absorb some other things to become Tempered Meteoric Iron. It could undergo metamorphosis and become a few levels higher in quality, but would not become something mystical that was completely irrelevant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, there would be exceptions. The weaker of the two items might have that particular attribute. It might be weaker but was purer, and as such, even after the metamorphosis, the weaker item could possibly have its attributes merged into the new treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very satisfied with the Treasure Basin. This was definitely a precious treasure. As its level increased, it should become even more powerful. Qing Shui expanded the Treasure Basin and put in a lot of things. He didn't activate its ability to merge items and thus the things inside wouldn't engulf each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had put in quite a number of medicinal pills and things like that to increase their quality. Fate Fruit, Ancient Demonic Fruit, Fortune Golden Pellet, Xiantian Golden Pellet... This Treasure Basin could expand to a length, width, and height of ten meters and many precious things could be placed inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Treasure Basin's level increased, this Treasure Basin should be able to expand even more. Currently, it was only at level one and Qing Shui noticed that it could increase an item's quality by 10%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">10% might not seem to be a lot, but it was definitely a worthy amount. After all, this was the lowest level and in the future, its level would increase a lot. Increasing an item's quality was sometimes better than increasing its quantity. Ultimately, there were things which each person could only take one of. In such situations, the higher the quality, the better it would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the effect would be even more amazing if it could increase the quantity of the item. There were things which were unique and during times like this and being able to increase the quantity was definitely heaven-defying. Qing Shui had no idea if the Treasure Basin could gain such an effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui placed in a lot of stuff, including treasures and materials for forging the flying sword inside to increase their abilities. At the current level, the Treasure Basin could increase their quality by 10% after one month. This time was neither considered long nor short in the outside world, but it was definitely not considered long in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would temper with the Treasure Basin daily using his blood essence as he did with the Five Elements Divine Flags. Therefore, after 100 days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, or less than one night in the outside world, the Treasure Basin had reached level 2 and was halfway to the next level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first three levels were the easiest to achieve. The level 2 Treasure Basin didn't have many changes but its ability to gather Qi could increase the items' quality by 20%. The quality of the merged treasure would also be 10% better than the items it was merged from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the next day, Qing Shui came out and opened the Imperial Cuisine Hall for business. Qing Shui was also very busy at the moment. Big Tiger was very hardworking and tried to learn the basic things required for medical treatment. Qing Shui had used medicinal pills to change Big Tiger and at the very least, he now had a much better memory than ordinary people. However, there was no way to change his character and he was still his honest self. This was also a likable character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't teach him anything else for now. He was unlike Qing Ci, who had a great foundation. He still needed more time. Still, Qing Shui had already recruited several physicians. He'd be very busy otherwise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had looked for many physicians and then picked out four from there. The most important characteristic of a physician was their moral. This was something which Qing Shui valued the most. If a person didn't have good morals, it'd be useless no matter how much they had learned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't have to concern himself with the Jade Fragrant Restaurant as Yu Xixuan was very free after distributing the work to her employees. However, she would sort out the gathered information every day for ease of search. If they were to acquire any important information, she would tell Qing Shui immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a photographic memory and would basically not forget stuff after hearing or seeing it once. It wasn't a rare thing for cultivators to be able to remember things from just one glance. This was especially so for geniuses. A good memory skill was a necessity for them and they would also require good logical and learning abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he stepped out of the door, he saw someone walking over. Qing Shui was stunned. He saw a woman, one whom he recognized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a slender figure, like a fairy who had descended from the vast starry skies. Her aura was graceful. Dignified wasn't enough to be used to describe her. Her eyes were like the bright moon in the sky, pure yet deep, impressive and intelligent-looking to the extent that it was hard for one to look at her in the eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wore white clothes with an image of a snow-white Divine Phoenix, but emitted strong power and gave off an intense aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unsurpassed beauty of a generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This didn't just describe her looks, but also everything about her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her unparalleled appearance had made many men hard to have tainted thoughts toward her.
