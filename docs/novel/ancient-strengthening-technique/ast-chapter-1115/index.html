 <p><strong>AST 1115 - Beitang Clan’s Final Trump Card (1)</strong></p>
 <p>In just a short while, almost half of the people from Beitang Clan had been wiped out. They were all the main clan members of Beitang Clan. There were about a thousand of them. Furthermore, they were all elites and the backbone supporting Beitang Clan. However, the bloodline that Beitang Clan had put in so much effort to nurture, was now suffering the fate of being massacred.</p>
 <p>Right now, Beitang Clan felt as if their hearts were bleeding out blood. Maybe the scene now would remind them of the scene back then when they exterminated Yiye Clan. It looked so similar to the scene now.</p>
 <p>Back in those days, Yiye Clan was once also a huge clan. At the very least, it wouldn’t be any inferior to Beitang Clan in terms of the amount of clan members they had in their clan. However, they had to suffer the fate of being mercilessly killed by Beitang Clan and in the end, left behind only a pair of children running away for their lives. Today, the people who once suffered at that time were back to demand their repayment. Naturally, Beitang Clan would have to exchange blood for blood.</p>
 <p>Including Beitang Yingji, there were only about ten people within the formation. The people outside on the other hand, were being mercilessly slaughtered.</p>
 <p>“Beitang Yingji, all of the things which happened back then were all your doings and yet you’re right here huddled up like a turtle with both its arms and legs drawn in. Are you not our brother? Are you just going to sit still and watch us get killed?” A member of the Beitang Clan shouted as he was trying to escape.</p>
 <p>“Of course, I wasn’t involved in the incident back then, why should I die in your place?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>These were all people from Beitang Clan, it was just that because they all had long lifespans, it helped the population in the clan thrive and flourish. From an outsider’s point of view, they might be people who came from the same clan but deep down, the relationship between people of their own blood had long since become really distant from each other. But when all was said and done, they still shared the same blood, they were all people from the well-regarded Beitang Clan.</p>
 <p>But that was all in the past. Now, under the circumstance where everyone was pushed back into a corner to such an extent, a lot of people were annoyed with the turtling Beitang Yingji and the people who holed up along with him. Those people were all clan members directly related to him, they were all the backbones supporting him in the clan.</p>
 <p>Right now, Yin Clan’s Head had his brows knitted very tightly. After that, he glanced towards Yinyue Clan’s Head. He didn’t actually say anything. He just looked at him in silence. He seemed confused, it was as if he was waiting for Yinyue Clan Head’s response.</p>
 <p>Yinyue Clan’s Head got distracted for a while. After that, he slowly nodded his head and shouted loudly along with Yin Clan’s Head almost at the same time: “Everyone from Lion King’s Ridge, stop every single one of the Beitang Clan who is attempting to run away from the battlefield! If they resist, kill them!”</p>
 <p>Everything happened so suddenly. Despite this, the people from Lion King’s Ridge who were initially gathering around the battlefield had all begun to go after the people from Beitang Clan. Qing Shui was not surprised seeing such scene. In fact, things would be better this way, if not, some of them would have most likely managed to get away. After all, there were so many people, if they were to take off their Lion King’s Ridge attire and hide themselves among the crowd, it would be impossible to search for them.</p>
 <p>“Yin Lang, Yinyue Hu, you two actually dare betray Beitang Clan, you two will definitely suffer a tragic death! Just watch, it won’t be long before it happens!” Beitang Yingji shouted loudly.</p>
 <p>“Haha, betrayal? Since when have I betrayed Beitang Clan? Since when have we been Beitang Clan’s slaves? We have always been people from Lion King’s Ridge and have never had anything to do with you Beitang Clan. What a joke.” Yin clan’s head said in a disdainful tone.</p>
 <p>“There is a reason to why things ended up like this for Beitang Clan. Beitang Clan has already run out of luck, there’s no need for anymore struggle,” Yinyue Hu said calmly.</p>
 <p>“Do you guys seriously think that Beitang Clan will be destroyed? Just you guys wait, you will find out really soon, get ready to suffer from Beitang Clan’s rage! Oh and also, there are still people from Beitang Clan who will avenge us. Hahaha……”</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about the other Lion King Devil Slaying Squad? Unfortunately, they left way earlier than you guys.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, a group of people stepped out. Each of them had Violet Dragon Jade Pendant attached to their waist. When Qing Shui saw it, he smiled. These were people from Violet Dragon Mountain. To think that people from Violet Dragon Mountain would cause such effect in this kind of situation.</p>
 <p>“Ah, Zilong Shi you…. You… Why would you guys do this?” Beitang Yingji was so angry he sounded like he was trembling as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Why would I do that? Ask your dead son, he actually killed my grandson because of a woman. It seems to me that you Beitang Clan are just asking for your own death,” Zilong Shi said angrily.</p>
 <p>“You dotard, my son and the others were all killed by this little bastard. What makes you think that my son was the one who killed your grandson? It was all this little bastard’s doing,” Beitang Yingji yelled in rage.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I’m not being a dotard, Mister Qing dared to kill people from Violet Dragon Mountain right in front of me, do you think that he wouldn’t dare to admit that he killed my own grandson? Your son on the other hand, he took advantage of the fact he was stronger than my grandson and bullied him countless times. This time, he even killed him for a woman in the Ancient Ruins.”</p>
 <p>Even Beitang Yingji himself did not have a clear idea about it. He did not even know if anyone saw it. Violet Dragon Mountain had already eliminated the last few of the squads from Beitang Clan. This made him feel as if he had fallen into a deep abyss all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>Zilong Shi wasn’t sure if it was Beitang Yingji’s son who killed his own grandson. But now, he could only grind his teeth and say it. Furthermore, there were witnesses to it. This young man with surname Qing was just too terrifying. He did not want Violet Dragon Mountain to end up like Beitang Clan.</p>
 <p>There were no friends who would last forever, nor would there be such enemies. Let alone Violet Dragon Mountain had never had any disputes with him. It was already good enough if they could get a friend in exchange for the life of his grandson. Let alone at that time, the young man had looked steady. For someone at his age, he was definitely capable of telling that his grandson didn’t die by Qing Shui’s hand. A person would act differently when they were telling the truth and when they’re telling lies. No matter how calm they acted, there would still be some flaws in the way they spoke.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch, Patriarch, I know you’re nearby. Beitang Clan is almost dead, do you still not want to come out?” At this moment, Beitang Yingji hollered out into the sky.</p>
 <p>Everyone was startled. There were still some people who were aware that Beitang Clan had a very old elder. He had long since disconnected himself from the world, so much so that no one was aware of his cultivation.</p>
 <p>“Hai!”</p>
 <p>A depressing sigh was heard. No one knew where it came from. However, everyone felt as if they just got punched in the chest, it felt stuffy.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch, Patriarch, these people are planning to destroy Beitang Clan, Beitang Clan is done for.” Now, Beitang Yingji no longer carried the usual impressive aura that he always had with him. He was more like a stray dog, a coward who was begging for pity.</p>
 <p>When a warrior walked up to this point, he was basically considered to already be dead. He had already lost his heart as a warrior.</p>
 <p>A figure appeared from the distance. It was an old man with his back hunched. He was leaning on a walking stick that looked like a dead tree. He might seem like he was casually walking in the air, his speed was as swift as a meteor.</p>
 <p>When one met the old man on the ground, they would think that he was just a normal old man past his prime. But now, no one dared to look down on him despite his ordinary appearance.</p>
 <p>The old man looked really normal. Both his eyes looked nasty and he had deep wrinkles all over his face. Qing Shui could already tell with his Spiritual Sense that the old man didn’t have long to live. Despite his formidable cultivation, he still wouldn’t last for as long as ten years.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised when he was unable to sense the old man’s cultivation. There were only two reasons for this, it was either that the old man was unpredictable or that the old man had special tricks to cover up his strength and aura.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the old man was already in front of Beitang Yingji. He lifted up his cloudy eyes and looked towards Qing Shui. After that, he looked around. His eyes resembled that of a dead fish. At the time when he was observing the people around, his eyeballs seemed like they were all white.</p>
 <p>When one ran into such an old man, they would think that they had just run into a ghost. Qing Shui had a sensitive spiritual sense. He was capable of sensing the gloomy aura that the old man was emitting.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch, Patriarch, it’s them and also, Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan have also turned on us. Kill them. I want them dead,” Beitang Yingji withdrew his formation and shouted in rage.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>A sharp and clear noise of a slap was heard: “Look at you now, do you still think that you haven’t embarrassed us enough? Even with your age, I have no idea how you ended up being the clan head of Beitang Clan. Are there really no other suitable candidates anymore?”</p>
 <p>“Patriarch……”</p>
 <p>Beitang Yingji stunned in shock.</p>
 <p>“It isn’t surprising for Beitang Clan to suffer what they’re suffering now. I have already long since predicted it. It’s just that I didn’t expect it to be this early. I still have ten years of life left. Originally, I thought that I would be able to die a peaceful death but it looks like this is going to be tough. In the future, Beitang Clan will be disconnected from the other four continents.” The old man shook his head. His voice may have sounded a bit husky, there were no fluctuations in his tone. Even when he was beating up the others before, he still sounded calm like water.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch, wouldn’t it be easy for you to kill them? With you around, Beitang Clan will be able to get back on its feet very quickly.” Beitang Yingji’s mind was already in chaos. He was reluctant to let go of the position as both the clan’s head as well as the leader of Lion King’s Ridge.</p>
 <p>“You are no longer fit to be someone from Beitang Clan. Beitang Clan has been destroyed in your hands.” The old man immediately thrust his wooden stick towards Beitang Yingji’s chest.</p>
 <p>Beitang Yingji spat out blood and flew backwards. He was on his last breath.</p>
 <p>”</p>
 <p>Beitang Yingji landed right in front of Qing Shui and the group. At this moment, the old man’s voice was heard: “Kill him, treat it as finding justice for Yiye Clan. I wonder if we can finally settle the hatred we have shared for so many years.”</p>
 <p>All of this happened so suddenly and so unexpectedly. When Qing Shui saw Beitang Yingji who was at his last gasp, he knew that he could no longer be saved. He immediately picked him up with his leg and tossed him back to the old man.</p>
 <p>“I want the life of everyone from Beitang Clan,” Qing Shui said softly looking at the old man.</p>
 <p>“Young man, do you want the Beitang clan members across the other four continents to die as well?” The old man looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I only want whoever’s here from Beitang Clan to disappear.” Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, if that is so. In any case, things have already long been decided. Well then, allow me to join in and toy around with you guys for a while.” At the moment when the old man was speaking, he seemed to have slightly straightened his back.</p>
 <p>“I will kill a few of the people here who deserve to die to make you familiar with my cultivation. Or else, it would have been unfair for you.” The old man’s silhouette disappeared in a flash.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui calmly asked the girls to go into the formation. He was sensing the old man’s step effects. Surprisingly, it was similar to the Seven Star Steps. They were similar even in terms of how mystical they were.</p>
 <p>“This is the Great Emptiness Step!’</p>
 <p>“I hate traitors the most. I hate those who take advantage of people’s danger and use the situation in their own favor. I will treat killing a few of you as a warm-up.” The old man moved towards Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan swiftly.</p>
 <p>Both Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan’s facial expressions changed drastically. They felt deep regret in their hearts. Previously, they were trying to flatter Qing Shui. Their intention was to take control and be the foundation of Lion King’s Ridge. But now, everything happened too suddenly, for a moment, their facial expressions went through a 360 degree change. They knew that the old man might be planning to take Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan along.</p>
 <p>“Stop him……”</p>
 <p>A few of the old men from both clans worked together to ambush the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man swung the crutch in his hand, which resembled a dead tree. As he did so, a cloud of black smoke condensed into an enormous black monster and charged towards those elderly men. A thick bloody smell started spreading around the area. The smell immediately caused nauseousness. It did not matter if they did not breathe it in. It was as if it was penetrating through the body from the pores.</p>
 <p>“Ah, it’s poisonous……”</p>
 <p>……</p>
