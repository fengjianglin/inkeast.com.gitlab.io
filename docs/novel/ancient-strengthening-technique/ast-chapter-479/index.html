 <p><strong>Chapter 479 The breakthrough of the 180th Cycle of Circulate Qi, Can I take care of you forever? .</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 479 The breakthrough of the 180th Cycle of Circulate Qi, Can I take care of you forever?</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had a moody look on her face. Her beautiful and pure eyes were still indifferent as usual. She looked at him with her pink-colored lips pursed tightly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was surprised when she saw that Qing Shui had regained his consciousness. Moreover, he was holding hands of Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li. When they noticed Mo Yayan was looking at them, the ladies quickly took back their hands in embarrassment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yayan, you are here.” Huoyun Liu-Li grinned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I hope I didn’t disturb you all!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, no….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Chang and Grandpa Fei are here!” As soon as Mo Yayan finished her sentence, Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji were already walking into the room. They were amazed that Qing Shui has regained his consciousness. Both of them laughed relievedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, this is good news!” Cang Wuya teared a bit when he saw Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was touched knowing Cang Wuya was worried for him. Cang Wuya had experienced a lot of things in life, but when he developed a sense of attachment to Qing Shui, he had already developed a deep bond with him - he had already treated him as his own descendant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am sorry that I made you worried!” Qing Shui smiled as he greeted Cang Wuya.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“As long as you are awake, everything is fine. You have to thank lil’ Mo properly. She saved your life,” chuckled Cang Wuya.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s not my doing. If the Old Ancestor didn’t help me, I don’t think I would have been able to heal you back,” Mo Yayan laughed in a crisp tone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, Old Ancestor helped prolong your life. He also said that you would have definitely died if that sword had struck every part of your body. You sure are lucky.” Mo Yayan said casually.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he barely escape death because of the “Minute Subtlety” effect, which was able to analyze the sword’s formidable power. Since he wasn’t able to evade the incoming attack, the “Minute Subtlety” was also able to decrease the damage intake to the lowest degree.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At least he was able to stay alive!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So I slept for seven days straight?” Qing Shui frowned as he asked Mo Yayan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You did not ‘sleep’ for seven days, you fainted for seven days.” Mo Yayan was apparently in a bad mood as she corrected Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose with his right hand as he pondered what had happened to his body for the past seven days. He examined his own body thoroughly and found that his Ancient Strengthening Technique had healed the injuries inflicted in his inner organs, especially the critical wounds on his heart. Moreover, Qing Shui was also able to recover at a fast pace after seeing the mystical Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness in addition to the tonics provided by Mo Yayan. However, it would take some more time for Qing Shui to fully recover his health.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But since he has regained his consciousness, it would not be a problem to make a full recovery. All he needed to do was to intensify the activation of his Ancient Strengthening Technique and constantly warm up his body. After all, he was his best doctor; it was easy for him to nurse his own conditions.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You must be hungry. Let me get something for you.” Canghai Mingyue stood up and went to get some food for Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, Qing Shui is destined for good fortunes after he had survived that attack. My dear sister has never been so gentle to anyone before. This must be that painful but happy feeling you mentioned.” Huoyun Liu-Li giggled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. He nearly lost his life before this. It was a nice thought having someone being gentle with him, but he still needed to be alive to be able to enjoy that!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Rest well, Qing Shui. Stay here for a few more days if you like!” Cang Wuya smiled at the pale-faced Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old man, I’m fine. Don’t worry, I will recover soon and regain my strength.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, we know. Doctor Mo did say that you have a shocking self-restoration ability that surpasses the rate of demonic beasts.” Fei Wuji said while grinning from ear to ear.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed with him, but he didn’t know whether it was a compliment or an insult.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Rest well!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After instructing Qing Shui to rest well for a few more times, Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji finally left the room!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not thank them because it would be weird to do so. Of course, Mo Yayan would not be an exception; he still had to thank her properly. Mo Yayan was the woman who made him feel delicate and tender.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Ancient Strengthening Technique was still cultivating inside his body, albeit slowly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After one great cycle of Circulate Qi, Qing Shui became dumbfounded by what he discovered!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While he was unconscious, Qing Shui’s Ancient Strengthening Technique had already reached the 180th cycle of Circulate Qi. Right now, however, Qing Shui was still weak and recovering, so he couldn't sense how much power he had gained.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He still couldn't believe that he had surpassed 180 cycles of Circulate Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had always known that it would take a long while to surpass the next cycle after his 179th cycle of Circulate Qi. Although he has faith that he would eventually reach the Peak 5th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, which would also be the 199th cycle of Circulate Qi, he didn't think that he would be able to breakthrough the 180th cycle of Circulate Qi so quickly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was getting excited because this 180th cycle of Circulate Qi was the key that acted as the pathway to the gate of Peak 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique. However, opening the gate would be an entire story altogether.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He did make preparations in these 6 months to open this “gate.” But he wasn't prepared for this surprise at all!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How's the Feng Clan?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only Qing Shui, Canghai Mingyue, and Huoyun Liu-Li were left in the room. Even Mo Yayan knew how to read the mood and slipped away unnoticed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The four Supreme Elders are still alive.” Canghai Mingyue gave Qing Shui a bizarre look.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had already expected them to be alive since he only used the silver needles to subdue their movements temporarily. He didn’t plan to obliterate the entire clan; he wanted to leave a strand of hope so that they could live.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, they would be bullied by many others since they had become a clan with no Peak Martial King warriors. They seemed to be the same as Yan Clan, where internal conflicts existed because of family corruptions. Luckily, there weren’t many who bore grudges against Qing Shui as the remaining survivors had taken control over Feng Clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“They came to see you when you were still unconscious.” Canghai Mingyue said gently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mm!” Qing Shui let out a smile as he gazed at the ladies. He felt a bit relieved and &nbsp;hoped that Feng Clan would manage themselves well from now on. However, they would not be able to regain their former strength as long as Qing Shui was still alive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A woman named Feng Yu came to see you, but she didn’t say anything.” Huoyun Liu-Li kept on staring at Qing Shui while she spoke about Feng Yu.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She’s the prettiest one of the three women you met at Feng Residence.” Huoyun Liu-Li reminded Qing Shui ‘kindly.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mm-hmm!” Qing Shui replied while looking back at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She’s pretty, right!” Huoyun Liu-Li gave a sly squint at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mmm!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While he was replying nonchalantly to Liu-Li, he slipped his hand to her back and touched her buttocks that was sitting on the bed. He grabbed them with the palm of his hand!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah!” Huoyun Liu-Li exclaimed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What happened, Liu-Li?” Canghai Mingyue wasn’t able to see what Qing Shui did, so she looked at Huoyun Liu-Li suspiciously as her face turned slightly red.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I just remembered something.” Huoyun Liu-Li gave a vexed look at Qing Shui. However, she did not move away and allowed Qing Shui to fondle her butt as he pleased. She quivered, as if she felt ants crawling inside her. That tingling sensation was comfortable yet unbearable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What did you remember?” Canghai Mingyue smiled. She saw an abnormal red flush on Liu-Li’s cheeks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I forgot to wash my face today….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hand was completely buried in Liu-Li’s soft and bouncy buttocks. He enjoyed this wonderful feeling that he hadn’t felt for so long. He touched, pinched, grabbed, fondled, rubbed, poked…. Anything he could thought of, he squeezed them to his heart’s content.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was absent-mindedly talking to Canghai Mingyue since she could not focus on the conversation. She felt embarrassed getting up now when Qing Shui was already in the midst of fondling her buttocks. Since she didn’t get up when she had the chance, she found it difficult to get up without feeling embarrassed. Moreover, she didn’t feel like getting up anytime soon….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Eat something first. Otherwise, the food will turn cold.” Canghai Mingyue brought the bowl of Lotus Seed Sweet Soup she had prepared for Qing Shui. As she came closer to him, she caught a glimpse of Qing Shui’s hand buried into Huoyun Liu-Li’s buttocks….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, please feed him. I will go wash myself first.” Huoyun Liu-Li blushed as she ran off.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took back his right hand awkwardly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can’t believe you still have the mood even though you are like this.” Canghai Mingyue was also flushed red as she glared at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, I thought I wouldn’t be able to see you two again. I don’t know how else I should express how much I miss you two.” Qing Shui face became hotter. He didn’t feel as ashamed as he thought he would after he had experience a life and death situation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue sat down casually!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She put down the soup on the side table beside the bed. Then she leaned over to Qing Shui and held him up by his neck so she could put a pillow behind his back. While she was standing up adjusting the pillow, Qing Shui embraced her waist with one of his arms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His wounds were not as serious as Canghai Mingyue thought. He could walk slowly and eat with his own hands, but instead, he wanted to enjoy the rare warmth shown by Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, you are still recovering. Yayan said you can’t get too happy or too sad, or become too excited. Please listen to me and let me go.” Canghai Mingyue said nervously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just for a while. I miss you very much.” Qing Shui said softly. His face was plastered on her bosoms while Canghai Mingyue held him by his neck.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had a sweet scent of orchid emanating from her body. Qing Shui hugged her reflexively when he felt the sensation of her soft bouncy bosoms. It wasn’t because of unethical behavior or filthy thoughts in his head, he just wanted to hug her instinctively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue shivered slightly. She held on his neck gently and said: “Stop your foolish thought, otherwise you will never get better.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt comfortable and warm squishing his face on her soft bosoms. Because she only wore a thin layer of clothes due to the warm temperature, Qing Shui was able to see through the shape of her bosoms as well as her perky nipples. So he instinctively went forward and suckled the nipple through her clothes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue trembled violently for a moment. She pushed herself away from Qing Shui calmly while her face was flushed in red. As she glared angrily at Qing Shui, she picked up the steaming hot Lotus Seed Sweet Soup from the table.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You rascal!” After that, she lowered her head!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was itching for more as he continued gazing at her enticing body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Enough, stop looking. Finish this soup first, or else you won’t have the energy to continue your bad behavior...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui almost went crazy hearing those words. He would feel normal if Huoyun Liu-Li was the one saying those things. However, the sisters were always together, so one might have influenced the other and vice versa. This would also explain why she could have said those things unconsciously due to Huoyun Liu-Li’s influence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue seemed more charming with the intense blush on her face. Her mystifying eyes were also trying to evade Qing Shui’s gazes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quietly drank the Lotus Seed Sweet Soup served by Canghai Mingyue one spoon at a time!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just wait for me, I will feed you like this too in the future, alright?” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue stared at Qing Shui for a few moments, then continued to feed the last spoonful of soup into his mouth. The corners of her mouth arched upwards slightly. It was subtle and mesmerizing at the same time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course I will wait for you!” Canghai Mingyue giggled sweetly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about everything he had done for Canghai Mingyue when he saw her happy expression. If he still has doubts about Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li’s love for him, then Qing Shui would be better off dead by crashing into a wall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can I take care of you forever?” Qing Shui asked in a gentle voice after he drank the last spoonful of soup.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was clearly surprised by the question. Her shivering was more evident than when she was hugged by Qing Shui. She gazed at Qing Shui quietly, even though she had panicked for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You know, I really like you….” Qing Shui rubbed his head goofily as he said that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Pffttt!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue laughed. Qing Shui was mesmerized by her beautiful laughter.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Which part of me do you like?” Canghai Mingyue put down the bowl gently and smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know. I just feel happy to be able to see you. I want to get close to you, and I don’t want to see you being sad. I like your expression when you look at me. I will miss you when I can’t see you often. Sometimes I miss the times when we did things together. I want to tell you good things and share everything with you. I like seeing your happy expression...” Qing Shui was trying his best to describe his feelings.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue listened to every word Qing Shui said. She showed an intoxicating smile on her face because of the words she had yearned to hear all her life. Those words felt real, more real than conventional praises.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“And I like how beautiful you are. You are the kind of ‘beautiful’ I love very much….” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Take care of recovering your wounds. Now is not the time for nonsense. You have to preserve a tranquil mindset!” Canghai Mingyue stood up and caressed Qing Shui’s head. Then she took the empty bowl and left the room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was still in a daze. He smiled while watching her leaving the room. He couldn’t quite understand how a woman could change so much - from a person with a cold attitude to a woman with a loving heart.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was alone in the room. He couldn’t help but think about the incident at Feng Residence. It made him feel quite emotional after he hung on the thread of life and death.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He didn’t think that someone would be able to master the terrifying “Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow” technique that used the user’s lifespan to deal tremendous damage. Although the technique was powerful, one would need to make a big sacrifice to use its power.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If I didn’t enter the realm of Minute Subtlety, I would surely have died there and then.” Qing Shui was scared the more he thought about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Being cunning was an advantage. One would be able to reveal their extraordinary capability under certain circumstances!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After activating another cycle of Cultivate Qi, Qing Shui eventually got up from the bed. The wounds on his body didn’t seem as serious as before, but he still has to wear thick bandages around his chest. There weren’t any bloodstains on the bandage, which meant that the frequent application of medicine had healed his external wounds.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly unwrapped his bandage. He noticed his wounds had indeed healed up. However, the injury left a sinister-looking scar on his chest. Qing Shui knew the scars would eventually fade if he continued to activate Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He got dressed and was ready to go outside!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you up?!” Huoyun Liu-Li quickly ran over after she saw Qing Shui all dressed-up and not in his bed where he was supposed to be. She had just washed and came to check on Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am fine. I just want to go relieve myself!” Qing Shui forced a smile to Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Go lie down, there are other ways to relieve yourself, you know…....” Huoyun Liu-Li blushed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am fine, really. I will prove it to you now.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How do you intend to prove that?” Huoyun Liu-Li was skeptical.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 479 The breakthrough of the 180th Cycle of Circulate Qi, Can I take care of you forever?</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had a moody look on her face. Her beautiful and pure eyes were still indifferent as usual. She looked at him with her pink-colored lips pursed tightly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was surprised when she saw that Qing Shui had regained his consciousness. Moreover, he was holding hands of Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li. When they noticed Mo Yayan was looking at them, the ladies quickly took back their hands in embarrassment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yayan, you are here.” Huoyun Liu-Li grinned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I hope I didn’t disturb you all!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, no….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Chang and Grandpa Fei are here!” As soon as Mo Yayan finished her sentence, Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji were already walking into the room. They were amazed that Qing Shui has regained his consciousness. Both of them laughed relievedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, this is good news!” Cang Wuya teared a bit when he saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was touched knowing Cang Wuya was worried for him. Cang Wuya had experienced a lot of things in life, but when he developed a sense of attachment to Qing Shui, he had already developed a deep bond with him - he had already treated him as his own descendant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am sorry that I made you worried!” Qing Shui smiled as he greeted Cang Wuya.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“As long as you are awake, everything is fine. You have to thank lil’ Mo properly. She saved your life,” chuckled Cang Wuya.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s not my doing. If the Old Ancestor didn’t help me, I don’t think I would have been able to heal you back,” Mo Yayan laughed in a crisp tone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, Old Ancestor helped prolong your life. He also said that you would have definitely died if that sword had struck every part of your body. You sure are lucky.” Mo Yayan said casually.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he barely escape death because of the “Minute Subtlety” effect, which was able to analyze the sword’s formidable power. Since he wasn’t able to evade the incoming attack, the “Minute Subtlety” was also able to decrease the damage intake to the lowest degree.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At least he was able to stay alive!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So I slept for seven days straight?” Qing Shui frowned as he asked Mo Yayan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You did not ‘sleep’ for seven days, you fainted for seven days.” Mo Yayan was apparently in a bad mood as she corrected Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose with his right hand as he pondered what had happened to his body for the past seven days. He examined his own body thoroughly and found that his Ancient Strengthening Technique had healed the injuries inflicted in his inner organs, especially the critical wounds on his heart. Moreover, Qing Shui was also able to recover at a fast pace after seeing the mystical Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness in addition to the tonics provided by Mo Yayan. However, it would take some more time for Qing Shui to fully recover his health.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But since he has regained his consciousness, it would not be a problem to make a full recovery. All he needed to do was to intensify the activation of his Ancient Strengthening Technique and constantly warm up his body. After all, he was his best doctor; it was easy for him to nurse his own conditions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You must be hungry. Let me get something for you.” Canghai Mingyue stood up and went to get some food for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, Qing Shui is destined for good fortunes after he had survived that attack. My dear sister has never been so gentle to anyone before. This must be that painful but happy feeling you mentioned.” Huoyun Liu-Li giggled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. He nearly lost his life before this. It was a nice thought having someone being gentle with him, but he still needed to be alive to be able to enjoy that!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Rest well, Qing Shui. Stay here for a few more days if you like!” Cang Wuya smiled at the pale-faced Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old man, I’m fine. Don’t worry, I will recover soon and regain my strength.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, we know. Doctor Mo did say that you have a shocking self-restoration ability that surpasses the rate of demonic beasts.” Fei Wuji said while grinning from ear to ear.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed with him, but he didn’t know whether it was a compliment or an insult.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Rest well!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After instructing Qing Shui to rest well for a few more times, Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji finally left the room!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not thank them because it would be weird to do so. Of course, Mo Yayan would not be an exception; he still had to thank her properly. Mo Yayan was the woman who made him feel delicate and tender.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Ancient Strengthening Technique was still cultivating inside his body, albeit slowly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After one great cycle of Circulate Qi, Qing Shui became dumbfounded by what he discovered!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While he was unconscious, Qing Shui’s Ancient Strengthening Technique had already reached the 180th cycle of Circulate Qi. Right now, however, Qing Shui was still weak and recovering, so he couldn't sense how much power he had gained.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He still couldn't believe that he had surpassed 180 cycles of Circulate Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had always known that it would take a long while to surpass the next cycle after his 179th cycle of Circulate Qi. Although he has faith that he would eventually reach the Peak 5th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, which would also be the 199th cycle of Circulate Qi, he didn't think that he would be able to breakthrough the 180th cycle of Circulate Qi so quickly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was getting excited because this 180th cycle of Circulate Qi was the key that acted as the pathway to the gate of Peak 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique. However, opening the gate would be an entire story altogether.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He did make preparations in these 6 months to open this “gate.” But he wasn't prepared for this surprise at all!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How's the Feng Clan?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only Qing Shui, Canghai Mingyue, and Huoyun Liu-Li were left in the room. Even Mo Yayan knew how to read the mood and slipped away unnoticed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The four Supreme Elders are still alive.” Canghai Mingyue gave Qing Shui a bizarre look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had already expected them to be alive since he only used the silver needles to subdue their movements temporarily. He didn’t plan to obliterate the entire clan; he wanted to leave a strand of hope so that they could live.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, they would be bullied by many others since they had become a clan with no Peak Martial King warriors. They seemed to be the same as Yan Clan, where internal conflicts existed because of family corruptions. Luckily, there weren’t many who bore grudges against Qing Shui as the remaining survivors had taken control over Feng Clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“They came to see you when you were still unconscious.” Canghai Mingyue said gently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mm!” Qing Shui let out a smile as he gazed at the ladies. He felt a bit relieved and &nbsp;hoped that Feng Clan would manage themselves well from now on. However, they would not be able to regain their former strength as long as Qing Shui was still alive.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A woman named Feng Yu came to see you, but she didn’t say anything.” Huoyun Liu-Li kept on staring at Qing Shui while she spoke about Feng Yu.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“She’s the prettiest one of the three women you met at Feng Residence.” Huoyun Liu-Li reminded Qing Shui ‘kindly.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mm-hmm!” Qing Shui replied while looking back at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“She’s pretty, right!” Huoyun Liu-Li gave a sly squint at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mmm!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While he was replying nonchalantly to Liu-Li, he slipped his hand to her back and touched her buttocks that was sitting on the bed. He grabbed them with the palm of his hand!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah!” Huoyun Liu-Li exclaimed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What happened, Liu-Li?” Canghai Mingyue wasn’t able to see what Qing Shui did, so she looked at Huoyun Liu-Li suspiciously as her face turned slightly red.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I just remembered something.” Huoyun Liu-Li gave a vexed look at Qing Shui. However, she did not move away and allowed Qing Shui to fondle her butt as he pleased. She quivered, as if she felt ants crawling inside her. That tingling sensation was comfortable yet unbearable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What did you remember?” Canghai Mingyue smiled. She saw an abnormal red flush on Liu-Li’s cheeks.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I forgot to wash my face today….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hand was completely buried in Liu-Li’s soft and bouncy buttocks. He enjoyed this wonderful feeling that he hadn’t felt for so long. He touched, pinched, grabbed, fondled, rubbed, poked…. Anything he could thought of, he squeezed them to his heart’s content.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was absent-mindedly talking to Canghai Mingyue since she could not focus on the conversation. She felt embarrassed getting up now when Qing Shui was already in the midst of fondling her buttocks. Since she didn’t get up when she had the chance, she found it difficult to get up without feeling embarrassed. Moreover, she didn’t feel like getting up anytime soon….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Eat something first. Otherwise, the food will turn cold.” Canghai Mingyue brought the bowl of Lotus Seed Sweet Soup she had prepared for Qing Shui. As she came closer to him, she caught a glimpse of Qing Shui’s hand buried into Huoyun Liu-Li’s buttocks….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, please feed him. I will go wash myself first.” Huoyun Liu-Li blushed as she ran off.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took back his right hand awkwardly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can’t believe you still have the mood even though you are like this.” Canghai Mingyue was also flushed red as she glared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Well, I thought I wouldn’t be able to see you two again. I don’t know how else I should express how much I miss you two.” Qing Shui face became hotter. He didn’t feel as ashamed as he thought he would after he had experience a life and death situation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue sat down casually!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She put down the soup on the side table beside the bed. Then she leaned over to Qing Shui and held him up by his neck so she could put a pillow behind his back. While she was standing up adjusting the pillow, Qing Shui embraced her waist with one of his arms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His wounds were not as serious as Canghai Mingyue thought. He could walk slowly and eat with his own hands, but instead, he wanted to enjoy the rare warmth shown by Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, you are still recovering. Yayan said you can’t get too happy or too sad, or become too excited. Please listen to me and let me go.” Canghai Mingyue said nervously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just for a while. I miss you very much.” Qing Shui said softly. His face was plastered on her bosoms while Canghai Mingyue held him by his neck.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had a sweet scent of orchid emanating from her body. Qing Shui hugged her reflexively when he felt the sensation of her soft bouncy bosoms. It wasn’t because of unethical behavior or filthy thoughts in his head, he just wanted to hug her instinctively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue shivered slightly. She held on his neck gently and said: “Stop your foolish thought, otherwise you will never get better.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt comfortable and warm squishing his face on her soft bosoms. Because she only wore a thin layer of clothes due to the warm temperature, Qing Shui was able to see through the shape of her bosoms as well as her perky nipples. So he instinctively went forward and suckled the nipple through her clothes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue trembled violently for a moment. She pushed herself away from Qing Shui calmly while her face was flushed in red. As she glared angrily at Qing Shui, she picked up the steaming hot Lotus Seed Sweet Soup from the table.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You rascal!” After that, she lowered her head!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was itching for more as he continued gazing at her enticing body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Enough, stop looking. Finish this soup first, or else you won’t have the energy to continue your bad behavior...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui almost went crazy hearing those words. He would feel normal if Huoyun Liu-Li was the one saying those things. However, the sisters were always together, so one might have influenced the other and vice versa. This would also explain why she could have said those things unconsciously due to Huoyun Liu-Li’s influence.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue seemed more charming with the intense blush on her face. Her mystifying eyes were also trying to evade Qing Shui’s gazes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quietly drank the Lotus Seed Sweet Soup served by Canghai Mingyue one spoon at a time!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just wait for me, I will feed you like this too in the future, alright?” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue stared at Qing Shui for a few moments, then continued to feed the last spoonful of soup into his mouth. The corners of her mouth arched upwards slightly. It was subtle and mesmerizing at the same time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course I will wait for you!” Canghai Mingyue giggled sweetly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about everything he had done for Canghai Mingyue when he saw her happy expression. If he still has doubts about Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li’s love for him, then Qing Shui would be better off dead by crashing into a wall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can I take care of you forever?” Qing Shui asked in a gentle voice after he drank the last spoonful of soup.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was clearly surprised by the question. Her shivering was more evident than when she was hugged by Qing Shui. She gazed at Qing Shui quietly, even though she had panicked for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You know, I really like you….” Qing Shui rubbed his head goofily as he said that.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Pffttt!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue laughed. Qing Shui was mesmerized by her beautiful laughter.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Which part of me do you like?” Canghai Mingyue put down the bowl gently and smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know. I just feel happy to be able to see you. I want to get close to you, and I don’t want to see you being sad. I like your expression when you look at me. I will miss you when I can’t see you often. Sometimes I miss the times when we did things together. I want to tell you good things and share everything with you. I like seeing your happy expression...” Qing Shui was trying his best to describe his feelings.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue listened to every word Qing Shui said. She showed an intoxicating smile on her face because of the words she had yearned to hear all her life. Those words felt real, more real than conventional praises.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“And I like how beautiful you are. You are the kind of ‘beautiful’ I love very much….” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Take care of recovering your wounds. Now is not the time for nonsense. You have to preserve a tranquil mindset!” Canghai Mingyue stood up and caressed Qing Shui’s head. Then she took the empty bowl and left the room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was still in a daze. He smiled while watching her leaving the room. He couldn’t quite understand how a woman could change so much - from a person with a cold attitude to a woman with a loving heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was alone in the room. He couldn’t help but think about the incident at Feng Residence. It made him feel quite emotional after he hung on the thread of life and death.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He didn’t think that someone would be able to master the terrifying “Enormous Bloody Seal of Sorrow” technique that used the user’s lifespan to deal tremendous damage. Although the technique was powerful, one would need to make a big sacrifice to use its power.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If I didn’t enter the realm of Minute Subtlety, I would surely have died there and then.” Qing Shui was scared the more he thought about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Being cunning was an advantage. One would be able to reveal their extraordinary capability under certain circumstances!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After activating another cycle of Cultivate Qi, Qing Shui eventually got up from the bed. The wounds on his body didn’t seem as serious as before, but he still has to wear thick bandages around his chest. There weren’t any bloodstains on the bandage, which meant that the frequent application of medicine had healed his external wounds.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly unwrapped his bandage. He noticed his wounds had indeed healed up. However, the injury left a sinister-looking scar on his chest. Qing Shui knew the scars would eventually fade if he continued to activate Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He got dressed and was ready to go outside!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you up?!” Huoyun Liu-Li quickly ran over after she saw Qing Shui all dressed-up and not in his bed where he was supposed to be. She had just washed and came to check on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am fine. I just want to go relieve myself!” Qing Shui forced a smile to Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Go lie down, there are other ways to relieve yourself, you know…....” Huoyun Liu-Li blushed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am fine, really. I will prove it to you now.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How do you intend to prove that?” Huoyun Liu-Li was skeptical.</p>
