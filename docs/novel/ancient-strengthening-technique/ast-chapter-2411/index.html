 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2411 - Beating Up Regardless, It Should Be Madam Qing...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at the arrogant young man. He had always felt that people like these were a little moronic. However, there were people like these everywhere. Despite so, this was also a sign of one's background. Only those who were very strong could act so arrogant. At the very least, they must be at the top within a certain area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Qing Shui had also hoped that he was the son of a great clan, being able to do nothing all day long, walking the dog, teasing ladies... It would be even better if he could snatch women for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young man was much alike to many people from Qing Shui's previous life. For example, people who kept flaunting that their father was some important character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wasn't the loser he had been in the past. He was now capable, had more responsibilities, had a lot of beauties around him, and wasn't lacking in money. Therefore, he didn't care to act like this. Moreover, the stronger one becomes, the more they could sense the existence of the Heavenly Dao. It was a formless cycle of cause and effect. The cause you've sown today would give fruit to the effect tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Qing Shui had fallen silent, the young man was elated. He even laughed proudly. "Why, now you are afraid? As long as you can agree to one condition, I can let you guys off."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What condition is that?" Qing Shui was amused. He didn't immediately beat up the guy, but the other party was so foolish that he was thinking so highly of himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I see the few ladies next to you aren't bad. I'll be taking them. I can spare your lives, but you'll need to scram out of the Forsaken Heaven City immediately," said the young man confidently. He felt that he had full control over the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui couldn't be bothered with someone like this and thus wasn't angry. The guy had the right to say anything he wished to, but there was no way that he was going to accept the offer as is. He had to pay the price for what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hao Tian, beat down all of his teeth." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hao Tian had long since wanted to make a move because the women this moronic guy was asking for included Tang Xi as well. Therefore, the moment Qing Shui said this, Hao Tian made a move immediately, smashing a punch onto Wu Dalang's mouth. It was a very straightforward punch and Wu Dalang didn't have a single tooth left in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ahh wuuu wuuu...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Dalang looked at Hao Tian and cried out in pain. He wanted to say something but could only whine while his face was covered in blood and tears; his snot came flowing down. He was in an extremely sorry state. Wu Dalang kept waving his hand. "Kill.... th...em... Ki...ll... them... Ssss..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His shouts were blurred, but others could still understand what he was talking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over 30 people had come, and there were good fighters amongst them. It was just that they were a far cry from Qing Shui and his group. Even if they were from the Nine Continents Martial Association, a profligate son wouldn't be able to bring along powerful followers. It was because even if other people wished to exact revenge, they wouldn't choose to look for a useless person like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, these people were all taken down with serious injuries. Qing Shui didn't really make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill me if you dare. My grandfather will chop you guys into pieces! Just you wait!" Wu Dalang was still challenging them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled. He walked over and squatted down. "Even if your grandfather were to come, he'll just get a beating as well. In order to show you that, I won't kill you today. Oh, right, are you afraid to die?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm a useless piece of crap anyway and ain't afraid to die. It's nothing even if I were to die. I've eaten my fill and had my share of fun." Wu Dalang laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're really carefree, but sometimes, it's better to be dead than to be alive. For example, if I were to cut off your testicles... What would you think about that?" Qing Shui's gaze landed between Wu Dalang's legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Dalang shivered. He had the feeling that Qing Shui wouldn't dare to kill him. He was a profligate son, and profligate sons were actually the ones who enjoyed life the most. He could play with different women every day, indulging in wine and sensual pleasures, or snatch married women...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, I was wrong. I shouldn't have come to look for you. Please let me off. I promise that I won't seek vengeance. I swear, I guarantee," Wu Dalang quickly said. He was scared out of his wits. If he really lost his ‘tool’, it would really be a fate worse than death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Swear that if you were to land in my hands next time, then you'll crush your own testicles." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Dalang quickly swore. Swearing an oath was just a word to him; he didn't believe in something like that. As long as he could get out of this place and get his clan to step in, they would definitely be able to take care of Qing Shui. Otherwise, the Nine Continents Martial Association wouldn't be able to hold their heads up in the Forsaken Heaven City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui nodded. "Alright, you can leave now. Remember the oath you swore just now. The next time you fall into my hands, I won't give you another chance."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I understand, I understand!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Dalang left while thanking Qing Shui repeatedly. However, he was the only one who knew what was going on in his mind. The group quickly left. Although most of them were seriously injured, they had to get out of here even if they had to crawl. After getting out of that place, they would then inform the people from the Wu Clan to bring them back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui made arrangements for the old woman to settle down. Her injuries were fine now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui hadn't expected that a simple recipe like this could also bring trouble. But then he found out the crux of this accident. A married lady set up a stall not far away from the old woman’s, and Wu Dalang had just gotten his hands on her recently. Her business wasn't doing well either; however, she saw that the old woman's business had become especially popular. In the past, the old woman's stall had been worse than hers; thus, she set her eyes on the old woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of that, such a situation had unfolded. Qing Shui had also seen that married lady previously. She looked quite pretty, and as she was already married; her figure was well-endowed and her gaze was misty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Dalang was considered a great profligate son and if the married lady wasn’t a beauty, he wouldn't have taken a fancy of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier on, the married lady had also been given a few slaps, and her face had swelled up. Someone like her with ill thoughts and poor behavior—even inciting Wu Dalang to bully the old woman—deserved to be beaten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This entire thing turned out to be an accident, but Qing Shui knew that the feud with the Nine Continents Martial Association had been established. However, he was very confident that he'd be able to deal with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next day, Qing Shui had nothing to do. He realized that it had been several days since he went to look for Tantai Lingyan and thus decided to look for her. There was a need for them to talk about love. Otherwise, there'd be no advancements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon Gate wasn't that far from Qing Shui's location. Of course, that was only the case if he used the Nine Continents Steps. Using just a single move, Qing Shui would be able to arrive in just the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui appeared in midair and didn't say a word. He knew that if Tantai Lingyan was around, she'd definitely come out. After a while and nothing happened, he spoke up, “Little Yanyan…” Somehow he knew that she was around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He only spoke once, called out a name, and stopped. Tantai Lingyan directly appeared not far away from Qing Shui and roared, "Why are you calling me with such weird name?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You used to like me calling you Little Yanyan in the past..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No matter what, you're just not allowed to call me that!" Tantai Lingyan realized that there was no way she could remain calm when talking to this shameless guy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then what should I call you?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Qing Shui's smile made Tantai Lingyan's heart uneasy. It wasn't because she was afraid, but she also had no idea why she felt this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're not allowed to call me that!" replied Tantai Lingyan with the same answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, I understand. It should be Madam Qing! Oh wait, that isn't right either. You're my wife, so this should be something other people call you..." Qing Shui acted as if he was thinking so hard about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan couldn’t help but slap Qing Shui's head.</span></p>
