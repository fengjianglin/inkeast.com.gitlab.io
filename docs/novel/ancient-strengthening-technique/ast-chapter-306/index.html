 <p><strong>Chapter 306 Qing Shui, I’m surnamed Song, I wish to court Sikong Mingyue.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>AST 306 - Qing Shui, I’m surnamed Song, I wish to court Sikong Mingyue</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Demonic beasts of the same level would always be stronger than humans. The most important thing was that it was exceedingly difficult to tame demonic beasts at the Martial King level and above. If not, there was no reason why the mount of that powerful old blindee was merely a Black Champion Monarch Falcon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that the power level of his firebird now was extremely strong; he sent his thoughts to the firebird, commanding it to spit out a fireball to see its current strength.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the instant the firebird spat out a violet-colored fireball, Qing Shui was taken aback. The size of the fire ball was smaller by many times, only about the size of a fist. The color of the flames, however, was of an even higher grade violet, appearing pure and crystalline. Without a doubt, the temperature of it was many times higher compared to before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From the intensity of the blast as well as the speed of its fireball shot, Qing Shui felt as if he was standing in the midst of a hurricane. Did the talent awakening enhance its firepower? Qing Shui was so happy, he stood there like an idiot.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The stronger his pet became, the happier he would be!</span></p>
  <p><span style>After exiting the Violet Jade Immortal Realm, Qing Shui was deep in his thoughts. He would never have imagined that the beast pills he concocted could ‘awaken’ the talent and bloodline of his firebird.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Thinking again, Cang Wuya had once said that the concoction rate of the Beast Pill and Spirit Concentrating Pill was only fifty percent. This meant that out of every two tries, he would succeed once. However, the time wasted during each failure probably caused many alchemists to feel that the success rate of fifty percent was still too low.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The firebird had consumed a total of about eighty or more Beast Bills. The price of these pills was extraorbitant when added together. Other than him, who else could throw out pills with such ease? Even the Medicine Sect couldn’t be compared to him in terms of concocting pills. Not unless they could concoct pills with primordial flames as well...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Time flew by. Roughly two months had passed and it was already the middle of November, with only a short time remaining to the end of the year. At this moment, Qing Shui was practising his daily morning ritual in the public hall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Outsiders couldn’t tell what was the difference in Qing Shui’s Taichi fist, yet Qing Shui could clearly sense that his strength had undergone a qualitative change when compared to two months ago.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With the effect of the Spirit Concentrating Pills, he spent a total of two months in his spatial realm which equates to about five years in ardous cultivation. It was only natural that he had improved.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His Ancient Strengthening Technique had already reached the 99th cycle, and he was extremely proficient in Frenzied Bull’s Strength, granting him a huge increase in power. Yet, he was still waiting for that spark of insight to break through.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His Cloudmist, Free Spirit Steps and Heavenly Palace Sword Art had reached the peak of the Ancestor Realm. The reason why they hadn’t reached the Truth Realm yet was because Qing Shui spent the majority of his time practising his other techniques.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Not only that, Qing Shui was truly astounded by the heaven-defying effects of the spirit concentrating pill. When he wasn’t in his spatial realm, Qing Shui would listen to the guidance of the Palace’s elders while also practising the insights of the Tiger Form he gained from the stone monuments.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Not only that, there were two carvings which Qing Shui felt to be extremely powerful. They were the Bear Leaning Against the Tree and the Gigantic Bear Shaking the Mountains. He could feel that the movements and energy within were an eruption of one’s hidden potential, instantly causing one’s strength to skyrocket, catching opponents by surprise and obtaining victory.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, Qing Shui was practising his Taichi Fist in the public square, his movements as fluid as water. Qing Shui had long amalgamated Frenzied Bull’s Strength together with his Ancient Strengthening Technique. Both sources of Qi combined into one, flowing smoothly in his body, yet was filled with an unprecedented explosive strength.</span></p>
  <p><span style>That state of flowing water felt extremely mystical as it drew the attention of others in the square. Only when Qing Shui completed the set of Tai Chi movements did those who were lost in their observations awakened.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, a voice rang out just as Qing Shui retracted back his hands. “You are Qing Shui?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t reply until after he fully retracted his hands. Glancing upwards, he saw a penetratingly handsome young man standing about two metres away from him. At the same time, a skinny youth stood beside him, unknowingly adopting the posture of a lackey.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The handsome young man’s eyes were full of self confidence and pride, as he stared with contempt at Qing Shui. Qing Shui could sense that the person standing before him had a cultivation level at the peak of the second level of Martial King, and the energy fluctuations from his body were many times stronger compared to Gongsun Jianwu.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Who are you?” Although Qing Shui didn’t know the background of the guy, he knew that from his cultivation level that there was no way this person was from the Starmoon Hall.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My surname is Song. Qing Shui, I wish to court Sikong Mingyue.” The handsome guy surnamed Song smiled at Qing Shui, his smile filled with confidence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was thunderstruck. Why was this guy looking for him? Although he had a good relationship with Canghai Mingyue, she wasn’t his woman after all. She had the freedom to choose who she liked and Qing Shui couldn’t control her. Love cannot be forced.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, the guy in front of him gave Qing Shui a weird feeling. For some unknown reason, he just felt pissed off when looking at him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I want you to leave her. Name me your conditions.” The handsome youth surnamed Song’s lips curled up. He should have appeared extremely imposing just like a handsome peacock.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The moment Qing Shui heard the commanding tone of this guy, his expression turned grim as his brows furrowed. Why did he want him to leave her? He had not seen either Canghai Mingyue nor Huoyun Liu-Li for over a month.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t understand what you are saying.” Qing Shui prepared to leave immediately after speaking. However, he found his way barred by that skinny fellow.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My Senior brother Song never agreed that you could leave. Hey, brat, you better be smart and leave sister Mingyue.” A crafty smile gleamed in the eyes of that skinny youth as he leered at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Waa it’s the chief disciple of the Starday Hall, Song Lang!” Someone exclaimed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wow, isn’t that Qing Shui from our Starmoon Hall?” Some of the females of the Starmoon Hall cheered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you think Song Lang is more powerful or our Qing Shui is?” Another female giggled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>………………..</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Senior Song is sooooooooo good looking!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You have big breasts, but no brains. Why are you supporting some other guy who’s not from our Hall?” A young man shouted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you f***ing stupid? Senior Song’s features are much more refined. He’s the man all women hope to marry. In any case, can the men of Starmoon Hall even be considered men?” The female earlier retorted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“B*tch!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m going into your room tonight to fuck the sh*t out of you and let you know the power of a real man.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Coming into my room? Come if you dare. I shall cut off that pathetic thingy you call a ‘little bird’, you a**hole.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>…………………………...</span></p>
  <p><span style>The handsome guy surnamed Song smiled even wider as he heard the discussion of the crowd. The smile of his exuded such brilliance that many females in the crowd were mesmerized.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, we support you. SMASH THAT SONG LANG!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>No one knew who called out but the person who was definitely a guy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“SMASH SONG LANG!!!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Male voice after male voice rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled bitterly. It seemed that the female’s earlier remark of ‘can the men of Starmoon Hall even be considered men?’ struck a nerve amongst the men of Starmoon Hall. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at Song Lang who was in front of him. There was no anger even after he heard the words of the crowd, only that unchanging, brilliant smile. Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel disgusted by that smile of his.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew what Song Lang was feeling now. To him, all these ‘talents’ were merely mediocre. Upon reaching his level in cultivation, all these people were merely ants. How could he be offended by words of an insect?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Out of my way!” Qing Shui spoke softly, as he walked forwards.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The skinny fellow unconsciously staggered backwards by the aura Qing Shui emitted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you intending to hide? How about we have a little match? If you win, Canghai Mingyue belongs to you, but if you lose, you have to leave her.” Song Lang was still smiling as he spoke out.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“Waa it’s the chief disciple of the Starday Hall, Song Lang!” Someone exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, isn’t that Qing Shui from our Starmoon Hall?” Some of the females of the Starmoon Hall cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think Song Lang is more powerful or our Qing Shui is?” Another female giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>………………..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Song is sooooooooo good looking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have big breasts, but no brains. Why are you supporting some other guy who’s not from our Hall?” A young man shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you f***ing stupid? Senior Song’s features are much more refined. He’s the man all women hope to marry. In any case, can the men of Starmoon Hall even be considered men?” The female earlier retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B*tch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going into your room tonight to fuck the sh*t out of you and let you know the power of a real man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coming into my room? Come if you dare. I shall cut off that pathetic thingy you call a ‘little bird’, you a**hole.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…………………………...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The handsome guy surnamed Song smiled even wider as he heard the discussion of the crowd. The smile of his exuded such brilliance that many females in the crowd were mesmerized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, we support you. SMASH THAT SONG LANG!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one knew who called out but the person who was definitely a guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“SMASH SONG LANG!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Male voice after male voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled bitterly. It seemed that the female’s earlier remark of ‘can the men of Starmoon Hall even be considered men?’ struck a nerve amongst the men of Starmoon Hall. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at Song Lang who was in front of him. There was no anger even after he heard the words of the crowd, only that unchanging, brilliant smile. Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel disgusted by that smile of his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui knew what Song Lang was feeling now. To him, all these ‘talents’ were merely mediocre. Upon reaching his level in cultivation, all these people were merely ants. How could he be offended by words of an insect?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Out of my way!” Qing Shui spoke softly, as he walked forwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skinny fellow unconsciously staggered backwards by the aura Qing Shui emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you intending to hide? How about we have a little match? If you win, Canghai Mingyue belongs to you, but if you lose, you have to leave her.” Song Lang was still smiling as he spoke out.</span></p>
