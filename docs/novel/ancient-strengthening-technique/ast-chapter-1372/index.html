 <p><strong>AST 1372 - Yelang Clan in the Continent's Capital, Nine Animals Phoenix Form, Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack</strong></p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui stayed for a full ten days at Qing Clan. Other than the time he spent in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would use the rest of his time to help his family members increase their abilities.</p>
 <p>This place was like a bottomless hole that couldn't be filled to the brim no matter how hard he tried. Each time Qing Shui came back, he would have things to do. This time around, the work waiting for him was much better than before. The Five Elements Spring of Life was undoubtedly very powerful and even the picky Qing Shui felt that it was perfect.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui left, he couldn't head to the Western Oxhe Continent. After all, Yehuang Guwu was at the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Therefore, Qing Shui used the Five Elements Divine Flag's teleportation abilities between the husband and wife flags and appeared at the Imperial Cuisine Hall directly.</p>
 <p>When Yehuang Guwu saw Qing Shui, she gave him a hug happily. They were in Yehuang Guwu's room. Ten days was considered to be a short absence and there was a saying which said that a short absence makes the heart grow fonder. They spent half a day embracing each other in the room.</p>
 <p>Food and sex are human nature. Most men would need to have sex at least once every two to three days and many powerful men required the companionship of women every night. Of course, the prerequisite was that there were no special situations.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Nine Yang Golden Body and it had even surpassed the Grand Perfection Stage. Back when he was at the Grand Perfection Stage, he was still unable to fend off Yehuang Guwu's ice-flame aura. However, right now, he felt that she was no different from other women. If he must say there was some difference, it could be that Yehuang Guwu was more horny because she was a White Tiger.</p>
 <p>In Qing Shui's previous life, people tended to say that the White Tiger would bring catastrophe to her husband. Qing Shui had no idea if that was true but after coming to the nine continents, Qing Shui saw for himself that this saying about the White Tiger was true. However, if the man's life and physique were tough enough, then the White Tiger would bring great fortune to the husband instead.</p>
 <p>After spending some time thinking about it, Qing Shui knew the reason. The main reason was that women who were White Tigers were very horny and women with the "White Tiger" physique would cause men to find them irresistible. There was no chance that the man would wither and the "White Tiger" woman's desires were also very strong. There were no men who would be able to withstand the temptation and thus, if a man who wasn't powerful were to indulge in such an act every night, he would of course die. Therefore, this was the origin of the saying that White Tiger women brought catastrophe to their husbands.</p>
 <p>In the nine continents, "White Tiger" women were like the vixens in Qing Shui's previous life.</p>
 <p>"Little Wuwu, you're becoming increasingly like a demoness." Qing Shui smiled as he embraced that beautiful figure which was like white jade.</p>
 <p>"Do you like it?" Yehuang Guwu said happily.</p>
 <p>"I do, I like it too much. Thank goodness your husband's physique is good, otherwise, I'd definitely be dried up by you." Qing Shui didn't exaggerate.</p>
 <p>"Do you think that we'll be able to have kids?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Yehuang Guwu often played with Soulsearch's child. Right now, she was the child's godmother, because he was the child's godfather.</p>
 <p>With this identity, the kid would often be brought out to play by Yehuang Guwu. Even Soulsearch felt a little jealous that his kid was blessed. Before the child could even walk, he already had a godfather and godmother who were both at the False God level.</p>
 <p>"In the future, we'll have a few rounds every day. There shouldn't be any problems." The chances for False Gods to get pregnant were even lower but it wasn't impossible. This was the world's rules.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't very worried. He had confidence in himself. It was just that the chances of getting pregnant were low. When the attempts increased, the chances would also naturally increase.</p>
 <p>When Yehuang Guwu heard what Qing Shui said, she threw him an annoyed glance that made her look very charming.</p>
 <p>"I'm serious." Yehuang Guwu said, at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>"I'm serious, too." Qing Shui meant what he said...</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu gave it some thought and then bit down on Qing Shui's face, leaving behind a bite mark. It wasn't painful for Qing Shui but the moment she did so, she felt a little regretful. It was because she was worried that if Qing Shui didn't remove the mark, then other people might see it when he headed out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui teased Yehuang Guwu for a while before he removed the bite mark. This was the enjoyment the couple had in the bedroom. Of course, he wouldn't bring it out to let people make a joke out of it. This was regardless of how close the other party was to them.</p>
 <p>"Tianhe Renmo came to look for you but you weren't around. He said that he'll come by at a later time." Yehuang Guwu helped Qing Shui tidy up his collar and said.</p>
 <p>"Oh, right, do you know which clan the Tianhe Clan has a feud with in the continent's capital?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and asked. Back then, when he was at the Tianhe Clan, he had heard some news but didn't probe further. After all, the matter was none of his concern.</p>
 <p>"I didn't spend a long time in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Master brought me to the Putuo Mountain very long ago. I have basically been staying in the Western Oxhe Continent all this while. However, I heard something earlier as well. After all, Tianhe Renmo is one of the strongest amongst the younger generation and thus news about him is well-known. It was that event which gave him a huge blow and resulted in the situation which you saw. His fiancee was taken by someone else as a concubine but he was no match for the person. It was impossible for the Tianhe Clan to take any action just for the sake of a junior over affairs concerning women either."</p>
 <p>"What clan was it? Are they that powerful? "</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was even more curious now.</p>
 <p>"It's the Yelang Clan in the continent's capital. They are a clan that's even more powerful than the Tianhe Clan. That's what everyone says. As for whether it's true or not, I have no idea." Yehuang Guwu gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't very concerned over whether the rumor was true or not. He only wanted to know more information. At the very least, he now knew that the Yelang Clan had quite a good standing in the continent's capital. The continent's capital was a bigger platform for powerful clans. Most of the powerful clans in each country's capital were the side branches of the greater clans, while those who were in the continent's capital were even more powerful in comparison to these side branches.</p>
 <p>It was because the continent's capital was the place which took up the most prosperous area in the region. Every country's capital would have to hand over 20% or more of their profits to the continent's capital. It was like how those cities that had a lower standing than a country's capital would have to provide them with a portion of their profits.</p>
 <p>The amount given would be a designated amount. If the amount given wasn't enough, the continent's capital had the ability to take away the ability of the country's capital.</p>
 <p>The continent's capital was composed of a group of powers. It was a bit hard for a single clan to dominate over an entire continent and thus the continent's capital was dominated by a group of powers. A group of clans and other powers that had common interests would form something like an alliance, sharing all their benefits and resources.</p>
 <p>However, there would be a leader amongst a group like this, coming from one of the clans. The leader would be someone picked by the others and must be able to convince others with his own cultivation and prestige.</p>
 <p>Not only did these people receive the money and treasures from others, they must also continue to suppress cities or countries who didn't bow down to them. When the region got bigger, with the formation of a leading alliance, there would naturally also be other groups forming. While it appeared that some powers seemed to be the ones dominating an entire continent, there were some countries that had maintained a neutral standing. It was the same for some cities. It was impossible for all of them to remain silent and abiding. Generally, those that were dominated by the dominating alliance would be about one-third. This was already considered quite a big amount.</p>
 <p>The remaining two-thirds were a chaotic mix of all sorts of people. This was something very normal.</p>
 <p>Since the area was too large, power would be delegated downward and places that were further away were practically independent.</p>
 <p>"Do you know which clans in the continent's capital belong to which respective powers?" Qing Shui was referring to the powers that dominated in name.</p>
 <p>"There are many. It's no secret. So many years have passed and I'm not too sure either. When you reach the continent's capital, you'll be able to get this news easily," Yehuang Guwu smiled and said.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal very early. It was because after attaining a breakthrough to the eighth heavenly layer, the Phoenix Form in the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique had lit up, indicating that Qing Shui could start cultivating it.</p>
 <p>Dragons and phoenixes were legendary creatures but they did exist in the world of the nine continents. In Qing Shui's previous life, there were many descriptions which associated dragons with men and phoenixes with women. The characters used to describe male and female phoenixes were different but people were used to using the two characters together when referring to phoenixes [1]. When used to describe people, the phoenix was generally associated with ladies. Viewed as the king of all birds, the phoenix held a very high status.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the battle techniques which he could learn, he was stunned. Right now, he could only learn two of the battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack!</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix was a kind of Qi technique that could reduce all of the opponent's abilities by 10%. It could be stacked with other Qi related techniques.</p>
 <p>Was it that simple? It was what its name suggested: Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, the aura of a sovereign. Furthermore, it could be stacked with other techniques which weakened the opponents. The first thing that came to Qing Shui mind was the Emperor's Qi. When the two of them were stacked together, he would be able to weaken his opponents by 30%.</p>
 <p>30% was considered to be quite significant. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's 10% wasn't something that could be guaranteed but this 30% was sufficient to deal a huge blow to his opponents, since it was a reduction to their overall abilities.</p>
 <p>The description then went on to the cultivation method. It wasn't very difficult but Qing Shui wasn't in any hurry to start now. Instead, he turned to look at the Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack.</p>
 <p>Music score?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that the thing there was actually something that looked like a music score. Cultivating this required the use of a zither and it must be one that was made from the wood of a Chinese parasol tree [2].</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the required wood. The resting place of the Fire Bird in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was definitely considered to be the best wood from the Chinese parasol tree. It was just that the method of making the zither seemed to be very special as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't take a close look at that but looked toward the few types of Phoenix Cries.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Cry (Battle): Can increase the target's battle will, allowing the target's abilities to be fully unleashed or even to bring them beyond their full potential.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Cry (Eruption): Can increase target's battle prowess, giving a certain chance of letting the attacking power be doubled.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Cry (Break): Can increase target's chances of bypassing the opponent's defense, to a certain degree.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Cry (Retreat): Can reduce the target's battle will, causing the target to be unable to perform as well as usual.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this, he was overjoyed. To think that these were possible. It seemed to be very amazing and powerful. Qing Shui had no idea what it was really like when put into use. He decided to make a zither during this period of time. As for the Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack, he didn't feel like learning it, at least, not at the moment. It was nothing for a man to be holding a zither. On the contrary, it was very normal. However, Qing Shui knew nothing about music and melody.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Qing Shui felt that it was still better to learn the domineering Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix. With his current abilities, after further weakening all of the opponent's abilities by 30%, his opponents would all be left demoralized and crying.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started to cultivate. It could be due to the martial techniques he knew or maybe due to the existence of the Emperor's Qi, that the rate at which Qing Shui learned the technique was very fast, with no challenges. It was a technique that was strangely similar to the Emperor's Qi but just wasn't as domineering.</p>
 <p>One day passed by. Qing Shui hadn't succeeded in learning it completely but the progress was going smoothly. Qing Shui took a rest and then took a branch off that huge Chinese parasol tree. This tree had received the nourishment from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal's spiritual Qi. Moreover, having the Fire Bird resting on the tree was also,in a way, a nurturing of the tree's spiritual intelligence.</p>
 <p>There was of course no need to consider whether the tree was of the appropriate age. Qing Shui first studied the method of creating the zither. As he read through the description, the information seemed to have been imprinted into his mind. He quickly managed to remember all the small details and then tried to simulate the production process in his mind.</p>
 <p>[1] Feng and Huang refers to the male and female phoenixes respectively but people generally combined the two to form Feng Huang when referring to the phoenix in general.</p>
 <p>[2] The Chinese parasol tree is often associated with the Phoenix with the saying that Phoenixes like to rest on them.</p>
