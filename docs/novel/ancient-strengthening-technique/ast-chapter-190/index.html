  <p><strong>AST 190 – Don’t Stop Me</strong></p>
  <p>As Tong Tu listened to Qing Shui’s emotionless words, a feeling of helplessness he had never felt before arose within him. He felt like a hero driven to his wit’s end, like the beauty lamenting on the lost prime that was irretrievable!</p>
  <p>“Leave a path for the Tong Clan and let me die in peace. If not, I’ll not let you go even if I were to become a ghost.” Tong Tu looked at Qing Shui and said calmly. He knew that he would be dying very soon.</p>
  <p>“It’s none of my business whether you will die in peace. As for after you’ve become a ghost, hmph, you were useless when you were alive, so what can you do to me after you die? But I will not eradicate the roots; so long as they don’t bother me, I won’t be bothered with them.” Qing Shui said without a care.</p>
  <p>“You guys go back home and carry on a message. Tell the clan head and Old Master to not step out of Silver Spear City for a hundred years!” After saying this, he coughed out a mouthful of blood and dropped to the ground.</p>
  <p>A few members of the Tong Clan came up and moved his corpse away. At the same time, they took back the the two pieces of the broken dragon spear!</p>
  <p>Silence resumed on the Arena, and no one dared to step up anymore. While Tong Tu’s abilities were not high, with Tong Clan’s unique sword techniques coupled with the dragon spear, even those grade 5 Xiantian cultivators would not dare to trifle with him easily. </p>
  <p>Silver Spear City’s Tong Clan was considered to be one of the most prominent clans in Cang Lang Country. There was also a few old men in the Tong Clan who not only had good spears, but also their abilities were also not weak. The strongest of them all was only one grade lower than Baili Jingwei. It was said that his Black Dragon Spear was not an ordinary item, and if he were to battle with Baili Jingwei, it would be hard to tell who would emerge as the eventual victor.</p>
  <p>“What is the actual abilities of Elder Qing Shui? As his teacher, are you aware?” Zhu Qing asked, half teasingly but also half seriously.</p>
  <p>“About this, I’m really not sure.” Yiye Jiange smiled, embarrassed. After all, when the disciple is strong, it brings honor to the master, but when the disciple is stronger than the master and has not learned any of his or her master’s techniques, it was something that others could not fathom.</p>
  <p>After the people from the Tong Clan had left, Qing Shui wanted to step down as well. However, at that moment, a lady stepped up onto the Arena,</p>
  <p>She was well-developed with an enchanting figure. Her presence was charming, and she gave off an intoxicating charm as she walked. Her beautiful hair flowed down her shoulders. She had beautiful eyes like peach blossoms and an upright nose. She had these slightly perked cherry blossom lips that could trigger any man’s thoughts to run wild, even though they were not the most beautiful lips Qing Shui had ever seen.</p>
  <p>She had the best proportionally snake-like figure and well-developed butt that was perked at just the right angle. Her curves were extremely beautiful. When she walked, she sashayed along with her pair of slender long legs; it was as if she was a fairy taking a stroll.</p>
  <p>“Wow, the most beautiful lady of the Joyous Sect!” Someone from the crowd shouted.</p>
  <p>“Joyous Sect, tsk tsk, whoever could hold a woman from the Joyous Sect would definitely die of happiness.” An uncle looked at the lady on the stage and groaned.</p>
  <p>“The ladies from Joyous Sect are not only beautiful, but their skills in bed are the best as well. The guys who can enter the Joyous Sect all lead lives better than that of deities.” A passionate youth said.</p>
  <p>“Brother, you’re right. It’s too bad that the requirements to enter the Joyous Sect are too harsh. Even if someone was able to get in, he may not necessarily be able to practise Duo Cultivation.” Another youth lamented.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui took a glance at the lady and could not help but admit that the lady before him was very beautiful, to the extent that she would not lose out to Wenren Wu-Shuang. However, Qing Shui’s mind was filled with Shi Qingzhuang, so he wanted to ignore the lady directly.</p>
  <p>“I want to challenge you!” A lady’s voice with a tinge of unisexual magnetism sounded. It sounded very nice, and it was comparable to that of Huoyun Liu-Li, causing Qing Shui to freeze.</p>
  <p>“I only kill, I don’t take part in competitions.” Qing Shui could not help but take a look at that seductive, charming face, especially those soft, sexy lips that would make men to go crazy.</p>
  <p>“I’m not afraid!” The lady’s expression did not change. She had an attractive face that hid her seriousness and stubborness.</p>
  <p>“That’s enough, I’m not free. Don’t force me.” Qing Shui moved to take his leave.</p>
  <p>“Are you worried for that lady from the Torrid Fragrance Sect?” The lady reached out her hands to block Qing Shui’s path.</p>
  <p>Ka!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui pointed the Big Dipper Sword on the lady’s shoulder. The attack was like shooting stars chasing after the moon. The cracking of bones was extremely piercing to the ears. The lady was pushed back a few steps but she managed to keep standing. A trickle of blood could be seen at the corner of her lips.</p>
  <p>“I’m not free, but if you were to keep standing in my way, I would not mind killing you.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was very annoyed as he headed straight for the area where the Torrid Fragrance Sect was at.</p>
  <p>“Jiange, I didn’t know that your disciple was so cool,” Zhu Qing said to Yiye Jiange, “To think that such a seemingly bashful young man could actually destroy flowers viciously.” Zhu Qing’s eyes gleamed as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange seemed pretty calm, but she was feeling very complicated inside. A few days back, that guy was still telling her about teaching the lass how to read and learn martial arts, and that he even helped to clean the lass’s butt. It was hard for her to think that such a warm person was the same person as the Qing Shui on the stage now.</p>
  <p>“Cool, seems like destroying flowers viciously is the trend now.” The uncle got excited again.</p>
  <p>“It’ll be even more trendy if you were to go back and viciously destroy your mom.” A lady from the Joyous Sect spoke out angrily.</p>
  <p>Uncle: “…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui went up to the beautiful middle-aged woman who was carrying Shi Qingzhuang and said, “Pass Qingzhuang to me. She should be fine by the end of the competition.” Qing Shui reached out his hands.</p>
  <p>The charming, beautiful middle-aged woman looked at Qing Shui and frowned slightly, as if she wanted to say something. However, she remained silent as she lightly passed Shi Qingzhuang to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carefully carried Shi Qingzhuang, raised his head, and told the beautiful middle-aged woman, “Qingzhuang is my fiancee, you don’t have to worry about handing her over to me.”</p>
  <p>The beautiful middle-aged woman and the tall lady both froze!</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang silently watched everything that Qing Shui had done. She had a light smile on her face, but tens of thousands of thoughts flickered through her mind. Eventually, she remained standing there in a daze.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carried Shi Qingzhuang to Yiye Jiange, but did not speak because he was worried that she would not like the idea of bringing Shi Qingzhuang to the Cloud Mist Peak.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go, I’ll send you two back to the Cloud Mist Peak.” Yiye Jiange said, and began leading the way out.</p>
  <p>“Is she alright?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and asked softly.</p>
  <p>Shi Qingzhuang had long since fallen asleep. Carrying her soft figure, he felt nothing but pity. Her cold face looked so pale as though it was devoid of blood.</p>
  <p>“It’s fine. She’ll be fine under my care for a few days.” Qing Shui looked at Shi Qingzhuang as he spoke, not even lifting his head.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange felt very strange. The guy who was usually respectful and seemingly intoxicated with her now did not even care to take a look at her. It felt as if something that once belonged to her was taken away from her.</p>
  <p>She felt uncomfortable and unfamiliar, as well as disappointed!</p>
  <p>She was sure that she had not fallen in love with this guy who addressed her as his master. But why would she feel a bit sad on seeing how cold he was to her now?</p>
  <p>Along the way, Qing Shui did not speak another word. The more he acted like this, the more uncomfortable Yiye Jiange felt. However, she silently told herself, “he has grown up, and it is normal that he has someone who he likes. What’s there to be unhappy about?”</p>
  <p>After sorting out her thoughts, Yiye Jiange smiled as she looked at Qing Shui’s worried expression. She realized that this chap was actually really affectionate. The problem he got himself into in Hundred Miles City seemed to be because of that beautiful lady boss from Yu He Inn.</p>
  <p>Such a frivolous player…</p>
  <p>Very soon, the Snow White Crane landed on the Cloud Mist Peak. Qing Shui carried Shi Qingzhuang dismounted, smiling as he said, “Master, thank you. You can go back to your work!”</p>
  <p>“Why? Now that you have your fiance, you want to keep your distance from me? Do you now find me bothersome?” Yiye Jiange said, half-jokingly.</p>
  <p>“How could that be? Moreover, look at how badly wounded she is. What can we do? How can you be a bother?” Qing Shui said with a bitter face.</p>
  <p>“I had just started thinking that you’ve matured, but now you’ve learnt to be bad. How dare you tease me?” Yiye Jiange said to Qing Shui with a slight annoyance as she went up the Snow White Crane.</p>
  <p>“I have a lot of blankets in my room. If you don’t have any, you can get them from my room.” Yiye Jiange felt weird, and quickly left on the Snow White Crane.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned, but smiled lewdly as he carried Shi Qingzhuang to his room at the back and lightly placed her on his bed.</p>
  <p>After checking on her injuries, he took out the nine Gold Needles. Seemed like both the Small Revitalizing Pellet and the Golden Sore Ointment had taken effect, but the most effective treatment was still the Gold Needles.</p>
  <p>After covering Shi Qingzhuang in the blanket, Qing Shui grinned. “I’m not only short of blankets, but short of a lot of them. Seems like I’ll have to borrow a few from Master’s place.”</p>

 <p>“It’ll be even more trendy if you were to go back and viciously destroy your mom.” A lady from the Joyous Sect spoke out angrily.</p>
 <p>Uncle: “…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went up to the beautiful middle-aged woman who was carrying Shi Qingzhuang and said, “Pass Qingzhuang to me. She should be fine by the end of the competition.” Qing Shui reached out his hands.</p>
 <p>The charming, beautiful middle-aged woman looked at Qing Shui and frowned slightly, as if she wanted to say something. However, she remained silent as she lightly passed Shi Qingzhuang to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carefully carried Shi Qingzhuang, raised his head, and told the beautiful middle-aged woman, “Qingzhuang is my fiancee, you don’t have to worry about handing her over to me.”</p>
 <p>The beautiful middle-aged woman and the tall lady both froze!</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang silently watched everything that Qing Shui had done. She had a light smile on her face, but tens of thousands of thoughts flickered through her mind. Eventually, she remained standing there in a daze.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried Shi Qingzhuang to Yiye Jiange, but did not speak because he was worried that she would not like the idea of bringing Shi Qingzhuang to the Cloud Mist Peak.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, I’ll send you two back to the Cloud Mist Peak.” Yiye Jiange said, and began leading the way out.</p>
 <p>“Is she alright?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and asked softly.</p>
 <p>Shi Qingzhuang had long since fallen asleep. Carrying her soft figure, he felt nothing but pity. Her cold face looked so pale as though it was devoid of blood.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. She’ll be fine under my care for a few days.” Qing Shui looked at Shi Qingzhuang as he spoke, not even lifting his head.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange felt very strange. The guy who was usually respectful and seemingly intoxicated with her now did not even care to take a look at her. It felt as if something that once belonged to her was taken away from her.</p>
 <p>She felt uncomfortable and unfamiliar, as well as disappointed!</p>
 <p>She was sure that she had not fallen in love with this guy who addressed her as his master. But why would she feel a bit sad on seeing how cold he was to her now?</p>
 <p>Along the way, Qing Shui did not speak another word. The more he acted like this, the more uncomfortable Yiye Jiange felt. However, she silently told herself, “he has grown up, and it is normal that he has someone who he likes. What’s there to be unhappy about?”</p>
 <p>After sorting out her thoughts, Yiye Jiange smiled as she looked at Qing Shui’s worried expression. She realized that this chap was actually really affectionate. The problem he got himself into in Hundred Miles City seemed to be because of that beautiful lady boss from Yu He Inn.</p>
 <p>Such a frivolous player…</p>
 <p>Very soon, the Snow White Crane landed on the Cloud Mist Peak. Qing Shui carried Shi Qingzhuang dismounted, smiling as he said, “Master, thank you. You can go back to your work!”</p>
 <p>“Why? Now that you have your fiance, you want to keep your distance from me? Do you now find me bothersome?” Yiye Jiange said, half-jokingly.</p>
 <p>“How could that be? Moreover, look at how badly wounded she is. What can we do? How can you be a bother?” Qing Shui said with a bitter face.</p>
 <p>“I had just started thinking that you’ve matured, but now you’ve learnt to be bad. How dare you tease me?” Yiye Jiange said to Qing Shui with a slight annoyance as she went up the Snow White Crane.</p>
 <p>“I have a lot of blankets in my room. If you don’t have any, you can get them from my room.” Yiye Jiange felt weird, and quickly left on the Snow White Crane.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned, but smiled lewdly as he carried Shi Qingzhuang to his room at the back and lightly placed her on his bed.</p>
 <p>After checking on her injuries, he took out the nine Gold Needles. Seemed like both the Small Revitalizing Pellet and the Golden Sore Ointment had taken effect, but the most effective treatment was still the Gold Needles.</p>
 <p>After covering Shi Qingzhuang in the blanket, Qing Shui grinned. “I’m not only short of blankets, but short of a lot of them. Seems like I’ll have to borrow a few from Master’s place.”</p>
