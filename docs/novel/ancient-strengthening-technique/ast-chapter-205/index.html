  <p><strong>AST 205 – What level of strength do I need to trample the Yan Clan?</strong></p>
  <p>“Yan City? The capital of Yanjiang country?” Canghai Mingyue glanced back as she asked. Under the night sky, she was so beautiful that it caused people to be dazzled and mesmerised- she was the epitome of beauty!</p>
  <p>“Mm!” Qingshui depressedly replied. Just thinking of his mother proved to be a great, big knot in his heart. This was also the greatest problem on the surface. Just thinking of the 19 years of suffering that his mother had went through, especially with the agony of being separated by her own flesh and blood… He thought of Little Yuchang and Luan Luan, especially that little girl back in the Hundred Miles City. It had been a year since he last saw her, and he already missed her terribly, not to mention his sister. She had been separated from Qing Yi for a whole 19 years, how much suffering did she go through?.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was somewhat dumbfounded as she gazed at this mysterious guy. In his eyes, one could see many complex emotions intermingling. There was gentleness, suffering, regret, hatred, anger, helplessness, and hope…</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue didn’t expect that a person’s gaze could actually be so complicated to this extent. The clear eyes of Qing Shui was also filled with an unyielding determination!</p>
  <p>He was someone with a story, but just what was his background that would cause him to react in such a way? Canghai Mingyue discovered that this little guy was more and more pleasing to the eye.</p>
  <p>If this news were to be known by those who were familiar by Canghai Mingyue, they would surely be shocked. Because, pleasing to the eye was the highest evaluation that Canghai Mingyue could give to any males other than her birth father!</p>
  <p>“Okay then, we will stop there for a while!” Canghai Mingyue lightly said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect that she would say this, and he stared at her, stunned for a moment before mounting the firebird and flying a distance before they landed.</p>
  <p>Now that there was still time, Qing Shui thought about what should he do after he arrived at Yan City. Currently, his level of power was still not high enough. The Yan Clan would still be able to smash him easily.</p>
  <p>“I’ve been thinking whether or not I should go to the Yan Clan after we land in the Yan City tomorrow.” Qing Shui sighed bitterly.</p>
  <p>“Do you have some troubles? Or it isn’t convenient to talk about it? If you don’t mind, I can be a listener. Maybe you would feel better.”<br></p>
  <p>Qing Shui actually had already discovered Canghai Mingyue, but was pretending otherwise. After which, he gazed at that heart-stirring countenance of her in surprise.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect that she would be here. No matter how beautiful she was, the possibility of ‘doing it in public’ didn’t even cross Qing Shui’s mind when it came to such a woman who seemed apathetic to everything.</p>
  <p>“What’s your objective for coming here?” Qing Shui unhappily glanced at Canghai Mingyue as he inquired.</p>
  <p>“Did you think that I’m truly worried about you, and I wish to interfere in your matters? I’m only afraid that you can’t think straight. And if something really happened to you, my silly disciple would be hurt.” Canghai Mingyue gazed at the moon as she replied.</p>
  <p>“Can I ask you something?” Qing Shui stared at the lofty, beautiful, extremely mesmerizing countenance of Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“Speak.”</p>
  <p>“What level of strength do I need to trample over the Yan Clan?” Qing Shui lightly inquired.</p>
  <p>“Canghai Mingyue’s delicate frame involuntarily trembled as the depth of her eyes became as deep as a bottomless pool. Her charming eyes caused Qing Shui to feel a sense of desire.</p>
  <p>Yan City was the capital of the Yan Jiang Country. There was 81 countries in the Greencloud Continent, and the capital was the concentration of each country’s power. The Yan Clan was the ruler of the Yan Jiang Country.</p>
  <p>“This fellow wants to wipe out the Yan Clan?” Canghai Mingyue gazed at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui silently stared at Canghai Mingyue, waiting for her reply.</p>
  <p>“Although the Greencloud Continent is one of the weakest continents in this world of the nine continents, it’s power is still something that can’t be ignored. In all of the 81 countries, the Yan Jiang country is ranked within the top 15. If you want to trample over the Yan Clan, your strength would need to be, at the very least, 5th Grade Martial King- and this is just a conservative estimate.” Canghai Mingyue sighed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had long guessed that there was a Martial King hidden in the Yan Clan. Back then when he asked Yiye Jiange, he had already somewhat expected this possibility. But he didn’t expect that the Yan Clan would actually be so strong to this extent. Having a power at the 5th Grade Martial King level was just a conservative estimate!<br></p>
  <p>After many long moments, Qing Shui also sighed!</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>“Thank you, but there’s no need to pass by the Yan Clan tomorrow. Let’s go back to the Greencloud Capital directly.” Qing Shui smiled as he spoke to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“It’s good that you are fine. Based on your potential, it’s just a matter of time. I hope you can keep your cool. This is something that cannot be rushed. After you mature, all these thorny problems would be solved easily with the mere flip of your palms. If you want to accomplish great things, you need to learn tolerance.” The deep, black eyes of Canghai was filled with beauty and intelligence, they emitted an aura that caused people to willingly bow in worship. </p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue left, she knew that Qing Shui needed some quiet time alone.</p>
  <p>After she had left, Qing Shui entered into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and frenziedly threw himself into cultivation. 5th Grade Martial King, how far away was that?</p>
  <p>He didn’t think that there would be such a character in the Yan Clan. Entering into a noble’s house via marriage is akin to entering the deep sea. To think that his mother would be a victim herself. For him to settle this debt of grudge and gratitude, it seemed that he had to breakthrough to the 5th Heavenly Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>Just thinking of it caused Qing Shui to be incomparably depressed.</p>
  <p>“If my firebird’s phoenix bloodline awakened, it would be of immense help to me.” Qing Shui knew that once his mount’s bloodline awakened, it would be a demonic beast at the Martial King level.</p>
  <p>However, this hope was too unlikely to happen; it was as though he was searching for a needle in the vast ocean!</p>
  <p>As for Bear Form, Qing Shui had already familiarised himself with it. The pent-up emotions in his heart was vented out by the execution of Bear Form. The seemingly clumsy Bear Form had its own area of specialization.</p>
  <p>For example, Bear’s Dazzle appeared to be a simple shake of the body, but the power of vibration contained within the move was extremely terrifying. When cultivated to the extreme, it would enable one’s body to even break steel!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui circulated that nameless cultivation art. Currently, he was already incomparably familiar with it. His body felt increasingly heavier, and Qing Shui knew that he wasn’t far off from reaching the boundaries of the small success stage.</p>
  <p>The small success stage of the Bear Form was achieved when one trained to increase his or her body weight, while the large success stage was achieved when one trained his or her body to be lighter again. As for the Great Perfection stage, that would require one to experience it for him or herself.</p>
  <p>A clumsy body unleashes clumsy moves, but the power contained within was incredibly violent. That power of laceration was pure brutality. Although the movement of the body looked clumsy, the arms were incomparably agile.</p>
  <p>As Qing Shui suddenly shook his body in the manner described, he suddenly had a miraculous feeling. It felt as though all the burdens and negative emotions contained in his heart was vented out via the execution of the technique.</p>
  <p>Cracks appeared on the surrounding of the space Qing Shui was standing on. The cracks were as wide and as long as two meters. The cracks looked like the strings of web on a spider’s spiderweb.</p>
  <p>It was the small success stage of the Bear Form. After a moment of shock, Qing Shui confirmed it. That increment and decrement of power in his body allowed Qing Shui to realize that he had already reached the small success stage of the Bear Form.</p>
  <p>However, that miraculous feeling Qing Shui felt still lingered in his mind. That shudder of the Bear’s Dazzle actually could make use of the negative energy of a human’s body that was augmented by pressure and rage. Who could have thought that the Bear’s Form would be able to cleanse one heart and mind, and ease stress. The category that the Bear Form belonged to – the life nurturing arts- wasn’t named in vain indeed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t know that his Bear’s Dazzle had already reached an extremely high profound realm, similar to his Realm of Sword Truths. </p>
  <p>The cracked surroundings was already a testament of it. However, Qing Shui wasn’t aware of what level he had actually reached!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui spent the rest of his time cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Qing Shui intended to cultivate to the peak of the 4th Heavenly Layer as soon as possible and find a chance to breakthrough to the 5th!</p>
  <p>Only by stepping into the 5th Heavenly Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique would he have the slightest hope to contend against the Yan Clan!</p>

 <p>The small success stage of the Bear Form was achieved when one trained to increase his or her body weight, while the large success stage was achieved when one trained his or her body to be lighter again. As for the Great Perfection stage, that would require one to experience it for him or herself.</p>
 <p>A clumsy body unleashes clumsy moves, but the power contained within was incredibly violent. That power of laceration was pure brutality. Although the movement of the body looked clumsy, the arms were incomparably agile.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui suddenly shook his body in the manner described, he suddenly had a miraculous feeling. It felt as though all the burdens and negative emotions contained in his heart was vented out via the execution of the technique.</p>
 <p>Cracks appeared on the surrounding of the space Qing Shui was standing on. The cracks were as wide and as long as two meters. The cracks looked like the strings of web on a spider’s spiderweb.</p>
 <p>It was the small success stage of the Bear Form. After a moment of shock, Qing Shui confirmed it. That increment and decrement of power in his body allowed Qing Shui to realize that he had already reached the small success stage of the Bear Form.</p>
 <p>However, that miraculous feeling Qing Shui felt still lingered in his mind. That shudder of the Bear’s Dazzle actually could make use of the negative energy of a human’s body that was augmented by pressure and rage. Who could have thought that the Bear’s Form would be able to cleanse one heart and mind, and ease stress. The category that the Bear Form belonged to – the life nurturing arts- wasn’t named in vain indeed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know that his Bear’s Dazzle had already reached an extremely high profound realm, similar to his Realm of Sword Truths. </p>
 <p>The cracked surroundings was already a testament of it. However, Qing Shui wasn’t aware of what level he had actually reached!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spent the rest of his time cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Qing Shui intended to cultivate to the peak of the 4th Heavenly Layer as soon as possible and find a chance to breakthrough to the 5th!</p>
 <p>Only by stepping into the 5th Heavenly Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique would he have the slightest hope to contend against the Yan Clan!</p>
