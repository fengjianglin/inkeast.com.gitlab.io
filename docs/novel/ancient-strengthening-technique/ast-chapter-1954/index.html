 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another thing was that Qing Zun and the others had already reached the latter phase of Martial Emperor and their power was growing steadily. Most importantly, Qing Ming had already reached Peak Martial Emperor and his battle strength was also the strongest. He was a natural assassin, a god among assassins, a sovereign of the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui still didn't know where Qing Ming's Underworld King Physique came from. Looking at how Qing Ming was smiling right now, Qing Shui knew that although he appeared like this at home, he would show a totally different side in battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The skills that Qing Yin learned were all over the place. She knew a lot of things, was proficient in the Nine Palace Steps, Taichi, and music. Qing Shui had guided her on her path, and the things he could help her in, was to provide her with some medicinal pills and to increase her abilities slightly periodically. If she wanted to excel in something, she would still have to rely on her own hard work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yin`er, Taichi emphasizes on the intent and using your intents to move your body. You're suitable to pick up Taichi, the key is to attack after your opponent does and suppress them, defeating strength with a weaker force. You can learn Acupuncture Hitting and Qi Hitting from me during this time!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, thank you, Father!" Qing Yin said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"To think that you're standing on ceremony with your father. We've really grown distant now." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's not true!" Qing Yin went up and hugged one of Qing Shui's arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This daughter misses you a lot, but even if I miss you, I'm not able to see you." Qing Yin pouted. It was rare for her to show her spoilt side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a little guilty as well. He patted her on the head and said, smiling. "My daughter has grown up and is going to spread her wings and soar in the sky. You must get stronger. The clan still needs you guys to support it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father is our great tree. To be honest, I don't really want to cultivate. The life that I want is just to learn some music and drawing." Qing Yin smiled. Her beautiful eyes and teeth bore a great resemblance to Canghai Mingyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father isn't asking you to learn a lot. You're the one who learns the least. However, you mustn't drop Taichi. This world reveres the strong and strength is what that'll back you up and be your foundation. Otherwise, even if you want to learn other things, you won't achieve much success. For example, someone who learns music normally for many years would not be comparable to a cultivator learning it for a year." Qing Shui wouldn't relent on this. Although Qing Yin did not pick up a lot of things, what she learned were the most complicated ones. She was kind and benevolent, and was the strongest in her mental realm. She had even touched Heavenly Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I knew that Father is the best."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tomorrow onward, you'll learn some other things. It won't be hard for someone of your level to comprehend, but it won't be easy to master them either." Qing Shui smiled and said. Although he did not want to be too strict with his children, there were still some areas in which he had to be strict with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People said that you should raise a son in a poor environment and a daughter in a rich environment. Qing Shui was considered to be very strict to his sons, and although it wasn't that he didn't give them any freedom at all, he asked a lot of them. On the other hand, he was more forgiving toward his daughters and didn't give them too much stress. He let them learn things that they were interested in and if things didn't work out, he would use medicinal pills and Strength Infusion as well as some other things to increase their abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yan had grown up as well and had grown increasingly distant from Qing Shui...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This daughter wasn't doing that well in her cultivation. Her talent wasn't comparable to Qing Yin and the others. She was about the same as Yuchang, but was considered to have the weakest talent amongst those of her generation. Qing Shui used medicinal pills and other means to help her raise her cultivation. If she was to be put outside, she'd be considered as some kind of genius, but she still couldn't be compared with himself and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, with time, the difference between her and the others would just grow wider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that this daughter who appeared weak was actually very headstrong. She didn't want to lose to her siblings. In Qing Shui's previous life, they say that success was achieved through 99% hard work and 1% talent. This saying was emphasizing on the importance of hard work. However, this was only a form of consolation as everyone knew that the 1% talent was even more important than the 99% hard work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yan`er, come over here and tell Father what you've been busy with recently." Qing Shui smiled and pat the spot next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yan smiled and sat down next to Qing Shui. She was naturally very happy to see that Qing Shui was back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm learning how to do business with Mother." Qing Yan smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui still saw that hint of disappointment in the depths of Qing Yan's eyes when she smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His daughter had grown up and knew how to think in other people's shoes now. She also knew how to hide some of her emotions as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then do you still cultivate?" Qing Shui wrapped his hand around Qing Yan's shoulder with one hand, and Qing Yin's with another. As for his sons, they didn't have such treatment of getting to sit next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, I cultivate whenever I have time. This daughter of yours is stupid and won't have much progress in the cultivation. I'll just take it as a way to strengthen my body and to keep me healthy."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a little sad. He felt that his abilities weren't bad and had even powerful medical skills. However, there was no way for him to change a person's aptitude. Even if he could increase one's aptitude, it would only be for a very little bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who says that my daughter is stupid? Lass, you are in no way stupider than anyone else." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm Father's daughter, so you'll naturally not say that I'm stupid."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lass, you can learn formations with me from tomorrow onward. Also, put more work onto the Nine Palace Steps and learn the Acupuncture Hitting Clearing Meridians from me together with Yin`er. My daughter isn't stupid, but normal things just aren't suitable for you." Qing Shui looked at Qing Yan dotingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father, can I really do it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yan was actually afraid of being disappointed again. In fact, she wasn't scared of disappointing herself, but she didn't want to disappoint Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had lived two lifetimes and also grew up as a child. Moreover, he had also experienced a lot in this lifetime and could tell what Qing Yan's hesitations were. He smiled and said, "Lass, you're the apple of Father's eye. All of you are Father's pride, and you always will be."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yan smiled very happily. Her heart seemed a lot brighter than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Qing Shui wanted to teach Qing Yan formations was because he knew that this daughter of his was very logical. Moreover, she had also learned a little bit of it in the past. Qing Shui wasn't planning on letting her learn too many different formations. Just one will do. If it worked, then she could learn a few more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Palace Steps was to be used together with the formations.</span></p>

Qing Yu pouted and squeezed into Qing Shui's arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yu had grown up as well. What had surprised Qing Shui was that this daughter had an exceptional talent. She had always been the one who pestered him the most while growing up, and it was still the same now.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qing Shui gave it some thought before saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui called out the Gold Dragon. It shouldn't have completely matured yet, but almost matured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had never let Little Gold participate in any of the battles. Other than some of the necessary ones, Qing Shui's demonic beasts basically had no chance to show themselves. After all, Qing Shui was now a lot stronger than them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast, Hell Nightmare Beast, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, Dark Phoenix, and Long Zhu`er had all undergone form transformation. They now possessed a human's train of thought and consciousness, thus Qing Shui won't give them away. All of them had been his trusty companions and in the future, they would also be his most trusted aides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw that Qing Yan was feeling down. To him, there was nothing more important than his daughters' happiness. Little Gold was the demonic beast which Qing Shui had gotten the latest. They weren't very attached emotionally and his daughter wasn't an outsider to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui called out the Gold Dragon, the others were still very astonished. Right now, Little Gold's ability was still considered very terrifying. Despite so, it was very obedient to Qing Shui. However, Qing Yan didn't want it, "Father, Daughter understands what you're thinking. I don't need it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, "Are you afraid that if Father doesn't have the Gold Dragon, I'll get bullied outside?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father needs it more than me. I don't have much use of it." Qing Yan said a little unnaturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This Gold Dragon is too weak. I didn't let it out over the few years. Lass, have you forgotten that Father has many demonic beasts? I'm so much stronger compared to it. This Gold Dragon is also useful when you learn the formations in the future." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yan was still hesitating when Qing Shui took her hand and dripped a drop of her blood on the Gold Dragon's massive head. At the same time, Qing Shui embedded a seal into the Gold Dragon's mind so that it would forever be loyal and protective of Qing Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Qingzhuang watched from the side with a faint smile. This proud man would also need to go through a lot of efforts in order to give his daughter a gift.</span></p>
