 <p><strong>AST 1245 - Treasures, Yang Stone, Yang Pill, Nine Yang Pharmacopoeia, Spiritual Medicinal Beast</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed the path and slowly proceeded down the staircase. The staircase was a few meters long. Qing Shui summoned out the Jade Emperor Bee to help him find his path forward. It was always better to be safe than sorry. If anything bad was to happen, at least he would be prepared for it.</p>
 <p>The stone steps weren’t really that long. Very quickly, they had already reached the bottom. Deep down, Qing Shui also felt really excited about it as after all, this was the treasury which the Heaven Secret Academy gave him. He didn’t know what it contained but it shouldn’t be anything too bad.</p>
 <p>While thinking, Qing Shui walked towards the one and only huge hidden room within it. There was no sign of danger in the messages which the Jade Emperor Bee sent him. While Qing Shui was walking, he was also thinking about what he was looking forward to the most.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thought about this problem, he was stunned. The reason being that he already had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. A lot of his things came from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal but now, for a moment, he realized that he no longer had very high expectations for the things in the outside world. Even now, he wasn’t really as excited as he thought he would be. If there was something he really looked forward to, it would be to refine the strength within himself.</p>
 <p>The door of the hidden room here was left open. Hence, Qing Shui could already see a lot of the things inside it with just one glance. Most of what was here were some chests. The things left outside were all useless. Despite the treasury being about ten meters long and wide, there were very few things within.</p>
 <p>This instead made Qing Shui feel happy. This was because from his experiences so far, the more things they had put in here, the more things there would be which were useless. Only a minority of them could be considered to be decent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laid his hand on one of the chests closest to him. The chest was made out of a kind of jade. Since the chest was made of jade, there ought to be decent things contained within it. Other than that very valuable things, normally, the majority of the things contained within jade stones were medicinal ingredients.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly opened it and realized that there was only one layer within it. On top of it was a round hole about the size of a pigeon egg. Within it was contained sparkling and translucent medicinal pills. There was formidable spiritual qi being emitted from them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out one of them and closed the chest. The medicinal pill was slightly bigger than a person’s thumb. It was gold in color. There was fluorescent light circulating around it, giving people the feeling it was an elixir.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>One Yang Pill!</p>
 <p>Effect: One One Yang Pill can help increase the user’s strength by one sun (not the raw strength but the complete strength of the user), everyone could only consume it ten times throughout their lifetime. They could only consume one per year.</p>
 <p>One can use the One Yang Pill without the Two Yang and Three Yang Pills, they wouldn’t clash. Or more precisely, while consuming the One Yang pill, one could also use both the Two Yang and Three Yang Pills at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Oh, there is still Two Yang Pill, Three Yang Pill and so on…..” Qing Shui was stunned. Originally, he felt that the One Yang Pill would provide him a little help but if he could use it at the same time as Two Yang as well as Three Yang Pills, the result would still considered to be decent. It was just that Qing Shui didn’t know if there were Two or Three Yang Pills within the hidden room.</p>
 <p>Condition of use: Warrior has to possess strength of Grade One State Master or above.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about why the disciples in Aristocratic Clans were so powerful. Their clan inheritance itself was already powerful to begin with. If they were to add in a few more powerful medicinal pills, it would be hard even if they didn’t want to be powerful. For example, just like the One Yang Pill, a Grade One State Master could consume one and immediately ascend to a beginner Grade Three State Master.</p>
 <p>Of course, the people who could own such formidable medicinal pills were definitely powerful forces. Furthermore, it was safe to assume that only the geniuses from the clans could use them.</p>
 <p>The other clans might not have the One Yang Pill. But they would have other medicinal pills which might not necessarily be weaker than the One Yang Pill. They might even be able to match against the Two or Three Yang Pills.</p>
 <p>If we were to talk about merely the One Yang Pill, Qing Shui felt that it would provide little help for himself. The reason being that it didn’t increase one’s raw strength. If that was the stat it raised, it would have been more powerful. In fact, if it really helped raise raw strength, Qing Shui wouldn’t dare to eat it as he feared that his body might burst as a result.</p>
 <p>There were sixty of those pills in the chest. The One Yang Pill was definitely a formidable existence. The value of sixty of these was already something immeasurable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put the One Yang Pill back into the chest and immediately threw it into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui stopped looking. He immediately tossed all of the chests into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and left. On the way out he was very fast. He followed the path back to where he came from and swiftly shuttled through it. At the time when he came out, he didn’t run into those elderly men.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui reached home, it was already evening. He was surprised to find out that the girls were also there. It was truly convenient for them to take the rice now. But this time, Qing Shui made them prepare it instead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave them the flavorings as well as the rest of the ingredients. After that, he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>As for the girls, they could only start trying to cook. The beauties from heaven looked at each other dumbfoundedly inside the kitchen but luckily, Yan Jinyu had seen Qing Shui doing it before. In fact, she had also once also cooked before, it was just that the dishes she prepared were of the simplest kind. Also for Qing Sha, she has seen Qing Shui’s cooking the most. Hence, the girls began trying their best to prepare the dishes.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Qing Shui had already begun checking out the other boxes within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. There were around ten of them. Qing Shui opened up one of the other two Jade Stone chests and realized that there were medicinal pills which looked like One Yang Pill. They shared the same size and similar color. It was just that the aura emitted felt different. The ones here were slightly more powerful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart moved. He looked towards it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Two Yang Pill!</p>
 <p>Effect: One Two Yang pill can increase strength by two sun (Not raw but overall strength). Each person could only take ten throughout their lifetime and only one per year.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Two Yang Pill was consumed, it could be used together with One and Three Yang Pills.</p>
 <p>Condition of use: User’s strength has to be at least at or above Grade One State Master.</p>
 <p>Two Yang Pill, it really was the Two Yang Pill. Furthermore, it was exactly the same as the way he thought it would be. There were also around sixty of them within this box. Each row contained ten and there were six rows in total.</p>
 <p>He opened up the other Jade Stone Chest. This one was relatively bigger than the one before. Qing Shui looked into it and found there to be medicinal ingredients within the box. Furthermore, they were all especially precious ones. Even though there were only very few of each, they were quite valuable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui glanced over them and found out that they were all roughly ten thousand years of age.</p>
 <p>Following on, Qing Shui took a peek at the other chests.</p>
 <p>Yang Stone!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt really agitated. To his surprise, this piece of Yang Stone was as big as the heads of two adult men. Its coloration was an indication that its quality seemed to be even better. Qing Shui closed the chest. The old man had truly put a lot of capital into the presents he gave Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He continued opening another chest only to find seeds within it.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of seeds within it, Qing Shui looked towards them with his Heavenly Vision Technique and realized that they were seeds of Yang Grass and Yang Flame Flower.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart moved.</p>
 <p>Could it be the seeds of the medicinal herbs to refine One and Two Yang Pills?</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed the other chests which he had opened. The things here seemed to share relations with “Yang”. For example, Yang Stones, Yang Pills, Yang Flowers as well as Yang Grass.</p>
 <p>There were still the last two small chests. Both were only one foot in size. However, the quality of the chests were the best among those he took. This made Qing Shui really excited. He slowly opened up one of the small chests. The thing which appeared in front of him was an ancient book. On top of it was written a few simple and unadorned words “Nine Yang Pharmacopoeia”.</p>
 <p>Upon opening it, Qing Shui read it from the first page. They were all decent recipes. However, all of the recipes written in it basically required medicinal grass like Yang Grass. Towards the end, Qing Shui noticed the recipes for One Yang to Nine Yang Pills. There was nothing further.</p>
 <p>From those seeds and recipes, Qing Shui felt that this treasury was left behind by a powerful alchemist. However, because the person was restricted by certain situations or maybe, because of his personal influence, he could only refine the Two Yang Pill.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Qing Shui put down the recipes in his hands. This was because he felt that he would need a lot of years until he could refine medicines. What he meant by that was that the age of the medicinal herbs wasn’t something he could have at the moment. The medicinal pills he refined now all required spiritual medicine grade ingredients. Those would be at least three thousand years old. Only after three thousand years would the herb start to be considered the lowest grade spiritual medicine. And as for things like One Yang Pill, its requirements would be even higher. Even inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it would still require ten years in the outside world for it to be done.</p>
 <p>Hence, this made Qing Shui felt a bit gloomy. Nevertheless, he still felt really happy. After all, his current lifespan was really long. If he really ran out of ideas, it would still be fine if he had to wait for ten years.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened the last box with a complicated feeling only to find that it was also a book. On top of it was written “Beast of Spiritual Medicine”.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was confused. He took out some books and started flipping through them. While reading, a surprised look could constantly be seen on Qing Shui’s face. As it seemed, the Spiritual Medicinal Beast targeted specifically medicinal herbs. They were beasts that turned medicinal herbs into spiritual medicine.</p>
 <p>Spiritual Medicinal Beasts raked through the soil within the ground, making the soil within the medicinal farm be filled with spirituality. Some of them would pollinate the herbs whereas some would right away penetrate through the medicinal herbs. The main things were the demonic beasts within the soil of the medicinal farm and the pollinators. Only through changing the soil into a spiritual farm would the medicinal herbs be able to turn into spiritual grass. As for those being pollinated, they were mostly spiritual fruits and such.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued reading it and realized the formidable features of Spiritual Medicinal Beast. A Grade One Spiritual Medicinal Beast could reduce time by 10%. A Grade Two could reduce by 20% whereas a Grade Three could reduce it by 30%.</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Medicinal Beasts didn’t shorten the time. Instead, it helped raise the spiritual nature within the medicinal herbs. It was in another way considered shortening the time, the reason being that medicinal herbs would turn into spiritual medicine once it reached a particular time.</p>
 <p>There was also the Flower of Life and enourmous lotus within the pond inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The main point was how do one nurture the Spiritual Medicanal Beasts?</p>
 <p>The “Beast of Spiritual Medicine” was mainly used to nurture Spiritual Medicinal Beasts. The majority of Spiritual Medicinal Beasts didn’t have mighty combat prowess. Furthermore, their body size was very small. The reason being that they needed to rake the soil as well as nurture the medicinal herbs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a lot of targets for pollinating Spiritual Medicinal Beasts. For example, the Jade Emperor Bee as well as the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly. But for now, the main one Qing Shui needed to choose was one which could help change the quality of the soil.</p>
 <p>The soil within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was already considered to be really decent and powerful. If not, it wouldn’t be suitable for any plants to grow. After spending half a day deciding, Qing Shui spotted the Treasure Hunting Pig which was sleeping soundly in the corner.</p>
 <p>Its body still looked golden-bright and round as usual. It was a lovely and really likeable beast. It was best to turn this kind of Treasure Beast into Spiritual Medicinal Beast. Not only was it able to hunt for treasure. In terms of its size, it was also more suitable for the role. Furthermore, despite not having any combat power, the Treasure Hunting Beast’s resistance against attacks was extremely powerful. It could also pass through mountains, drill underground, cross rivers, pass through fire and even penetrate through things tougher than itself. This was also so that it could hunt for treasures.</p>
 <p>The Treasure Hunting Pig becoming a Spiritual Medicinal Beast would only benefit itself. After settling on which demonic beasts he wanted to feed, so long as he fed them with one Spiritual Beast Pill, he would have considered to have planted a seed of Spiritual Medicinal Beast within their bodies. If it was compatible with the demonic beasts, they would immediately ascend to Grade One Spiritual Medicinal Beast. Whereas if it was not compatible, the process would be really slow. They might not even end up a Spiritual Medicinal Beast.</p>
 <p>There was a recipe for Spiritual Beast Pill within the “Beast of Spiritual Medicine”. Furthermore, among the seeds, there were also medicinal herbs like these. However, Qing Shui remembered the box of medicinal herbs. He quickly opened it and looked into it.</p>
 <p>“As I thought, it’s the medicinal herbs listed in the recipe for Spiritual Beast Pill.” Qing Shui was unable to describe the surprise he was feeling right now. If he was to really nurture a Spiritual Medicinal Beast and used it along with the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. With his ability in refining medicines, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to refine the medicinal pills within the Nine Yang Pharmacopoeia.</p>
