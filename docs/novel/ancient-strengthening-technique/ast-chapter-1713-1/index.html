 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The provocation intents behind those words were far too strong. It would be fine if it was an ordinary person, but how could an ordinary person be able to come here in the first place? Moreover, Qing Shui was also able to sense the opponent's aura. This person was much weaker than Qing Shui. After all, during this period of time, the increment to his strength had basically placed him at the very top amongst those around his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still had confidence in himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm Qi Deng. I happened to pass by and thus came." The thin man looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh. Since you’re here, you're one of our guests." Qing Shui smiled and replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's intentions were also very clear. 'You had come uninvited, but since you're here, we'll treat you as a guest. However, you should also act like one.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people around them had started to murmur amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's the matter with that table? Why are they so undiscerning? They don't even care about what place this is. Aren't they courting death to be looking for trouble here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right. There are too many people like that. They really don't know any better just because they are a little stronger than normal."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Lord Guardian doesn't stoop to their level, but shouldn’t they learn to be a little more self-aware?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>

After all, Today was his son's baby shower and it would be best to keep the celebration in a happy mood. If there something were to happen, they could deal with it at a later time. Moreover, he really did not care about the other party nor did he feel that infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't know who the other party was and he was not interested in finding out. He didn't know why the opposite party was trying to find trouble for him. He didn’t have any recollection of meeting this man before. The other person must have been asked by someone else to do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of the disagreement with the Wavemoon Cavern previously. However, the people here shouldn't be a match for him and he didn't know why they had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right. We're guests. But you, as the host, aren't coming to offer a toast to everyone. Why is that? Are you looking down on us?" The thin and weak looking man continued speaking in an eccentric voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, everyone could tell that this man was here to cause troubles. Qing Shui frowned. He wasn't willing to disrupt the mood of the party, but that didn't mean that he was afraid of trouble. He looked at the man and continued to smile as he said, "We've never met before. There's no need to beat about the bush. Go on and answer me. Who sent you here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha. Who sent me here? Who do you think is capable of commanding me?" The thin and weak man laughed out loud with great vigor while his face was turning increasingly red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hahahaha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His laughter got even more louder and his face progressively red. Qing Shui sensed that the other party's breathing was messed up and his vitality was seeping away rapidly. Before Qing Shui could make a decision in time, the man's laughter suddenly came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now felt that something was wrong. Looking at the man who was now completely silent, before Qing Shui could say anything, the other people at the table suddenly stood up, "Young Master! Young Master! What's the matter?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now knew that this was a plot and he was the target. In this world of cultivators, everything depended on one's strength. Was there really a need for such a simple scheme like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui suddenly remembered what the man had said, "Who sent me here? Who do you think is capable of commanding me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's eyes narrowed. At this moment, a gentle-looking man at that table lifted his head and glared at Qing Shui, "You caused the death of our Young Master. You can wait for the Xuan Clan to come seeking revenge!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Clan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui remembered it. He was wondering what had happened. At first, it was the sudden engagement of Qing Hanye. It was enough trouble with the Watermoon Cavern, but it hadn't been long before he came into contact with the Wavemoon Cavern. Moreover, there had been some disagreements then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, there was the appearance of a Xuan Clan. The Xuan Clan was a unique existence in this ocean domain. A clan with an ancient legacy. It was said that their ancestor was a huge Xuan Snake that could engulf the Dragon Clan. Their clan had powerful blood flowing through them and had mysterious powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xuan Clan wouldn't lose out to the Watermoon Cavern and the Wavemoon Cavern. However, the people from the Xuan Clan were very vicious, just like actual venomous snakes. No one was willing to offend the Xuan Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't have much involvement with the Xuan Clan, nor had he met anyone from there before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Xuan Clan, I've never met anyone from the Xuan Clan before in my life. Are you guys doing this intentionally?" Qing Shui bellowed out unhappily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew this very clearly but had also said this out loud so that the people around them would know. Using the power of words to make it such that the rumors would be more in his favor. Qing Shui's principle was such that if people didn't offend him, he wouldn't do anything back to them. One must always be reasonable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Intentionally? You’re saying that we're intentionally making a joke with our Young Master's life? With our Young Master dead, do you think that we'll be able to keep our lives? Brothers, let's fight it out with him. He's the one who caused the death of our Young Master! We must avenge our Young Master!" The gentle-looking middle-aged man said, seemingly angry. However, Qing Shui could clearly see the coldness and serenity in the depth of this man's eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘There's something wrong with this guy.’ Qing Shui thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then do explain for me. How on earth did I cause the death of your Young Master?" Qing Shui boldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gentle-looking man eventually looked toward the wine the dead man had drunk. Then, as if he had been prepared for this, he took out a silver needle and placed it into the bowl. The silver needle instantly glistered in a brilliant black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There was poison!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people in the surroundings broke out into a commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You said it yourself. What feud did our Xuan Clan have against you? To think that you would stoop down to such low means to deal with our Young Master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the man finished his words, the body of the thin and weak man had already started to turn black. It was the sign of a strong poison.</span></p>

There were no changes to Qing Shui's expressions. However, it was effective. Right now, Qing Shui was able to guess that this man was the one who had poisoned the guy.</span></p>

He seemed tall and powerful, but also vicious. A middle-aged man was next to him and kept on talking about something to the old man.</span></p>

The rest were all young-looking males. Of course, It was likely that those young men were all very much older compared to Qing Shui.</span></p>
