 <p><strong>Chapter 512 Mother, I Have Became Trash Again, Shi Qingzhuang’s Tears.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 512 - Mother, I Have Became Trash Again, Shi Qingzhuang’s Tears</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out a few vats of wine from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Three generations of the Qing Clan drank till they were red in the face, however some of the lads became reserved when they saw the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, even so, they still quietly gave Qing Shui a thumbs up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could only smile bitterly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Zi’s son, Qing Chang, was almost 4 years old already, he looked dignified and strong, looking especially cute and mischievous. He did not find Qing Shui unfamiliar when he saw him, instead, he went to sit on Qing’s Shui lap.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle, is she my aunt?” the young lad’s immature voice caused everyone at the table to become silent and look at Qing Shui. Especially Qing You, Qing Hui, Qing Shi, Qing Shan and a few others; they were all snickering at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not even have to think to know that these few people had instigated the young lad to ask him that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not answer the question, instead he used a piece of lobster to stuff the young lad’s mouth, this caused Qing You and the others to feel disappointed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The was no change on Qing Shui’s face, but Huoyun Liu-Li and Mingyue Gelou’s expression had caused Qing Shui to discover something. It wasn’t only the two girls that stared at Qing Shui but a few other girls as well, they had an expression of heartache and worry in their eyes, it was different from the past.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Yi noticed Qing He staring dumbly at Qing Shui, it seemed that she had realized something, something on Qing Shui’s expression had caused her earlier suspicions to become more certain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A mother knows her son well. Very soon Qing Yi was certain of some things, but she did not say it then. She only urged the girls, who had not eaten much, to eat more, the reactions of the few girls had led Qing Qi to be even surer of her guess.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The meal was still being consumed in a lively manner!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, accompany your mother for a walk!” Qing Yi smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, I have some things to tell mother as well.” Qing Shui smiled back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The girls had already left and went upstairs!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui followed Qing Yi to the outside of the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. It was slightly past evening and the summer evening air had already cooled down. A strong wind blew the tree branches around, causing the birds to fly away. There were many people on the road since it was evening; there were many young couples holding hands, speaking sweet nothings to each other. There were also parents bringing their children out to play…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui really enjoyed these feelings, even his restless heart had calmed down, Qing Shui knew that all this was because of the person beside him, the person he called mother.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, do you not wish to tell mother the truth?” Qing Yi turned her head to look at her maturing son.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How could it be? What does mother want to know?” Qing Shui laughed. As he laughed, Qing Shui considered whether to tell his mother. Regarding the part where he only had three years left, he would not tell her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I do not know what happened to you, but I noticed that the girls and your second uncle had a strange expression when they looked at you.” Qing Yi stared at Qing Shui without blinking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, the Qing Clan could now be counted to as having Xiantian cultivators. As long as one reached the Xiantian realm, they would be able to sense the condition of the body of a weaker person using their Spiritual sense. Qing Shui knew he could not hide his conditions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, I have become trash again.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not sure how he felt when he said this sentence, it was a forlorn feeling, losing something you had was worse than not having it at all in the first place.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi was stunned, but soon she smiled and softly said, “Are you feeling upset? Upset that you can no longer do certain things for certain people anymore?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi in astonishment. Actually, Qing Shui did not have any wild ambitions. Albeit, he had been willing to help Yiye Jiange to trample on the Lion King's Ridge, as will as Lin Zhanhan’s matter. If not, Qing Shui’s wish would be to tour around the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even without strength, Qing Shui looked forward to life, even a very simple life. To find a person he liked and lead a simple life in the Qing Clan like an ordinary person, having a son or daughter would be nice as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, both of Qing Shui’s hopes were extravagant hopes. With three years of life left, Qing Shui did not want to hurt any girls, but was he able to save those that he’d had already hurt?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, how did you know?” Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi in astonishment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, the people who truly loves you, will not change because of this, they also do not seek any benefits, you should know this, you have been doing it.” Qing Yi stretched her hands out to massage Qing Shui’s head, a warm feeling filled Qing Shui’s heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Indeed, Qing Shui had thought about when he’d helped Yiye Jiange, Lin Zhanhan… and the rest, Qing Shui had not expected to gain anything, maybe that was how they’d felt as well…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I was originally going to search for a Xiantian Golden Pellet for mother, If only I had one more year of time, such a pity…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It does not matter how long I live for, the most important thing is to live a happy life, a meaningful life. The happiest thing in my life is that I have a son like you and a daughter like Qing Qing. If you and Qing Qing are not happy, then so what if I life for 500 years, I might as well die early.” Qing Yi smiled while holding Qing Shui’s hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every mother was the noblest, every father was the hero in every child’s heart…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By the time they’d gotten back to the Qing Clan, the sky was already dark, but when Qing Shui and Qing Yi went past the living room, everyone was there, only the Misty Hall Palace Mistress and Huang Qing were not there.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, Qing Yi did not ask him too much earlier because she knew when they got home, there would be many Qing Clan members asking about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Is something wrong with my eyes?” Qing He asked Qing Shui, eyes full of worry.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, What you see is real, I have once again become the person mocked by everybody.” Qing Shui looked at Qing He and the other Qing Can members in pain as he slowly said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Except for the three girls, everyone was stunned. Everyone was at a loss for words as they looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, you are just joking with us right?” Qing Bei looked at Qing Shui with red eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“His meridians were shattered. He is not lying to us.” Qing He sighed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, who did it? I will go kill him.” Qing You stood up in anger, flexing his muscles, he had become even more taller and sturdier than before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Martial Saint!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two words caused Qing You to be at a loss for words!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, not having my cultivation is good. From now on, I won’t go out, after a few days I will go back to Qing Village. I will lead a leisurely lifestyle, I am tired of running around.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone was depressed, but they all consoled Qing Shui, not a single person blamed him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words lead others to feel that he had suffered a terrible setback and just wished to heal in peace, but who knew that Qing Shui only had a few years left to live…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I will return to Qing Village with you.” Qing Qing smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the sister he had not seen for a long time and nodded his head, “Sure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you want to hear the want happened when I was outside?” Qing Shui knew that it was a good thing, they would find out everything. Now, even if he could not say it, they would not ask.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before they had even asked, Qing Shui started to slowly tell them about the things that happened to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The second day, Qing Shui woke up really early, but Qing Shui hadn’t had morning practice for a very long time already!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Perhaps it was a habit that Qing Shui woke up early. When he went to the courtyard, he discovered that the three generations of the Qing Clan were gathered there; Qing Shui saw Qing Qing in the distance practicing a familiar technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Form!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled as he watched, she already had the spirit of it. If her strength could increase a little, it would achieve an amplifying effect. Just a little more strength would achieve this effect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Vitality Pill!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of the Tiger Vitality Pill he had prepared for them, it was a pity that he could no longer refine it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The three generations of the Qing Clan were given one each, except Qing He. The amount of strength increased was insignificant for Xiantian cultivators. More importantly was that Qing Shui could no longer refine it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One pellet of Tiger Vitality Pill, as well as the fruits he had prepared, would directly increase Qing Qing’s strength, as far as she was concerned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When it was late in the morning, Qing Shui saw someone he did not know how to deal with.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A person dressed in a fiery red dress, that was not only not tacky but also brought out a cold and elegant feel, walked to the front of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Coming!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This reply caused Qing Shui to think of that lady on the Ice Crane, the person had looked even colder than Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She must not have known that I have become trash…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let us walk together!” Qing Shui raised his head to look at the beautiful girl, a cold beauty, the one he’d had the earliest relations with.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang quietly agreed and went with Qing Shui to the Qing Clan medicine garden.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As time went by, they’d become a bit distant. Qing Shui felt that he couldn’t be apart from Shi Qingzhuang for too long, once that happened he would feel especially stifling. Each time would require Qing Shui to take brazen actions before it got better. But that only got her to be better to Qing Shui by a little, she would smile sometimes, that smile was like flowers blossoming, ice melting or a beautiful rainbow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If we were to get married now, what would you say?” Qing Shui said lightly. Back then she said to give her 5 years of time, that time had already passed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What I said before will naturally be done,” Shi Qingzhuang said calmly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If I can only live for another 5 years, will you marry me? Let’s not even consider that condition.” Qing Shui did not look at Shi Qingzhuang, he only said that casually.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang’s delicate body trembled, eye’s full of disbelief and looked at Qing Shui: “How could it be! How could it be…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quietly became gloomy. “Shi Qingzhuang is a Xiantian cultivator, she can see that my meridians are destroyed. In addition, she is intelligent, she should be able to guess what I meant earlier.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt silly, regardless of how worried she was, this woman's mouth was very tight, she normally would not say anything to others, much less his matters.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You saw through it.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly and the tear-stained face beauty in front of him. Despite the normally strong exterior of the girl in front of him, she was actually so delicate.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How could it be? Qing Shui, please... tell me that all this is fake.”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui really enjoyed these feelings, even his restless heart had calmed down, Qing Shui knew that all this was because of the person beside him, the person he called mother.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, do you not wish to tell mother the truth?” Qing Yi turned her head to look at her maturing son.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How could it be? What does mother want to know?” Qing Shui laughed. As he laughed, Qing Shui considered whether to tell his mother. Regarding the part where he only had three years left, he would not tell her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I do not know what happened to you, but I noticed that the girls and your second uncle had a strange expression when they looked at you.” Qing Yi stared at Qing Shui without blinking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, the Qing Clan could now be counted to as having Xiantian cultivators. As long as one reached the Xiantian realm, they would be able to sense the condition of the body of a weaker person using their Spiritual sense. Qing Shui knew he could not hide his conditions.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, I have become trash again.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not sure how he felt when he said this sentence, it was a forlorn feeling, losing something you had was worse than not having it at all in the first place.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi was stunned, but soon she smiled and softly said, “Are you feeling upset? Upset that you can no longer do certain things for certain people anymore?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi in astonishment. Actually, Qing Shui did not have any wild ambitions. Albeit, he had been willing to help Yiye Jiange to trample on the Lion King's Ridge, as will as Lin Zhanhan’s matter. If not, Qing Shui’s wish would be to tour around the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even without strength, Qing Shui looked forward to life, even a very simple life. To find a person he liked and lead a simple life in the Qing Clan like an ordinary person, having a son or daughter would be nice as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But now, both of Qing Shui’s hopes were extravagant hopes. With three years of life left, Qing Shui did not want to hurt any girls, but was he able to save those that he’d had already hurt?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, how did you know?” Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi in astonishment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, the people who truly loves you, will not change because of this, they also do not seek any benefits, you should know this, you have been doing it.” Qing Yi stretched her hands out to massage Qing Shui’s head, a warm feeling filled Qing Shui’s heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Indeed, Qing Shui had thought about when he’d helped Yiye Jiange, Lin Zhanhan… and the rest, Qing Shui had not expected to gain anything, maybe that was how they’d felt as well…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I was originally going to search for a Xiantian Golden Pellet for mother, If only I had one more year of time, such a pity…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It does not matter how long I live for, the most important thing is to live a happy life, a meaningful life. The happiest thing in my life is that I have a son like you and a daughter like Qing Qing. If you and Qing Qing are not happy, then so what if I life for 500 years, I might as well die early.” Qing Yi smiled while holding Qing Shui’s hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every mother was the noblest, every father was the hero in every child’s heart…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By the time they’d gotten back to the Qing Clan, the sky was already dark, but when Qing Shui and Qing Yi went past the living room, everyone was there, only the Misty Hall Palace Mistress and Huang Qing were not there.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, Qing Yi did not ask him too much earlier because she knew when they got home, there would be many Qing Clan members asking about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Is something wrong with my eyes?” Qing He asked Qing Shui, eyes full of worry.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, What you see is real, I have once again become the person mocked by everybody.” Qing Shui looked at Qing He and the other Qing Can members in pain as he slowly said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Except for the three girls, everyone was stunned. Everyone was at a loss for words as they looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, you are just joking with us right?” Qing Bei looked at Qing Shui with red eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“His meridians were shattered. He is not lying to us.” Qing He sighed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, who did it? I will go kill him.” Qing You stood up in anger, flexing his muscles, he had become even more taller and sturdier than before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Martial Saint!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two words caused Qing You to be at a loss for words!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, not having my cultivation is good. From now on, I won’t go out, after a few days I will go back to Qing Village. I will lead a leisurely lifestyle, I am tired of running around.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone was depressed, but they all consoled Qing Shui, not a single person blamed him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words lead others to feel that he had suffered a terrible setback and just wished to heal in peace, but who knew that Qing Shui only had a few years left to live…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I will return to Qing Village with you.” Qing Qing smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the sister he had not seen for a long time and nodded his head, “Sure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you want to hear the want happened when I was outside?” Qing Shui knew that it was a good thing, they would find out everything. Now, even if he could not say it, they would not ask.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Before they had even asked, Qing Shui started to slowly tell them about the things that happened to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The second day, Qing Shui woke up really early, but Qing Shui hadn’t had morning practice for a very long time already!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Perhaps it was a habit that Qing Shui woke up early. When he went to the courtyard, he discovered that the three generations of the Qing Clan were gathered there; Qing Shui saw Qing Qing in the distance practicing a familiar technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Form!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled as he watched, she already had the spirit of it. If her strength could increase a little, it would achieve an amplifying effect. Just a little more strength would achieve this effect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Vitality Pill!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of the Tiger Vitality Pill he had prepared for them, it was a pity that he could no longer refine it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The three generations of the Qing Clan were given one each, except Qing He. The amount of strength increased was insignificant for Xiantian cultivators. More importantly was that Qing Shui could no longer refine it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One pellet of Tiger Vitality Pill, as well as the fruits he had prepared, would directly increase Qing Qing’s strength, as far as she was concerned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When it was late in the morning, Qing Shui saw someone he did not know how to deal with.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A person dressed in a fiery red dress, that was not only not tacky but also brought out a cold and elegant feel, walked to the front of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Coming!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This reply caused Qing Shui to think of that lady on the Ice Crane, the person had looked even colder than Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“She must not have known that I have become trash…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let us walk together!” Qing Shui raised his head to look at the beautiful girl, a cold beauty, the one he’d had the earliest relations with.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang quietly agreed and went with Qing Shui to the Qing Clan medicine garden.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As time went by, they’d become a bit distant. Qing Shui felt that he couldn’t be apart from Shi Qingzhuang for too long, once that happened he would feel especially stifling. Each time would require Qing Shui to take brazen actions before it got better. But that only got her to be better to Qing Shui by a little, she would smile sometimes, that smile was like flowers blossoming, ice melting or a beautiful rainbow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If we were to get married now, what would you say?” Qing Shui said lightly. Back then she said to give her 5 years of time, that time had already passed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What I said before will naturally be done,” Shi Qingzhuang said calmly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If I can only live for another 5 years, will you marry me? Let’s not even consider that condition.” Qing Shui did not look at Shi Qingzhuang, he only said that casually.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang’s delicate body trembled, eye’s full of disbelief and looked at Qing Shui: “How could it be! How could it be…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quietly became gloomy. “Shi Qingzhuang is a Xiantian cultivator, she can see that my meridians are destroyed. In addition, she is intelligent, she should be able to guess what I meant earlier.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt silly, regardless of how worried she was, this woman's mouth was very tight, she normally would not say anything to others, much less his matters.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You saw through it.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly and the tear-stained face beauty in front of him. Despite the normally strong exterior of the girl in front of him, she was actually so delicate.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How could it be? Qing Shui, please... tell me that all this is fake.”</p>
