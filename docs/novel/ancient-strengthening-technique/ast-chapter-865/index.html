 <p><strong>AST 865 - She Has the Mystical Connection Divine Sword?</strong></p>
 <p>"This is the tenth time" the lady said softly.</p>
 <p>"How often do you guys enter Sky Penetrating Mountains?" Qing Shui asked casually.</p>
 <p>"This is not fixed. Most of the time, we would enter twice a year at most, with no fixed timing. We just happened to be going in this time and you had the same intention," the lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>As they carried on with their casual chat, they arrived by a river which was only a 100 meters wide and about 100 meters deep. It was so clear that one could see the bottom of the river and the gushing sound of the water was very calming.</p>
 <p>There were plenty of fish and prawns in the water and since the water was very clear, Qing Shui had wanted to catch some. He decided that the menu for the night was to eat fish and drink fish soup.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Pure Gold Fishing Rod and looked at the sky. Although it was going to be dark soon, it was not very late yet. Moreover, if he were to use the Pure Gold Fishing Rod, he might be able to fish out something good. And even if he couldn't, at least the fish and fish soup for dinner would be settled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held the fishing rod and looked at the lady from Mu Clan, "It's not late yet. How about we catch some fish?"</p>
 <p>"Alright, I haven't seen someone fishing before." The lady seemed to be looking with great interest at the fishing rod Qing Shui was holding.</p>
 <p>The two of them found a spot and Qing Shui tossed in the fishing line.</p>
 <p>Looking at this small river, although Qing Shui knew the great power of the Pure Gold Fishing Rod, he had not held much expectation that anything good would come of it. The water here was so clear that he could see the bottom with one look. Therefore, he shouldn't be able to fish out any treasures.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he had not planned to fish out any treasures. He only wanted to catch fish and prawns.</p>
 <p>"It's moving!"</p>
 <p>The lady saw that a fish had bitten the hook and said happily.</p>
 <p>However, after the lady said that, the fish which had bitten the hook escaped.</p>
 <p>"Ah, I'm sorry." The lady looked at Qing Shui apologetically.</p>
 <p>"It's nothing. This is very normal." Qing Shui smiled to indicate that it was not much.</p>
 <p>On the second attempt, he successfully fished up a Green Tailed Fish which was about one foot in size. The lady from Mu Clan looked from the side, not making a sound but joy was reflected on her face.</p>
 <p>She was usually very busy or rather, she had been busy since she was young. Although she had outstanding talent, she still needed to spend a large amount of time on her cultivation. Therefore, she had spent all of her time cultivating.</p>
 <p>Moreover, she still had a powerful treasure. Otherwise, the rate of her progress would not be as fast.</p>
 <p>She had eaten a good share of fish and prawns in her life but this was the first time that she had seen someone fishing from so close up. She felt that this was very new and she even had an urge to attempt it herself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't look at the lady from Mu Clan but he could sense faintly the ripples in her heart. He could easily guess that this lady should have gone through a lot. If she hadn't, she would not have reached the level she was at today. It seemed like she was so busy that she did not even have the time to fish.</p>
 <p>This was not an exaggeration. Not everyone could have a Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal like he did and could at most rely on medicine or other items to make better use of their time.</p>
 <p>He then continued to successfully fish up three Green Tailed Fish, five crabs which were one foot in size and a lobster that was the size of his palm. Qing Shui turned to see that Mu Clan's lady was looking at his fishing rod.</p>
 <p>"Do you want to give it a go?" Qing Shui smiled and said. He could tell that the lady had wanted to try but couldn't bring it up.</p>
 <p>"Alright!" The lady said happily.</p>
 <p>Receiving Qing Shui's Pure Gold Fishing Rod, after listening to Qing Shui's explanation of how it was used, she then started to fish.</p>
 <p>When she fished up her first fish, she was extremely happy. This was the first time that Qing Shui had seen her with such a smile after having seen her so many times. It was a really happy smile. When a dignified lady smiled, it would be so graceful that one would be stunned.</p>
 <p>"I've managed to catch something!" There was a grace and a hint of charm in her voice.</p>
 <p>The lady's tone had an unconcealed joy to it, as if she was a kid who had received a toy she liked. Qing Shui smiled and watched from the side. He didn't know what he was feeling now but he was happy to see the lady being happy as well. It was a very simple feeling, just like the spreading of happiness. For example, when you're with a few people, when someone smiles at you, you'll smile back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a bucket and then started to clean up the fish, prawns and crabs.</p>
 <p>The lady seemed to like fishing and only after Qing Shui told her that it was enough did she turn to see that the whole bucket was full. She smiled and brought back the fishing rod, handing it back to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put away the Pure Gold Fishing Rod, lifted up the bucket and headed back with the lady. This was the first time the Pure Gold Fishing Rod had not fished out something good but it was within his expectations.</p>
 <p>If he were able to fish out good items and treasures regardless of the place, then Qing Shui wouldn't have to do anything but to go fishing every day.</p>
 <p>On the way back, he found some dried wood and started a fire directly when they arrived at the tent. There was roasted fish, fish soup, as well as things like roasted prawns and crabs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dare to say that his culinary skills were top notch but with the outstanding ingredients and his skill, he had not come across anyone who could do it better than him. It was also fun to be making some food in his free time, especially when he was at home, cooking for the women he liked and for his children. It was a great happiness and enjoyment.</p>
 <p>When that intoxicating fragrance flowed out, even those old fogeys couldn't help but twitch their noses and stare at the steaming fish soup, roasted fish...</p>
 <p>They had eaten a lot of fish before and while this 'fish type' was quite good, it could only be considered above average. However, this fragrance was even better than the best top grade fish they had eaten before.</p>
 <p>There were more than twenty of them and each of them had brought their own utensils. Qing Shui was the last in the line and he finished up a huge serving of fish, prawns and other food.</p>
 <p>Even the lady from the Mu Clan ate a roasted fish and drank a bowl of fish soup. Although she was considered to have eaten the least amongst the people here, she knew that this was the one time she had eaten the most and she still had a craving for more.</p>
 <p>"This is the best food this old man has eaten in my life. Haha, I wouldn't have any regrets even if I were to die in the Sky Penetrating Mountains this time," an old man finished up the last mouthful of his fish soup and said happily.</p>
 <p>"Seventh Uncle, you're still young. There's still plenty chances in the future. Don't be thinking otherwise," a middle-aged man looked weirdly at the old man and said.</p>
 <p>"Rascal, you enjoy eating even more than me. Don't think that I have no idea what you're planning. Go tell that to the lass." The old man clearly didn't fall into the trap.</p>
 <p>"This is really considered a world grade delicacy. The spiritual energy in Eastern Victory Divine Continent is very strong and I've also eaten quite a lot of good food but to think that an ordinary Green Tailed Fish could taste this good. The skill of those imperial chefs are dogshit when compared to this young man's," an old man said.</p>
 <p>"Old Eight, we're eating. Can you be more civilized?"</p>
 <p>"Cough cough..."</p>
 <p>Mu Clan's lady was next to Qing Shui. Maybe it was because they were closer in age and thus they just naturally stood next to each other with no other thoughts. However, to other people, this looked like a entirely different scene.</p>
 <p>It was because many people realized that the two of them looked very harmonious or rather, they seemed to be a good match when they were standing together. It was a feeling they gave off. This young man was very mature and hid a terrifying power. He was also giving off an indescribable feeling.</p>
 <p>After the meal, it was still early. The old men started to gather around in groups to chat. They were brothers, partners and companions who had been working together for many years. They had great rapport and strong relationships. It was a true brotherhood.</p>
 <p>Therefore, they had endless topics to chat about.</p>
 <p>Mu Clan's lady had returned to her tent. Qing Shui looked at the sky and greeted the others before he entered his tent. He then went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>However, before he did that, he called out the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>This way, if someone was looking for him, he could be notified.</p>
 <p>His Heart of Roc was already at the large success stage but the Roc Spreading Wings was still at the small success stage and was still far away from attaining the large success stage. His abilities were improving rapidly but it still required a very long period of time. For each technique to reach the greatest height, it would take a tremendous amount of time. Moreover, Qing Shui was cultivating over ten techniques. If he didn't have the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he wouldn't be able to afford to do so.</p>
 <p>Thousand Crane Slash!</p>
 <p>This technique had already reached the large success stage and as he swung his hands, three pairs of palm shadows attacked at the same time. This was the prowess of the Thousand Crane Slash. It was just like the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, just that one technique emphasized focused attacks while the other was for dispersed attacks, both of which had their own advantages. However, the current prowess of the Thousand Crane Slash was still not comparable to the Six Waves.</p>
 <p>The concentrated attacks of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm had high damage and could be used against people with powerful defences. On the other hand, the Thousand Crane Slash's dispersed attacks, when used against people stronger than him, especially those with defences stronger than his attacks, would be basically useless.</p>
 <p>Unless the palm shadows could attack the opponent's vital spots.</p>
 <p>Thousand Hammer Technique!</p>
 <p>Roc Spreading Wings!</p>
 <p>Refining demon!</p>
 <p>Talisman Drawing!</p>
 <p>Drawing the [Hundred Forms of the Tiger]!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui woke up very early and walked toward the river. He was going to have his morning practice there but before he arrived, he could hear the sound of the swinging of swords. After walking further, he saw the lady dancing with the sword at the river bed,</p>
 <p>She was still wearing a golden colored pleated dress but Qing Shui knew that it was not the same one she was wearing before since the spiritual aura on it was different.</p>
 <p>The lady had a golden colored longsword in her hands and what had astonished Qing Shui was the glow and the powerful spiritual energy on the golden colored sword which was over three feet in length. It was as if the sword was able to form a Divine Connection.</p>
 <p>Mystical Connection Divine Sword！</p>
 <p>To think that it was the "Mystical Connection Divine Sword"! At first glance, the name of the sword slipped out from Qing Shui's mouth. Although the grades of the treasure which he knew of from his previous life was not accurate, this sword was definitely the best one Qing Shui has seen so far.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder that this lady could lead Mu Clan to the Sky Penetrating Mountains. This "Mystical Connection Divine Sword" definitely played a huge role.</p>
 <p>Another thing was that this Mystical Connection Divine Sword was different from the one Qing Shui knew about. The one he knew of was only seven inches long and was hidden in the body, linked to the owner in the heart. When required, it would release a stream of golden light, locking the enemy and killing them without any notice.</p>
 <p>In the world of the nine continents, everything he knew could only act as references. After all, only the things that he has come across whilst working his way through this world were real.</p>
 <p>And just then, the lady's longsword flew toward Qing Shui, its sword Qi like a rainbow and its speed was extremely fast. This made Qing Shui tense up. He took a step to the left and then two steps backward, dodging this sword.</p>
 <p>The lady's eyes lit up as she darted over, grabbed the Mystical Connection Divine Sword and once again stabbed toward Qing Shui. Each of her sword attacks had an indescribable rhythm, as if they were alive.</p>
 <p>They were really connected to her heart.</p>
