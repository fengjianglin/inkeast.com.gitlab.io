 <p><strong>AST 1207 - Disciples, the two girls arrive </strong></p>
 <p>The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal… The reason why it got upgraded in the past was due to Yin-Yang Union. But later on, despite the Yin-Yang Union taking place once again, it still didn’t manage to ascend in grade. Hence, this phenomenon kind of made him rethink what he used to believe in</p>
 <p>If that method didn’t work, Qing Shui really didn’t know what else would make the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal ascend in grade. He was laying down on the couch in the courtyard pondering over it.</p>
 <p>It was already late autumn and soon going to be winter. The sun in the sky felt warm and bright, as it shone on his body, he felt warm and comfortable.</p>
 <p>So far, Qing Shui still didn’t know what the girl’s name was. However, she had already started showing an expression which seemed as if she regretted parting with him. It was just like how a girl behaved around her father or rather, a kind of reluctance a sister had with her older brother. Qing Shui was very happy. This was also an improvement. He hoped that she would become happy.</p>
 <p>The girl’s strength was also improving significantly during this month. Not only that, she was even growing taller. The meridians and bones within her body were also undergoing changes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Constitution Nurturing Acupuncture played a huge role in boosting her cultivation. The Taichi which the girl cultivated had completely toppled over Qing Shui’s knowledge of it. However, he couldn’t really change anything at the moment. She had already walked up a different road of Taichi.</p>
 <p>Within these twenty days, the girl became Qing Shui’s apprentice. It was likely that she had already thought things through. This was the first apprentice which Qing Shui took in in the true sense. They carried out the ceremony very formally with people from Yan Clan as the witnesses.</p>
 <p>The energy of the Blood Terminator Bead could aid her in breaking through all the way up to being a beginner Grade Three State Master. Her current fighting strength however was already really terrifying, it was not something that could be measured with an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>She had already achieved so much despite being only sixteen… In the future, there would definitely be no limit in her potential to grow. Qing Shui wanted to see if she could find the good fortune which belong to her to achieve more after bringing her to the Heaven Secret Academy.</p>
 <p>But as he thought about her personality and the fact that he took her in as his apprentice, he shook his head. It should be very hard for her to learn things from other people now. Who would want to take her in? Even though she was incomparably talented, she had always distanced herself from other people, this was the biggest existing obstacle.</p>
 <p>“Master!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened his eyes and saw the girl standing beside him with a cup of tea. He smiled and took it, “Let me do these kinds of things. You can do it for me when I am old.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pointed at the wooden chair opposite him and told her to sit down.</p>
 <p>During this time, the Blood Terminator Bead within her body awakened, causing her strength to significantly increase. Her Taichi was also already at the Small Success Stage. Even though her body was really powerful, her footwork was extremely messy. Her ability to fight all relied on the baleful aura and fierce strength. Hence, Qing Shui felt that he could start teaching her other stuff now.</p>
 <p>The reason why he didn’t do so earlier was because he wanted her to focus on cultivating Taichi Fist. It was all so that the Taichi fist could reach its small success stage and suppress all the baleful aura within her body.</p>
 <p>It was just that he had never expected Taichi to completely change its nature once it went into her hands. Nevertheless, they could still suppress the baleful aura within her body. From the beginning, Qing Shui did everything just for this, now, he had already accomplished what he wanted.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui began teaching the girl footwork. Deer Cantering and Ghostly Steps. Qing Shui felt that the Ghostly Steps suited her very well. Of course, there was still the Duality Steps since it was the most suitable for Taichi Fist. Of course, he taught her through the relevant stages. From Origin to Duality, then from Duality to Four Phases before finally reaching Eight Trigrams.</p>
 <p>Hence, both the Four Phases Steps and Eight Trigram Steps were made more suitable for Taichi. It was just that for now, the only one she could learn was the Duality Steps. As for the Origin Step, it was the basic.</p>
 <p>The girl had supreme talent for learning martial arts. If the Blood Terminator Bead was similar to an inheritance, they could have immediately done strength infusion. But now, the things she cultivated were taught by Qing Shui. Despite this, she was still improving at a godly pace.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui planned to visit Yu Ruyan in Southern Sea, they showed up. Furthermore, on this day, people from Yan Clan were also at Firecloud Blacksmith Store. Yan Yangchen and Yan Leng’s wounds had all completely healed.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu, the Seventh Princess and even the Fifth Princess were here. Yan Jinyu and Yan Yangzhao knew about the girls Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan. The others on the other hand, didn’t know. It was just that at the moment when they saw the two girls, they as though even their breaths were stolen away..</p>
 <p>Upon knowing that Yu Ruyan was Qing Shui’s wife. All of them felt incomparably weird. They all already knew that Qing Shui already had an extreme beauty from the portrait, not only that but he loved her all the way to his core. Now, yet another extremely beautiful wife appeared.</p>
 <p>Without noticing, the emotions of the Seventh Princess once again dipped down.</p>
 <p>The stronger and more powerful a girl was, the more proud they would feel. It was an arrogance which originated from their moral character. The same thing applied to Seventh Princess. She didn’t understand why such an outstanding woman would want to share a man with other women.</p>
 <p>They didn’t know the story of Qing Shui and his girls. Hence, they had some trouble understanding it. Or rather, the Seventh Princess was unable to completely understand Qing Shui now.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw Yu Ruyan, he felt incomparably happy. He ignored the people present and immediately went forward to hug her. At the moment when he saw the beauty Tantai Xuan, he remembered the things which happened in the past and greeted her awkwardly.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of people here. Even the Seventh Princess knew about Tantai Xuan. Everyone was chit chatting happily.</p>
 <p>Like usual, the girl ignored everyone. Qing Shui introduced her to the others, when he mentioned about Yu Ruyan, the girl politely called Yu Ruyan master’s wife.</p>
 <p>Everyone noticed this was the first time the girl talked to someone other than Qing Shui. They immediately knew that she spoke because of him.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan came. Yan Yangchi and the others only stayed for a while before leaving. The girl on the other hand, went back to her room. They wanted to leave some time for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The three were in the courtyard. It was now late noon. They were having tea while talking about the things which had happened recently. Actually, when they first arrived, Qing Shui could already feel the strength of the two girls had improved rapidly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would often feel unnatural when facing Tantai Xuan. Last time, it was almost as if she fled. Upon seeing her this time, he could recall it fairly easy. Qing Shui didn’t even know why she came again.</p>
 <p>“You have such a huge reputation now. To think that as soon as we reached the inner castle and tried to listen for news about you we didn’t even have to try and we already managed to find this place.” Tantai Xuan smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>But whenever Qing Shui looked at her, she would unintentionally avoid his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Really?” Qing Shui asked a bit shocked.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, we heard so many things about you along the way,” Yu Ruyan smiled and carried on the topic.</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah, Ruyan, I have heard news about Di Chen.” Qing Shui felt the need to tell her.</p>
 <p>“Oh, then that’s great. When will you be able to find Sister Chen?” Yu Ruyan asked happily.</p>
 <p>She was sincerely happy.</p>
 <p>“She was seen by Eldest Princess from Great Yu Dynasty three years ago when she was in Divine Might Dynasty. For now, I don’t know if she’s still there.”</p>
 <p>“Divine Might Dynasty? That’s a Grade Four Dynasty,” Tan Taixuan said.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, a very powerful dynasty.”</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah, Qing Shui, what are you planning then?” Yu Ruyan asked Qing SHui.</p>
 <p>“I will be joining Heaven Secret Academy at the latest after the new year. After building a reputation there, I will think of a way to go to Divine Might Dynasty to look for Di Chen,” Qing Shui told Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“You intend to join Heaven Secret Academy?”</p>
 <p>The two girls were really shocked.</p>
 <p>Anyone would be shocked about it. The requirements to join Heaven Secret Academy were very high. One would at least need to possess the strength a State Master. Not only that, they would also need someone to introduce them to it.</p>
 <p>Even though the two girls were powerful, they still needed quite some time to be the most low ranked State Master. If they cultivated through normal methods, it would be even slower. If they had people helping them or medicinal pills to aid them, it would naturally be faster.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Qing Shui had a feeling that either their cultivation in Southern Sea must have been really special or they had some external aids. Or else, the two girls wouldn’t have been able to make such fast progress in their cultivation.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Is joining the Heaven Secret Academy not good?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“No, of course It’s good. Who would have thought that you’re this lucky. Eldest Princess has given you a place, hasn’t she?” Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui with a strange look.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Tantai Xuan. He kept doing it and waited until she withdrew her eyesight, then only he turned around. Previously when he saw Tantai Xuan’s shy expression, he felt really happy.</p>
 <p>He also didn’t know what he was happy about, it was as if his intuition told him that as long as he was able to make women bashfully withdraw their sight, he would feel happy.</p>
 <p>“Ruyan, how are you doing in Southern Sea?” Qing Shui looked at the current Yu Ruyan. It was obvious that she looked a lot happier compared to back when she was in the five continents.</p>
 <p>“I am doing great! It was just that sometimes, I miss you,” Yu Ruyan said softly.</p>
 <p>“Can you guys only start getting corny after I am gone?” Tantai Xuan asked.</p>
 <p>The things which she just said made the three of them feel awkward, “Miss Tantai… You saw all of me……”</p>
 <p>“Go to hell! Stop talking. Do you seriously think that I want to see it? It was so ugly.”</p>
 <p>“Which part of me looked ugly? You have seen it and yet you said that it looks ugly. Are you cold-blooded? I am the one who is at a disadvantage.” Qing Shui was particularly speechless.</p>
 <p>He was really speechless. After all, while he was making love to Yu Ruyan, those insastiable expression and, invasive movements of his has all been seen by her. Actually, men never liked a third person looking at them and their women having fun. Even if the spectator had been a beautiful woman, as long as the woman didn’t join in, they would feel repulsed by it.</p>
 <p>“Alright, stop talking.” Yu Ruyan added on in an embarrassing tone. Actually, she felt just as embarrassed. But since they were close like sisters, she decided to forget about it.</p>
 <p>Or else last time, she wouldn’t have visited Southern Sea again.</p>
 <p>“Ruyan, I miss you… I have a lot of things that I want to tell you about.” Qing Shui held Yu Ruyan’s hand.</p>
 <p>This made Yu Ruyan blush. Tantai Xuan on the other hand, scoffed and stood up, “Make it quick. At night, I am sleeping with Sister Ruyan.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, could it be that you like women?” Qing Shui looked at Tantai Xuan strangely. He was so shocked that he dropped his jaw.</p>
 <p>“You filthy man… What are you thinking? You are the one who likes women.” Tantai Xuan noticed that nothing good would happen whenever she met Qing Shui. But she felt very strange that she felt this way.</p>
 <p>In the past, she would never even dare to think. Maybe because he had done her a huge favor before in the Ancient Ruins or maybe because Qing Shui was the first man to hug her…...</p>
 <p>In any case, she felt conflicted. She had never had any thoughts about wanting to do anything with Qing Shui, so much so that she never even once thought about it with any other guys. Actually, she felt really conflicted, especially after the awkward incident which happened last time. The most important thing was that even this man had already found out about it. This made her felt conflicted for a very long period of time. Since that, she was never able to be at peace, like how she used to in the past.</p>
 <p>The impact of those pictures was too large. That was a feeling which she had never felt before.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan went out!</p>
 <p>As Yu Ruyan saw Tantai Xuan go out, she glared at Qing Shui. That sweet and charming face of hers made Qing Shui feel excited. It was true that she was totally different from before. At least now, she was a little woman in front of him. It was not that she had thrown away her usual mature, charming, lazy and strong-willed self from the past. But when in front of him, he was the only person who would get to see this side of her, as a little woman.</p>
