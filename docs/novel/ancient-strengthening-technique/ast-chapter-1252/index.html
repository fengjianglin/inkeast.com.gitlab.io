 <p><strong>AST 1252 - There's A Reward For Winning, Killing You Will Just Be Like Stepping On An Ant</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very bemused, because the lady in his arms was the Eldest Princess. Moreover, it was in such a situation and she was feeling so satisfied...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt this lady embracing him tightly and not letting him move. However, she continued to twitch rhythmically and he could only hug her until she was completely satisfied...</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui felt like he was on fire. However, what could he possibly do? This woman wasn't thinking of doing anything at all. However, he hadn't expected that it would end so quickly that he couldn't even fully enjoy the feeling of having their bodies rub each other. He had wanted to stay in this state for a longer period of time since it would be another kind of enjoyment by itself and more of a mental impact.</p>
 <p>After all, to come into contact with a lady, especially an unrivaled beauty like her, imparted feelings of lethal seduction and great enjoyment in looking at her expression.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt a pain in his shoulder and an aggrieved voice rang out, "You're a rascal!"</p>
 <p>With that, the Eldest Princess ran away and her beautiful silhouette disappeared very quickly. However, she had appeared to be a little anxious. Qing Shui saw that his lower part was still upright, but there was a small area of moisture. This was her...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the Eldest Princess must have gone to wash up and change her clothes. He didn't know why he had this urge but thinking about it made it feel as if he were in a dream. Helpless, he could only forcibly suppress the nefarious flames in his body.</p>
 <p>He could not get that woman's misted and distant eyes out of his mind. Her expression when she was having a spasm made him almost lose his cool and make him do her there and then. He knew that in this life, he would have to be entangled with this woman.</p>
 <p>He still couldn't resist beautiful women. He admits that he liked her, but yet, at the same time, felt that he didn't do the other women he had justice. Such contradictions made Qing Shui feel uncertain about whether to proceed or step back at times like these.</p>
 <p>All of them were so outstanding. Although they hadn't said anything, Qing Shui knew that no women would be willing to share a man with another. Although this world had polygamous system, Qing Shui had a very strong view of monogamy.</p>
 <p>In his previous life, he had dreamt of having multiple wives and concubines, but in that society, no one could openly get married to two women and give them both equal status. Therefore, he had always felt that he hadn't been fair to his women.</p>
 <p>However, now that things had already come to this, it was impossible for him to insist on having only one wife. This was their destiny. This was also why Qing Shui had kept on telling himself that he mustn't increase the number of women he had. He wanted to just pay the current debt and not add onto it.</p>
 <p>Men and women were like yin and yang in the world. Without either side, the conditions for continued existence would not be fulfilled. Yin and yang innately had an attraction to each other. People tended to say that humans were creatures of food and lust. This just showed how important lust was.</p>
 <p>The intersection and merging of yin and yang was a mysterious feeling. It would bring about a mysterious energy. That exchange of the two’s mental state and souls would make one feel as if he were in the heavens and forget about everything else.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Qing Shui felt that everything from earlier felt so unrealistic. If not for the lingering scent that had been left behind, as well as the physical evidence left on him, he would have thought it was just an illusion. After waiting for a while but not seeing the Eldest Princess come out, Qing Shui knew that she must have felt too embarrassed.</p>
 <p>However, even if she didn't come out, Qing Shui could go and look for her. Qing Shui now felt that this lady was very beautiful. He slowly headed for the room the Eldest Princess had run into.</p>
 <p>This was his home. She had an interspatial silk sachet and thus could wash up and change here. Moreover, the Eldest Princess had gone to Qing Shui's room before. When he saw that the door was tightly closed, he knocked softly.</p>
 <p>The door opened very quickly. The Eldest Princess had changed into a golden phoenix pleated dress set. It was very bright and charming, and complimented the pink blush on her cheeks and the faint mist in her usually clear eyes. She took a look at Qing Shui and then avoided his gaze.</p>
 <p>"Sister Su, are you alright..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his question really was something.</p>
 <p>As expected, the Eldest Princess twisted one of his ears, "You little rascal. What can possibly be wrong with me..."</p>
 <p>"If you're fine, that's great, that's great. I'll go cook some food for your supplement!"</p>
 <p>"You're not allowed to bring that up." When had the Eldest Princess been so embarrassed before?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged her and said softly next to her ears, chuckling, "Did it feel good earlier?"</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess shivered, "You're not allowed to act so frivolous to me. What happened earlier should just be considered a reward for you."</p>
 <p>"I like this reward. If I am to win, you must reward me." Qing Shui appeared insatiable.</p>
 <p>"If you are to win, I'll give you a reward. Fight well tomorrow. I'm heading off!"</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess left without any delay, disappearing from Qing Shui's room.</p>
 <p>After the Eldest Princess left, Qing Shui let out a long exhale. In the future, she would definitely become his. She would also become the head of the Heaven Secrets Academy and might even head out to the other three continents to vie for the top spot.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>At noon the next day, a huge crowd was gathered near the Heaven Secrets Arena and it was an extremely lively scene. No one had expected to be able to watch another battle at the Heaven Secrets Arena within such a short time. Therefore, they were all very excited.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui didn't come very late. On the contrary, he came 15 minutes early. He stayed with the people from the Breezing Wind Veranda. There were now fifty percent more people in the Breezing Wind Veranda compared to last time. Qing Shui told the Eldest Princess to recruit new people, and to set higher conditions for joining. Another goal was for her to build up the cohesion in the Breezing Wind Veranda and let them feel like a big family.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was the first to appear on the Heaven Secrets Arena. He then cupped his fists together toward the people below the arena.</p>
 <p>“Today, I am here because the Saint Child Band, the Lord Sect, and the Left Moon Hall have issued me a challenge. I won't say much. Each participant will be responsible for his own life and death today. The people who lose can choose to agree to the winner's condition in exchange for having their lives spared. Of course, it will be dependent on the winner to decide whether to accept it or not. If you can afford to lose, then you still have a chance for regrets. I don't like to be disturbed, but some people have been jumping around in front of me for quite a while." Qing Shui said directly, further pushing the limits with the other few groups.</p>
 <p>"Arrogant. The other time, it was only by luck that he managed to get a draw against the Saint Child. Does he really think he's that good?"</p>
 <p>"He's too arrogant. What right do you have to say that people are jumping around in front of you? You think too highly of yourself."</p>
 <p>"Later, he probably won't even know how he died."</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, we believe in you. Defeat them! They're just people who are undeserving of their reputations!"</p>
 <p>"That's right. They only know how to bully others on the account of their own reputation. Cripple them!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Fu Yantian once again landed on the Heaven Secrets Arena. His gaze as he looked at Qing Shui was still considered calm.</p>
 <p>"You must be careful today. This time around, I won't be holding back." Fu Yantian looked at Qing Shui and directly drew out that War Halberd.</p>
 <p>"If you lose, get your entire Saint Child Band to obey the Breezing Wind Veranda from now on." Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>Fu Yanting was stunned. The reason Qing Shui had said this was because everyone could hear what he said. The person who went back on his words must pay a price. Another reason was because Qing Shui felt that Fu Yantian was still considered a man of his word. If he could surrender and pay his allegiance, Qing Shui would naturally have his ways of subduing him. Moreover, Qing Shui also knew that an arrogant person like him would definitely not surrender.</p>
 <p>"What if you lose?"</p>
 <p>"If I lose, you can do whatever you want with me." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright. The people here will all be our witnesses. Let's start!" Fu Yantian took a step forward and said.</p>
 <p>"Make your move. Otherwise, you won't even have a chance to do so later." Qing Shui's words caused Fu Yantian's mouth to twitch uncontrollably. He seemed to have said this before in the previous battle.</p>
 <p>"You don't know what's good for you!"</p>
 <p>Fu Yantian unleashed all his prowess, activated the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, and unleashed an explosive bright glow. The War Halberd in his hand became increasingly translucent and glimmered in light, exuding a sharp killing intent.</p>
 <p>A single spear to break the soul, separating man from world!(Need reference from c1241)</p>
 <p>The Saint Child just used the powerful attack he had used previously.</p>
 <p>"I'm going to see how you're going to fend this off. How are you going to fight me if you're not bringing out your demonic beast?"</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui didn't call out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Therefore, Fu Yantian attempted to cripple Qing Shui in a single move.</p>
 <p>Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p>Eight-Eight Divine Nebula Formation！</p>
 <p>Seventh Wave of the Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Confinement!</p>
 <p>Seven huge golden palms formed the shape of a lotus, confining Fu Yantian and his War Halberd.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's current confinement abilities would not only be able to deal with Fu Yantian's abilities of 2,000 suns, but also be able to contain someone who had a strength of 4,000 suns. The Eight-Eight Divine Nebula Formation wasn't something that was just for viewing.</p>
 <p>"Killing you now will just be like stepping down on an ant!" Qing Shui looked at the confined Fu Yantian and said calmly.</p>
 <p>Fu Yantian was now stunned. To think that he was confined by the opponent's spirit energy. How could he continue the fight? For him to be confined by the opponent's spirit energy would require the opponent to have a spirit energy that was a lot stronger than his. Since Qing Shui could confine him, it would be easy for him to kill him as well.</p>
 <p>It had only been a few days. How could he have gotten so strong? Could it be that he hadn't gone all out the previous time...</p>
 <p>"Fu Yantian, make your choice. Do you want to continue the fight or submit to the Breezing Wind Veranda?"</p>
 <p>Silence fell, leaving only erratic breaths and astonished gasps.</p>
 <p>Fu Yantian was completely disheartened. To think he had lost in just a single move. What kind of genius was he calling himself? What genius blessed by the heavens... In that moment, he understood that he had been driven to a corner.</p>
 <p>"Pffft!"</p>
 <p>Spewing out a mouthful of blood, Fu Yantian quickly shriveled as his vitality and cultivation leaked. He was crippled. Even if he didn't die, he had already become a cripple.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't continue to bring up any other conditions. He let out a sigh as he watched other people help Fu Yantian off the arena. The Fu Clan hadn't managed to thrive under him, and in the future, it would only go into decline.</p>
 <p>"Tian Jianxian, come on up!" Qing Shui said in the Lord Sect's direction.</p>
 <p>A tall and valiant looking man appeared on the Heaven Secrets Arena. He didn't look that much alike Tian Jiange. He was rough but had a mystical aura. This gave off a very weird feeling. His abilities were on par with Fu Yantian.</p>
 <p>Fu Yantian had been defeated in a single move. He couldn't accept the two consecutive defeats. Having lived a smooth-sailing life for many years, suddenly losing to a person twice in a row was impossible for him to accept.</p>
 <p>However, Tian Jianxian was no better. He was also feeling disheartened. He numbly walked up to the Heaven Secrets Arena. Although he wasn't stronger than Fu Yantian, he had issued the challenge. Right now, he wanted to admit defeat, but admitting defeat was a humiliation to a cultivator. Furthermore, he was on the side of those who had issued a letter of challenge, together with the others. With what had become of Fu Yantian, he would be drowned in jeers if he were to admit defeat.</p>
 <p>"You're no longer suitable to lead the Lord Sect anymore. Support your younger brother to manage the Lord Sect. He's more suitable than you. In the future, he'll achieve greater things. I wonder if you’ll agree to my opinion?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
