 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady was silent, before looking at Qing Shui: “I’ll sever my meridians, could you help me reattach them?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sha’er, stop fooling around, how could you suspect Miraculous Physician Qing.” The old man shouted, but Qing Shui could still feel the joy and indulgence emanating from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are also afflicted with a hidden disease, I can help you for free later on if there’s such a need.” Finished speaking, Qing Shui turned to look at the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s words had another implicit meaning, that helping the old man would come at a price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Master still has time to turn back, as a doctor I will not assure you of anything, but I will put forth my best effort, do you still wish to take a chance?” Qing Shui wished to see the potential of the old man.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Compared to living like this, may as well take a shot, I have faith in Mister anyway.” The old man forthrightly said.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miraculous Physician Qing, I hope you truly can cure my daddy.” Ziche Sha looked at Qing Shui and spoke seriously, her tranquil tone carrying an unclear connotation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The filial piety of Miss Ziche can be seen by the heavens, the Old Master will certainly be blessed with safety.” Qing Shui said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, the lady’s hands began to tremble, this scoundrel actually dared to try his luck on this matter, but she was had no way of changing the situation, the matters that her father had decided on were final, this time father had brought them to his side, meant that as long as the physician was able to describe the symptoms, and say they could cure it, even a fraction of a success rate would be worth a shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire curing process blew the other people’s minds, Qing Shui directly used his golden needles to sever the old man’s meridians, making him bit his lip in pain, his face a sheet of pale white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Fei however, did not make any sounds, Qing Shui calmly drew out the invisible qi within his body, before reattaching his meridians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used the Qi of Rebirth to reattach the meridians, which actually required a long period of time, the old man’s children were all extremely anxious, as the old man was their pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui only stopped after four hours, though he could have been faster, and could have lessened the old man’s suffering, but sometimes the message needed to be sent across through pain</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is my Daddy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was in a weakened and semi-conscious state, Ziche Sha anxiously asked after seeing Qing Shui stop, while the others also shot worried glances towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It will have no damage to him, he will wake up after a while, take this and boil the medicine, let him drink it.” Qing Shui took out a bag of medicine and gave it to Ziche Sha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Sha quickly took the medicine to boil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This short time seemed extremely long, after a while, Ziche Fei slowly opened his eyes, on his tired face were streaks of unmistakable exuberance and joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you Miraculous Physician, I can feel my recover, this is truly unthinkable, you are the strongest Miraculous Physician I’ve seen.” The old man happily said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused the others to be jolted with shock, to actually reattach meridians, though they did not know their father’s condition, but they sought out many powerful physicians and Alchemists who were all helpless, yet this young man managed to accomplish it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This meant that, stronger than those other people, who were considered Miraculous Physicians in their own right, this young man had far surpassed them, and was a true Miraculous Physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miraculous Physician, a god-class physician!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Ziche Sha already had the medicine ready at the side, it only required water to run over it, so only a short while was needed, hearing Ziche Fei’s words, Ziche Sha’s eyes shone with an incredulous look, this was the first time she had seen a man differently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Try not to overuse your Origin Qi this month, after a month the recovery will be complete, I shall leave now.” Qing Shui smiled and said</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also reminded them, it was time to pay for the treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the fee for this treatment was not ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sha’er, you escort Mister, you can remunerate him on the way out.” Ziche Fei saw that this young Miraculous Physician had astonishing capabilities, he felt that they were rather harmonious together, if they could get together, this would be a good thing for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shocked, was this old man trying to give away her daughter, though she was pretty good, Qing Shui did not have such intentions…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Ziche Sha knew of his dirty and frivolous thinking, she might’ve fought him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui bid the others farewell before leaving, with Ziche Sha following him out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have cured my father, how do you wish to be remunerated.” Ziche Sha lightly said, she did not know how best to thank Qing Shui, a Miraculous Physician like Qing Shui would not care for ordinary things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where’s the Ziche Clan’s sincerity, unless you want me to give conditions? When I raise conditions, would you be unilaterally willing to comply?” Qing Shui turned around to tease her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not angry, he simply did not know what the Ziche Clan was cooking up, hearing her words made him feel like an extortionist, if it was truly like this, then he really wouldn’t mind extorting a little.</span></p>

With Daddy’s experience, he is no scoundrel, with his capabilities he does not need to stoop so low, while his eyes are limpid, you can go over to the Imperial Cuisine Hall to take a look, then you will discover what kind of person he is, a dispirited lady walked in bringing four children, he sought no remuneration and took them in, he can treat poor people for free, give away free medicine, while towards the rich, he would charge exorbitant prices, ten times, a hundred times of ordinary prices, he justifies it by saying that an able man should do more…...He has confidence, some martial artists or rich people, in order to treat their illnesses, he would ask for half their assets, would they prefer their wealth or their life?...... The harshest terms he gave was to choose between their life and all their assets, that is truly a question of money or life. Of course this is all targeted at the immoral evildoers, but even if they are good people, so long as they can afford it, they should expect to pay a bit more.”</span></p>
