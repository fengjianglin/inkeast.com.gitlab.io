 <p><strong>Chapter 271 Fisherman? He Is Immortal Sword Sect’s First Elder, Make A Decision!.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 271 Fisherman? He Is Immortal Sword Sect’s First Elder, Make A Decision!</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui made a pot of fish soup before he exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal since he noticed that the underground stream had passing fishes and prawns, and quite a number of them at that.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui brought out the fish soup as he walked out, surprising the two ladies. He simply avoided their gaze for fear that they might question him. After all, there were some things which could not be explained without telling the truth. However, thank goodness for him there were many strange things in the world of the nine continents.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was just that the things that had happened in recent times had diminished quite a lot of their curiosity, so much such that the explanation Qing Shui had prepared was not put to use.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After drinking the fish soup, they felt more energized. Qing Shui also drank a bowl of it since he could not possibly say that he had drank it earlier. Hearing that there was water, the two ladies said that they would like to wash up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You keep watch here. We won’t be wearing clothes, don’t peep!” Huoyun Liu-Li said, smiling a little shyly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue turned flush red and walked away with the smiling Huoyun Liu-LIi. Qing Shui was speechless. Was she trying to seduce him? Or was she trying to “take revenge” for what he had said earlier?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Demoness, this demoness. One day, I’ll teach her a lesson.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stood silently at the entrance of the cave. While he could not see anything, he could hear the sounds of them undressing, causing boiling images to appear in Qing Shui’s mind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was to the extent that Qing Shui even started to fantasize about that beauty portrait he had left in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was written on the painting that the ladies in the drawings all had divine bodies</span> <span style>and were great treasures.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui did not know how long ago this painting was done, nor did he knew which era the creator had belonged to. It was said that he had spent over 300 years to create all 12 beauty portraits. The paintings gave off a very strong but simplistic aura, and there was not a single speck of dust on the character in the painting. It was hard for Qing Shui to imagine how that one spot could remain clean without a speck of dust when all the other areas in the cave were covered in dust.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Was it because of that single piece of land or was it because of the painting? The underground stream passed by the area, and it was a piece of land with great fengshui. Moreover, when he was there earlier, Qing Shui had felt a hint of slight breeze blowing, making him feel really refreshed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Elder sister, your breasts look so beautiful. Do you think Qing Shui will pounce at you if he sees it?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s voice was not very soft, and Qing Shui heard it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“She is doing this one on purpose…” Qing Shui was speechless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Liu-Li, what are you saying?” Canghai Mingyue complained in an embarrassed voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, let’s tease that bad guy outside.” Huoyun Liu-Li’s voice was making Qing Shui crazy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ahhh, Liu-Li, you’re so bad. Stop touching…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, “...”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Miss, if you guys continue to seduce me, the two of you will be held responsible for extinguishing the flames you started. I wouldn’t mind having sex with the two of you in the water.” Qing Shui hollered viciously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With Qing Shui’s holler, the other side immediately turned quiet. Qing Shui suddenly felt relaxed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ahhh, elder sister, be softer, it’s turned red from your touch ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After a while, Huoyun Liu-Li’s voice which made Qing Shui tingled all over rang out once again. Qing Shui walked straight in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Seeing the scene before him, Qing Shui was completely speechless. The two ladies were both properly dressed, and Huoyun Liu-Li was holding onto a small turtle which he assumed was from the spring. Each time the turtle’s head stretch out, Canghai Mingyue would knock on it gently… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt as if he was starting to break out in sweat… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Upon seeing Qing Shui, the two ladies laughed softly, and craftily. However, Qing Shui was looking at that little turtle in a daze, and what appeared in his mind was the scene of not Canghai Mingyue knocking on the turtle’s head, but his… [1]</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyu looked at Qing Shui, puzzled. She did not know why Qing Shui was staring at her hand in a daze. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled awkwardly at her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mingyue, remember, in the future, don’t touch a turtle’s head in front of other men…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why? Is there a saying about it?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked, perturbed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, Qing Shui was certain that these two ladies had not seen that male body part before. After all, the turtle’s head looked so similar to that body part.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That big bird’s[3] head looks exactly the same as this turtle’s head, and even their names are the same…” Qing Shui grinned. He knew that women like Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li might not have came across such crude words.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li gave out a shocking cry. Qing Shui was stunned. It seemed as if she had realized what Qing Shui was saying and she looked at Canghai Mingyue, blushing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue had not even known of the term big bird earlier… and had gotten to know about it through Qing Shui. And from Qing Shui’s tone previously, it did not sound like something good, and that she was taken verbal advantage of. Now, she only felt that it was fun to see that turtle’s head shrinking in and stretching out, but to think that it was connected with the big bird… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue who had thought that Qing Shui was teasing her suddenly noticed Huoyun Liu-Li’s expression and she quickly hid her hand behind her back. Her anxious look was especially charming and moving!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li quickly tossed the turtle into the spring, mumbling, “You bad thing, you’re as bad as Qing Shui.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was speechless. Was that not saying that he was a turtle? Forget it, just take it that he had let them knocked on his turtle’s head… </span></p>
  <p><span style>After washing up, the two ladies looked totally refreshed. Huoyun Liu-Li took out a small square piece of purple silk and covered up her face, revealing only her soul-snatching eyes, looking at Qing Shui charmingly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mingyue, let’s head back to take a look.” Qing shui knew that Canghai Mingyue was hung up about her mother’s corpse. Moreover, the old blindee and Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor were already dead. Qing Shui did not think much of the remaining people. At the very least, he should have no problem escaping with this group.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue was stunned for a moment before she looked at Qing Shui and smiled, “Thank you, Qing Shui!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This time around, Qing Shui did not say anything. Although she had said thanks while smiling, it had made him feel uncomfortable. Qing Shui was a bit angry.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was already afternoon. Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li chatted about insignificant stuff, and Qing Shui did not like it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that if he was back in his previous life, women like Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li would definitely not cross paths with him. They would belong to totally different world. Even if he were to work hard all his life, he might not even be able to get to say a word to them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the world of the nine continents, one’s abilities speak for everything. Qing Shui had strangely got his hands on some stronger techniques equipping him with some powers. However, Qing Shui still subconsciously discriminated against such women, but yet at the same time, he had the urge to taint them as it would give him a strong sense of satisfaction. Therefore, each time Qing Shui had the chance, he would tease her just to deepen her impression of him, even if it was a negative one. It was good so long as she could remember him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although there were a few times Qing Shui had felt that Canghai Mingyue was slightly dependent on him, he knew that it was because her mental state was very fragile at those moments. But even so, Qing Shui had not felt that she had feelings of love towards him. The most it would be is that she had treated him like half a kin… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Towards Canghai Mingyue, Qing Shui would always feel that their distance was very far. Even when she was crying in his arms, there was a gap between their hearts. A disappointment of not being able to reach each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Very soon, they were above Canghai’s residence. Qing Shui looked down and saw nothing but silence below. With one glance, he saw that Canghai Mingyue’s mother’s corpse was still around, and there was still that eye-catching pit!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue hugged her mother’s corpse, and broke down in tears again. Consoled by both Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li, they buried her mother’s corpse where Canghai had died, in order to let the couple be “buried together”.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mingyue, don’t feel sad anymore. The two of them are in the heaven smiling at you.” Qing Shui gently patted the kneeling Canghai Mingyue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Canghai Mingyue cried even harder than before. Qing Shui smiled bitterly and gently patted her back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Come out. You’ve been observing for so long.” Qing Shui pulled up Canghai Mingyue and said nonchalantly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were shocked as they looked towards Qing Shui!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hahaha, Qing Shui, your spiritual sense is so strong, I was right about you.” A few figures walked out. Qing Shui fell into a stupor when he saw the leader. So were the two ladies.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was Qinghan Ye’s grandfather, that unfathomable old man. The four men behind him were all white-haired old man, each of them wearing a set of snow white colored clothes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Members of Immortal Sword Sect!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Old sir, this is?” Qing Shui could not hold in his astonishment and asked. After all, he was sure that the people behind him were all from Immortal Sword Sect, but they all seemed to be full of respect for Qinghan Ye’s grandfather.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Grand Elder, that lady is Canghai couple’s daughter, we must eliminate the source at the roots. We cannot leave this chap either.” A burly white haired old man said, without a care. It was obvious that that he did not think highly of Qing Shui and the others.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt extremely overwhelmed. He was the Immortal Sword Sect’s Grand Elder? Now that the old blindee and Ancestor were both dead, the one in the Elder’s Council with the greatest authority was the Grand Elder.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui would never have expected that this old man with unfathomable powers would be the Immortal Sword Sect’s Grand Elder.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at Qinghan Ye’s grandfather. This old man was definitely stronger than the Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor, weaker than Canghai, and weaker than the old blindee before he broke through. However, he was not someone Qing Shui could handle.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt very bitter. He recalled their first encounter when he was astonished that such an expert had opened a medicinal store, and he was touched by his love for his granddaughter.</span></p>
  <p><span style>What was the situation now though? In a situation where the crane and the clam fought, the fisherman was the eventual winner, and the old man was the fisherman? [2]</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui, dejectedly. She lifted her head and spoke, “I’m from Canghai Clan, and I am the Canghai Clan’s last member. They have nothing to do with my Canghai Clan. If you guys agree to let them off, I’ll slit my own throat before you.” Canghai Mingyue knew that Qing Shui’s wounds were very serious and it was hard for them to escape. She was the one who had wanted to return, and had implicated Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li. But it was too late to say anything now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled bitterly and pulled Canghai Mingyue back, “I’m not dead yet, why are you stepping forth?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue allowed Qing Shui to pull her. Hearing Qing Shui’s “I’m not dead yet, why are you stepping forth?”, tears dropped down as she said, “Qing Shui, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui gently wiped off her tears. Her skin was so translucent and thin that it was as if it would break upon a slight touch. His fingers trembled a bit when they came into contact with her skin. He then decided to just wipe off the tears with the back of his hand. But the more he wiped away, the more tears flowed out. He hugged her tightly!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, we are considered acquaintances and Ye Er is greatly indebted to you. What do you think about this? Are you interested ingin follow me back to Immortal Sword Sect? I’ll give you Ye Er’s hand in marriage. I know you have you have a unique constitution. So long as the two of you get married and complete intercourse, I’ll let you become my Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor.” Immortal Sword Sect’s Grand Elder said calmly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was impossible for Qing Shui to not feel tempted in that moment. Not only would he get himself a beauty, if he were to start off in the Immortal Sword Sect, he would be able to save himself at least 20 years of effort.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This sounds like such a good deal.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Grand Elder…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Grand Elder…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Grand Elder waved his hand and interrupted the others. He looked at Qing Shui and said, “There’s one more condition.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh? Please do say!” Qing Shui grinned and said, feeling lighthearted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue had long let go of Qing Shui and was staring at him in a slight daze.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Kill the two ladies next to you!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was not surprised at this request, and had even been expecting it. After hearing it, he chuckled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are you laughing at?” The Grand Elder smiled and asked calmly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>[1] In chinese, the turtle’s head can also be referring to the glans, or the head of the p*nis.</span></p>

However, thank goodness for him there were many strange things in the world of the nine continents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that the things that had happened in recent times had diminished quite a lot of their curiosity, so much such that the explanation Qing Shui had prepared was not put to use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After drinking the fish soup, they felt more energized. Qing Shui also drank a bowl of it since he could not possibly say that he had drank it earlier. Hearing that there was water, the two ladies said that they would like to wash up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You keep watch here. We won’t be wearing clothes, don’t peep!” Huoyun Liu-Li said, smiling a little shyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue turned flush red and walked away with the smiling Huoyun Liu-LIi. Qing Shui was speechless. Was she trying to seduce him? Or was she trying to “take revenge” for what he had said earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demoness, this demoness. One day, I’ll teach her a lesson.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui stood silently at the entrance of the cave. While he could not see anything, he could hear the sounds of them undressing, causing boiling images to appear in Qing Shui’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was to the extent that Qing Shui even started to fantasize about that beauty portrait he had left in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was written on the painting that the ladies in the drawings all had divine bodies</span> <span style>and were great treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui did not know how long ago this painting was done, nor did he knew which era the creator had belonged to. It was said that he had spent over 300 years to create all 12 beauty portraits. The paintings gave off a very strong but simplistic aura, and there was not a single speck of dust on the character in the painting. It was hard for Qing Shui to imagine how that one spot could remain clean without a speck of dust when all the other areas in the cave were covered in dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it because of that single piece of land or was it because of the painting? The underground stream passed by the area, and it was a piece of land with great fengshui. Moreover, when he was there earlier, Qing Shui had felt a hint of slight breeze blowing, making him feel really refreshed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder sister, your breasts look so beautiful. Do you think Qing Shui will pounce at you if he sees it?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s voice was not very soft, and Qing Shui heard it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is doing this one on purpose…” Qing Shui was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu-Li, what are you saying?” Canghai Mingyue complained in an embarrassed voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, let’s tease that bad guy outside.” Huoyun Liu-Li’s voice was making Qing Shui crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh, Liu-Li, you’re so bad. Stop touching…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui, “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, if you guys continue to seduce me, the two of you will be held responsible for extinguishing the flames you started. I wouldn’t mind having sex with the two of you in the water.” Qing Shui hollered viciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Qing Shui’s holler, the other side immediately turned quiet. Qing Shui suddenly felt relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh, elder sister, be softer, it’s turned red from your touch ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Huoyun Liu-Li’s voice which made Qing Shui tingled all over rang out once again. Qing Shui walked straight in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the scene before him, Qing Shui was completely speechless. The two ladies were both properly dressed, and Huoyun Liu-Li was holding onto a small turtle which he assumed was from the spring. Each time the turtle’s head stretch out, Canghai Mingyue would knock on it gently… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui felt as if he was starting to break out in sweat… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing Qing Shui, the two ladies laughed softly, and craftily. However, Qing Shui was looking at that little turtle in a daze, and what appeared in his mind was the scene of not Canghai Mingyue knocking on the turtle’s head, but his… [1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyu looked at Qing Shui, puzzled. She did not know why Qing Shui was staring at her hand in a daze. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled awkwardly at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mingyue, remember, in the future, don’t touch a turtle’s head in front of other men…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? Is there a saying about it?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked, perturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Qing Shui was certain that these two ladies had not seen that male body part before. After all, the turtle’s head looked so similar to that body part.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That big bird’s[3] head looks exactly the same as this turtle’s head, and even their names are the same…” Qing Shui grinned. He knew that women like Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li might not have came across such crude words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li gave out a shocking cry. Qing Shui was stunned. It seemed as if she had realized what Qing Shui was saying and she looked at Canghai Mingyue, blushing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue had not even known of the term big bird earlier… and had gotten to know about it through Qing Shui. And from Qing Shui’s tone previously, it did not sound like something good, and that she was taken verbal advantage of. Now, she only felt that it was fun to see that turtle’s head shrinking in and stretching out, but to think that it was connected with the big bird… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue who had thought that Qing Shui was teasing her suddenly noticed Huoyun Liu-Li’s expression and she quickly hid her hand behind her back. Her anxious look was especially charming and moving!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li quickly tossed the turtle into the spring, mumbling, “You bad thing, you’re as bad as Qing Shui.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was speechless. Was that not saying that he was a turtle? Forget it, just take it that he had let them knocked on his turtle’s head… </span></p>
 <p><span style>After washing up, the two ladies looked totally refreshed. Huoyun Liu-Li took out a small square piece of purple silk and covered up her face, revealing only her soul-snatching eyes, looking at Qing Shui charmingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mingyue, let’s head back to take a look.” Qing shui knew that Canghai Mingyue was hung up about her mother’s corpse. Moreover, the old blindee and Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor were already dead. Qing Shui did not think much of the remaining people. At the very least, he should have no problem escaping with this group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue was stunned for a moment before she looked at Qing Shui and smiled, “Thank you, Qing Shui!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time around, Qing Shui did not say anything. Although she had said thanks while smiling, it had made him feel uncomfortable. Qing Shui was a bit angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already afternoon. Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li chatted about insignificant stuff, and Qing Shui did not like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that if he was back in his previous life, women like Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li would definitely not cross paths with him. They would belong to totally different world. Even if he were to work hard all his life, he might not even be able to get to say a word to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the world of the nine continents, one’s abilities speak for everything. Qing Shui had strangely got his hands on some stronger techniques equipping him with some powers. However, Qing Shui still subconsciously discriminated against such women, but yet at the same time, he had the urge to taint them as it would give him a strong sense of satisfaction. Therefore, each time Qing Shui had the chance, he would tease her just to deepen her impression of him, even if it was a negative one. It was good so long as she could remember him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although there were a few times Qing Shui had felt that Canghai Mingyue was slightly dependent on him, he knew that it was because her mental state was very fragile at those moments. But even so, Qing Shui had not felt that she had feelings of love towards him. The most it would be is that she had treated him like half a kin… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Towards Canghai Mingyue, Qing Shui would always feel that their distance was very far. Even when she was crying in his arms, there was a gap between their hearts. A disappointment of not being able to reach each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, they were above Canghai’s residence. Qing Shui looked down and saw nothing but silence below. With one glance, he saw that Canghai Mingyue’s mother’s corpse was still around, and there was still that eye-catching pit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue hugged her mother’s corpse, and broke down in tears again. Consoled by both Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li, they buried her mother’s corpse where Canghai had died, in order to let the couple be “buried together”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mingyue, don’t feel sad anymore. The two of them are in the heaven smiling at you.” Qing Shui gently patted the kneeling Canghai Mingyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Canghai Mingyue cried even harder than before. Qing Shui smiled bitterly and gently patted her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come out. You’ve been observing for so long.” Qing Shui pulled up Canghai Mingyue and said nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were shocked as they looked towards Qing Shui!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, Qing Shui, your spiritual sense is so strong, I was right about you.” A few figures walked out. Qing Shui fell into a stupor when he saw the leader. So were the two ladies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Qinghan Ye’s grandfather, that unfathomable old man. The four men behind him were all white-haired old man, each of them wearing a set of snow white colored clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Members of Immortal Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old sir, this is?” Qing Shui could not hold in his astonishment and asked. After all, he was sure that the people behind him were all from Immortal Sword Sect, but they all seemed to be full of respect for Qinghan Ye’s grandfather.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Elder, that lady is Canghai couple’s daughter, we must eliminate the source at the roots. We cannot leave this chap either.” A burly white haired old man said, without a care. It was obvious that that he did not think highly of Qing Shui and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui felt extremely overwhelmed. He was the Immortal Sword Sect’s Grand Elder? Now that the old blindee and Ancestor were both dead, the one in the Elder’s Council with the greatest authority was the Grand Elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui would never have expected that this old man with unfathomable powers would be the Immortal Sword Sect’s Grand Elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at Qinghan Ye’s grandfather. This old man was definitely stronger than the Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor, weaker than Canghai, and weaker than the old blindee before he broke through. However, he was not someone Qing Shui could handle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui felt very bitter. He recalled their first encounter when he was astonished that such an expert had opened a medicinal store, and he was touched by his love for his granddaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the situation now though? In a situation where the crane and the clam fought, the fisherman was the eventual winner, and the old man was the fisherman? [2]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui, dejectedly. She lifted her head and spoke, “I’m from Canghai Clan, and I am the Canghai Clan’s last member. They have nothing to do with my Canghai Clan. If you guys agree to let them off, I’ll slit my own throat before you.” Canghai Mingyue knew that Qing Shui’s wounds were very serious and it was hard for them to escape. She was the one who had wanted to return, and had implicated Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li. But it was too late to say anything now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled bitterly and pulled Canghai Mingyue back, “I’m not dead yet, why are you stepping forth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue allowed Qing Shui to pull her. Hearing Qing Shui’s “I’m not dead yet, why are you stepping forth?”, tears dropped down as she said, “Qing Shui, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui gently wiped off her tears. Her skin was so translucent and thin that it was as if it would break upon a slight touch. His fingers trembled a bit when they came into contact with her skin. He then decided to just wipe off the tears with the back of his hand. But the more he wiped away, the more tears flowed out. He hugged her tightly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, we are considered acquaintances and Ye Er is greatly indebted to you. What do you think about this? Are you interested ingin follow me back to Immortal Sword Sect? I’ll give you Ye Er’s hand in marriage. I know you have you have a unique constitution. So long as the two of you get married and complete intercourse, I’ll let you become my Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor.” Immortal Sword Sect’s Grand Elder said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible for Qing Shui to not feel tempted in that moment. Not only would he get himself a beauty, if he were to start off in the Immortal Sword Sect, he would be able to save himself at least 20 years of effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sounds like such a good deal.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Elder…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Elder…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Elder waved his hand and interrupted the others. He looked at Qing Shui and said, “There’s one more condition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Please do say!” Qing Shui grinned and said, feeling lighthearted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue had long let go of Qing Shui and was staring at him in a slight daze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill the two ladies next to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was not surprised at this request, and had even been expecting it. After hearing it, he chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you laughing at?” The Grand Elder smiled and asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[1] In chinese, the turtle’s head can also be referring to the glans, or the head of the p*nis.</span></p>
