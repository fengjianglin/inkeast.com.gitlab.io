 <p><strong>AST 1269 - Would It Be Possible To Unite the Western Oxhe Continent? </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was taken aback. He hadn't expected that he really made the right guess, that the sect lord was actually a woman who had been hurt by a man before. She even went on to push the blame of the hurt she felt onto men and made it a tradition for the Lotus Sect.</p>
 <p>He was only unsure if she had joined the Lotus Sect before or after she had been hurt. Qing Shui smiled and looked at the two old men. "How strong is the Lotus Sect's sect lord?"</p>
 <p>Since the two old men said that it was likely that the sect lord would fight it out with him, he hoped to at least have an estimate of her abilities. This way, he wouldn't be caught in surprise when the time comes.</p>
 <p>"She isn't the strongest in the Lotus Sect, but is one of the few strongest with a strength of about 6,000 suns or slightly more." The golden dragon robed old man looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Oh? If it's just this bit, then things will be simple." Qing Shui replied with a smile.</p>
 <p>The two old men were in fact very astonished. Qing Shui's strength was unfathomable, but they knew that he wasn't boasting. For him to be able to apply Spiritual Confinement on a cultivator with a strength of 2,000 suns. This was sufficient to speak stories.</p>
 <p>"The Lotus Sect still has a Saint Lotus Elder Court with one or two old monsters whose strength should be at about 7,000 to 8,000 suns. They would generally not appear unless the Lotus Sect is facing a threat of life and death." The old man reminded.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't find it strange that the old men knew about these. His guess was that the Lotus Sect knew about the situation in the Heaven Secrets Academy as well.</p>
 <p>"Thank you Sirs for telling me these."</p>
 <p>The old man waved his hand. "There's no need to stand on ceremony with us. We're one family. We know that in the future, your achievements will go far beyond the Heaven Secrets Academy but we still hope that you can bring the Heaven Secrets Academy to greater heights."</p>
 <p>"Sir, be assured. If it's really as you said, I can guarantee that the Heaven Secrets Academy's reputation would be spread very far, even to the extent that all nine continents would know the existence of the Heaven Secrets Academy." Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>"Alright, Sunu's aptitude is in no way weaker than Fu Yantian and the others. We won't say much either. If Sunu is able to take on the huge responsibility, the two of us are willing to back off to join the Supreme Elder Group." The golden dragon robed old man smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"There's no hurry. No matter whether Sunu will be taking over the Heaven Secrets Academy, I'll still do my best."</p>
 <p>The two old men were both people with great experience and knew what they should be doing. The Heaven Secrets Academy would only be brought to greater heights if it was in the hands of Yu Sunu. It was because if their judgments weren't wrong, Qing Shui and Yu Sunu would definitely become husband and wife in the future.</p>
 <p>"Sir, I wonder if it would work to unite the entire Western Oxhe Continent?" Qing Shui had been conflicted on this problem. Was it necessary for him to take such actions?</p>
 <p>"It's possible, of course it is. If you wish to make a stand in the other three continents and go up against those people, it's absolutely necessary to unite the Western Oxhe Continent. It's even a crucial point." The golden dragon robed old man thought about it for very long before he said.</p>
 <p>After he heard what the old man had to say, Qing Shui fell silent, his thoughts whizzed through his head very fast. If he wished to unite the entire Western Oxhe Continent, he must first unite this half of the Western Oxhe Continent, including the Heaven Secrets Academy, Southern Sea Putuo Mountain, Lotus Sect, Divine Might Dynasty, and the other Grade Four Dynasty.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Secrets Academy was simple and could be achieved very quickly. But what about the Southern Sea Putuo Mountain? Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan were both there and Tantai Xuan was even the Chief Senior Disciple. What if she was the one to inherit the Putuo Mountain?</p>
 <p>The Lotus Sect didn't seem to be easy to deal with as well. Should he leave Di Chen there? Or should he give a push for Diwu Zhisha? And what about the Divine Might Dynasty? It seemed that he only knew Fu Rong?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it and felt that uniting the Western Oxhe Continent wasn't as easy as he had thought to be. After all, his strength was still not absolute and even if he was strong enough, what would he do about the Southern Sea Putuo Mountain? Tantai Xuan would probably not agree to his idea.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it for very long and decided to just go on with it and tackle the problems as they come. Things will eventually sort themselves out and there wasn't a need for him to think too much. With that, Qing Shui calmed down as well.</p>
 <p>Right now, the most important thing was the influences in the Heaven Secrets Academy. He must first twist everything here into a single rope and these two old men would definitely help him out.</p>
 <p>Neither the old man in the golden dragon robe or the one in the violet lion robe interrupted Qing Shui. They merely looked at him silently. With their years of experience, they could have a rough guess of what he was thinking.</p>
 <p>After a while, Qing Shui lifted his head and looked at the two old men. It was only a short while ago did he realize that the two old men actually didn’t have that much lifespan left. Otherwise, they wouldn't be looking for someone to takeover the Heaven Secrets Academy so early.</p>
 <p>The two old men had yet to reach the limits of their lifespans. For cultivators, it wasn't a case that they could live for as long as they had lifespan. For example, a Xiantian was said to have a lifespan of 500 years, but most people wouldn't get to live to this age.</p>
 <p>Many cultivators would have hidden injuries which they got during the process of their cultivation. Some of these injuries could not be cured completely, and thus many cultivators would not even reach half of their lifespans. This was something very normal.</p>
 <p>It was just how it was for these two old men. They had yet to life through half of their lifespans, but it was a pity that there were impurities and hidden injuries in their bodies which had accumulated over many years. These things would explode when they reach a certain phase.</p>
 <p>Once it were to explode, there was no way to help them. Of course, if they were to encounter some powerful heavenly and earthly treasures that could clean their bodies' impurities, when put to good use, those things could allow their lifespan to be slowly extended.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that in the future, he would still require these two old men's help. The Eldest Princess would also need some time before she could stand up to reign. Therefore, he could only help the two old men to increase their lifespan.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, this tea is good. To think that drinking tea can allow one's lifespan to be increased." The old man in golden dragon robe said in surprised as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"It's actually not hard to increase one's lifespan. The reason I've come today is actually so that I can help both Sirs to increase your lifespans." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made it sound so easy. In the world of the nine continents, when one was at the old men's level and for cultivators who were at Martial Saint level or higher, it was far too difficult for them to increase their lifespans. It was even priceless. After all, by allowing their clan's Old Ancestor to live longer, it would give the clan more time and assurance while they continued to nurture their next generation...</p>
 <p>"To increase our lifespans?"</p>
 <p>"If I'm not wrong, the two of you don't seem to have much lifespan left. This must also be why the two of you are so anxious to look for someone to take over the Heaven Secrets Academy." Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>"Sigh, before you appeared, we have to put in great investments in nurturing Fu Yantian. We hoped to be able to live for a few more years, but it's a bit hard to nurture Fu Yantian. In fact, even if it was you, we also feel that we don't have enough time. Although the Heaven Secrets Academy appears glorious, it's plagued internally." Right now, the old men seemed to said these in a very relaxed state.</p>
 <p>"Why not pass it to one who are one to two generations before Fu Yantian?" Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"It's the issue with their talents. A talented young man like yourself is a rare find, and even if there is one, it's hard to know where that person is. Although the disciples of the previous few generations before Fu Yantian are not bad, they are incomparable to the few from Fu Yantian's generation." The old man said helplessly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it and agreed. After all, there really weren't many who were of Fu Yantian's caliber. Even Tian Jianxian and the others would be slightly inferior to him. This was also why the Saint Child Band had become so influential.</p>
 <p>"The topic's been brought off. I don't dare to assure much, but it shouldn't be a problem for me to increase the lifespans of you two by around 100 years."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's words caused the two of them to be stunned. 100 years. What confidence! It wasn't a case where the longer one's lifespan was, the easier it was to increase. It was like trying to snatch more life from the heavens. Even three to five years were very difficult. As for 100 years, how could it be possible?</p>
 <p>After saying that, Qing Shui took out two porcelain bottles and handed them to the two old men. He also took out some Plum Blossom Wine.</p>
 <p>When the two old men saw the Spring of Life, their countenance changed and they looked toward Qing Shui in disbelief. However, they didn't ask. "I've come across some Spring of Life by accident. There isn't much, so I can't bring out more for the two of you." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"It's impossible for there to be a lot of such things. We're already very satisfied to be able to have a single drop. Qing Shui, thank you."</p>
 <p>It was impossible for the two old men to not get touched. They knew about the Spring of Life and even if it was discovered, it wouldn't be in a huge amount. It came in one drop each year, and any demonic beasts or wild beasts would be able to take it, even birds and worms. Moreover, the Spring of Life would exude a powerful Spiritual Qi and thus there were usually wouldn't even be a single drop left.</p>
 <p>This was why the Spring of Life was so precious. It could only be found in a place that had a sufficient level of Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>Without Qing Shui's consent, the demonic beasts in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal wouldn't dare to take the Spring of Life that was there by themselves.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, this thing is very precious. If used on us old men, it'll only be able to add a little lifespan. It's a bit of a waste." The old man in golden dragon robe looked at Qing Shui with hesitation.</p>
 <p>"Although I don't have much of it, I have several tens of drops. There's enough for each of you to have one." Qing Shui smiled in reply.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui said this, the two old men no longer insisted but smiled and took it. They didn't wonder if what Qing Shui said was the truth. No matter how much he had, him giving it to them was a display of his sincerity. Moreover, this young man wasn't here to ask anything of them.</p>
 <p>"Come, try this wine that I've brewed myself. It's unique and you won't find this anywhere else." Qing Shui opened up a vat of Plum Blossom Wine.</p>
 <p>The Plum Blossom Wine couldn't directly increase one's lifespan, but could add lifespan to the two old men when they drink it since it could cleanse some of the impurities in their bodies. Qing Shui had said that he was going to increase their lifespans by at least 100 years. That was actually a conservative estimation. If the effects were ideal, it could increase more.</p>
 <p>"This is so fragrant. This wine seems to be several thousands of years old. It's a good fight against Saint Grade wine..." The old men looked at the translucent liquid in surprise. It was like a heavenly nectar, its fragrance was thick yet light. Just smelling it would make one feel as if their internal organs experienced a cooling feeling.</p>
 <p>Astonishment!</p>
 <p>This vat of wine could be said to be a priceless treasure.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pour a cup for each of them. "Come, give it a try. This can increase a little of your lifespans as well."</p>
 <p>The two old men now found that the young man before them was increasingly unfamiliar to them. It was because Qing Shui said that he was the only one with this. Since he dared to say something like this, it could only mean one thing. This wine was brewed by himself or was passed down by his ancestors. He had said that this was a unique recipe to him. Judging from the age of the wine, it was impossible for him to be the one to have brewed it. However, the old men had a strange feeling that it was actually brewed by him…</p>
