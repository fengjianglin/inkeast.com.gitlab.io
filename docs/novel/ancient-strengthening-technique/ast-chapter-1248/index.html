 <p><strong>AST 1248 - Nine Yang Gold Needle Strengthen The Body. Qing Shui ingesting the Yang Pills.</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words surprised Eldest Princess. She only spoke slowly after looking at Qing Shui for quite a while: “I don’t know about love.”</p>
 <p>For someone who didn’t know about love. Would they find themselves able to believe in something of which they had not the slightest clue of what it was?</p>
 <p>Actually, no one would actually dare to admit that they know about love. However, a lot of those who didn’t have the slightest clue on what love was, believed in it. Or maybe, they were constantly trying to believe in love.</p>
 <p>“I also don’t know. But I believe in love.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“What is love?” Eldest Princess smiled when she finished speaking. She seemed to have talked about it before in the past. However, she still felt a bit lost on the subject.</p>
 <p>“The person who you look forward to seeing in your heart. Whenever you run into surprises, she will be the first person whom you think about and want to share with. You will hope for that person to be happy… You will hope that the person will only think of you…” Qing Shui smiled gently as he explained.</p>
 <p>He didn’t really know love. Hence, he only talked about the common emotions and feelings that one would feel in love. Or maybe, he only talked about how he felt when in love. He only wanted to help open up some of the windows in her heart and let her feel a new and unique side of the world.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess remained silent while listening to Qing Shui explain all about this. Only after this did she smile and reply: “Thank you. I seem to not have any of the features which you talked about in my heart. It’s as though I used to have these kinds of thoughts a long time ago. However, I didn’t really know when I started to lose all of these emotions.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also never expected things to turn out like this. After all, he had a lot of people which he missed in his heart. He was totally unable to understand how she felt. In the past, when he used to feel lonely, he still had his mother with him. At least there was still a shelter in his heart. However, since born, Eldest Princess was already the backbone of the royal family. Hence, she didn’t have any shelter. Her master was most likely not considered one for now, or else, she wouldn’t have this kind of extreme mindset.</p>
 <p>“Actually, you can try to change. For example, try to believe in a person and share with him about your happiness as well as your worries," Qing Shui said while smiling after thinking for a while. He was really serious about what he was saying now.</p>
 <p>“I’m already trying really hard to do so. I am trying to have faith in others and have the kind of feelings which you mentioned just now.” When Eldest Princess finished speaking, she glanced towards the two hands which Qing Shui was using to embrace her waist before looking towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I see. I am actually so lucky,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Don’t start coming up with crooked thoughts. You’ll see what happens if you do,” Eldest Princess blushed. She looked unusually good like that. There was a trace of an alluring playful look which belonged to that of a woman added on to her expression.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, you are a goddess among humans. I am also a very pure person. Even at this time when I’m hugging you, I wouldn’t harbor any lustful thoughts.” Qing Shui immediately declared his position.</p>
 <p>“Are you trying to say that I’m not attractive?” Eldest Princess asked angrily.</p>
 <p>“No, how’s that possible. Even if I were to harbor that kind of thought, I wouldn’t express it. Actually, I am already starting to feel restless. However, this heroic heart of mine is trying to stop me. My heart is struggling in a battle between men and heavens. Shall I eat you up?” Qing Shui smiled and said. Actually, he was also able to tell that Eldest Princess was joking.</p>
 <p>“Alright, here we go again. Why don’t we start now? Didn’t you say that you want me to calm down? I’m already really calm now.” Eldest Princess said while looking at the little man who seemed really matured despite his young age. There was a kind of warmth in her eyes.</p>
 <p>That warmth in her eyes stunned Qing Shui. Without himself noticing, he had already begun to hug her even tighter. He seemed to want to feel that warmth. However, he didn’t actually do anything too excessive.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, lay down on your belly.” Qing Shui pointed towards the bed in his room.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess couldn’t help but blush. This time, it looked really obvious. It’s just as she said, she was already trying her best to believe in Qing Shui… Laying down on the bed in front of a man…</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess took off her boots. The snow white long socks were unable to cover the outlines of her beautiful feet. They looked dainty and delicate, tempting people to go ahead and play with it. Or maybe even kiss it. This wasn’t actually because of problems related to foot fetishism, that was just a kind of temptation which was extremely delicate.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess laid down on the bed with her eyes slightly closed. Her extremely beautiful and graceful body was just being displayed right in front of Qing Shui. Her tied-up hair, as well as her long neck and perfect back which extended all the way to her butt… Together, they formed a fatally tempting butt curve.</p>
 <p>Even though she had her clothes on, it was just an unlined garment. Qing Shui stood beside the bed and calmed down his mind. He took out a box of golden needles and put them at the edge of the bed. After that, he started slowly rubbing both of his palms to make his hands hot.</p>
 <p>As he rubbed his palms, one of his palms started to look sparkling and translucent just like a jade. It seemed as though it was invisible. His other palm, on the other hand, shone with traces of faint golden light.</p>
 <p>Maybe because the noises when Qing Shui rubbed his palms made Eldest Princess panic, she couldn’t help but tremble. She opened a bit of her eyes and saw both of Qing Shui’s palms. She only managed to calm down after doing so.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Even if I were to take advantage of you, I would do it honorably. I would never do it sneakily,” Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>“You only know how to talk nonsense.” Eldest Princess could already be considered to be immune to Qing Shui. She didn’t seem to be against the way they talked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dropped down both of his hands on Eldest Princess’s pink back. It felt mild like jade. Even when there was a single garment in between, Qing Shui could still feel the extraordinarily good hand sensations. Even though Qing Shui wasn’t a virgin, and he also has had a few extreme beauties whom he had laid his fingers on before, it didn’t stop him from having his heart beating like a frisky monkey and his mind running wild like a cantering horse.</p>
 <p>He mentioned before that he wouldn’t take advantage of her sneakily. Hence, he hurriedly operated the Nine Yang Hand Techniques which he was familiar with as well as the Soft-Tendon Hand Technique. He used one of his hands to help her relax and numb her bones whereas he used the other one to help change everything within her body with his Nine Yang Force. He intended to upgrade her body function and help her make changes to her hidden potential.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui’s hands interacted with Eldest Princess, he could already feel the Eldest Princess trembling. But very quickly, she regained her composure. Following that, her body started getting even softer. Similar things were also happening to her bones. Furthermore, Qing Shui could also see Eldest Princess clenching her teeth tightly. She was trying hard to not make any noises.</p>
 <p>“You would feel more comfortable screaming it out.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui’s words came out, Eldest Princess let out a long and gentle moan. It sounded really beautiful and sweet.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess, on the other hand, she immediately covered her face with both of her hands.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was trying really hard to calm down his mind. This was because he was already starting to have erectile reactions towards it. He sped up the movements of his hands. Rubbing, tapping, grabbing as well as acupressure.</p>
 <p>After roughly thirty minutes, Qing Shui only took out the Golden Needle and started performing his Acupuncture Technique.</p>
 <p>However, the first thing he used was the Gold Needle Constitution Nurturing. After that, he used the Five Elements Acupuncture Power-up before finally settling down on the Extreme Yang Acupuncture. This kind of Nine Yang Acupuncture strengthening method was the toughest. Furthermore, his Needle Force would also get to be increased slowly until when her body reached its limit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made Eldest Princess extend out one of her hands because four of her fingers had already started showing black colors. They looked incomparably terrifying. Qing Shui used an object to grab them before piercing through her fingertips with the needles.</p>
 <p>The black blood dripped down drop by drop.</p>
 <p>The stinky smell of the black blood was very strong. This caused Eldest Princess to feel really embarrassed. However, Qing Shui smiled and said: “The toxic within your body is already considered to be quite little. This is one of the impurities hidden deep within one’s body. A lot of people would have it throughout half of their body. Once these get removed, the hidden potential within your body will be unlocked. By then, you will be able to increase your strength really fast.”</p>
 <p>After almost an hour, Qing Shui stopped and kept back his needles. Eldest Princess immediately ran back into the bathroom. Her body was already completely stained with sweat. That graceful body of hers could tempt someone to carry out criminal acts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui conveniently removed all the dirty blood and sprinkled the room with a bit of plum blossom from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to freshen up the air once again.</p>
 <p>By the time Eldest Princess came out, about one hour had passed. Eldest Princess who changed into a new cloth had her hair untied, making herself out to seem a bit lazy. Her entire momentum felt really different. The otherworldly aura emitted from her body has gotten a lot stronger. It was comparable to that of Yiye Jiange’s.</p>
 <p>What’s good was that her elegance has also gotten even stronger. As Qing Shui saw all of these, he already knew deep down that the result was quite decent. Her attitude had changed slightly.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess saw the paleness on Qing Shui’s pale face. His room was no longer stained with dirty blood. Furthermore, it also smelled unusually nice.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>“It’s quite effective. You look more beautiful and stronger now.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“I feel like I’m becoming more and more indebted to you.” Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that sooner or later, she was bound to say this. But this seemed a bit too fast for her to say it.</p>
 <p>“Is it a lot?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it is. To the point I feel like I’m no longer able to pay you back anymore.” Eldest Princess said seriously.</p>
 <p>:Actually, if there really comes a time when you think that you can no longer pay back the favor, you can choose to stop getting indebted to me. That way, you wouldn’t have to pay me back anything.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Yes, but sometimes, I will still think about returning you the favor. Tell me, what can I do to do so?”</p>
 <p>“Do you really want to return this favor to me?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>“Then help me give birth to a child.”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you just die…” Eldest Princess was speechless. She let out her hand and twisted Qing Shui’s mouth with both of her hands. However, Qing Shui went on and hugged her again.</p>
 <p>“Are you addicted to hugging me now?” Eldest Princess asked Qing Shui in confusion while looking at Qing Shui who didn’t do anything too excessive.</p>
 <p>“I feel that this kind of taking advantage is within your acceptable range.”</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess: “......”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After Eldest Princess left, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as it was already the second day.</p>
 <p>The time within the realm was very dull. But Qing Shui was waiting for a chance, the right time for him to refine the energy. To Qing Shui, his battle last time against the Saint Child has brought to him a lot of benefits.</p>
 <p>However, what Qing Shui wanted to do now was to take down the One and Two Yang Pills.</p>
 <p>He didn’t manage to eat it on time. But now, he finally had time to do so. Qing Shui has been having a feeling that both the One and Two Yang Pills would have unique effects towards him. He first swallowed the One Yang Pill.</p>
 <p>A warm feeling emerged within his body and spread around his limbs and bones. Very quickly, he noticed that the bones within his body also seemed to be getting stronger little by little.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it’s quite beneficial to my Nine Yang Golden Body.” Qing Shui was really excited.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, he swallowed the other Two Yang Pill. The amount of strength which a One Yang Pill helped increased was one yang. However, his Nine Yang Golden Body seemed to have gotten stronger than before. Originally, it was supposed to already be at Great Perfection Stage, yet it increased once again.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t weird. There was no limit to the journey of martial arts. Hence, there would be stages even higher than Great Perfection Stage. Just like the Tiger Form which he cultivated in the past, once reaching the Great Perfection Stage, it also broke through quite a number of different stages.</p>
 <p>Upon swallowing the Two Yang Pill, Qing Shui felt as if his entire body was shining with golden light. His meridians were widening. His entire body felt just like a container. And the volume of the container right now was increasing. His Dantian also seemed to be turning a bit vacant. The strength throughout his entire body was condensing down.</p>
