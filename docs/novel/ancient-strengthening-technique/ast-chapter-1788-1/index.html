 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at this charming lady. Many years had passed and yet the time hadn't left a single trace on her face. Back at the Southern City, he had almost lost this lady. She was also a lady who would give up her life for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene where he had met her in the Hundred Miles City, the cauldron that he was using for alchemy, all the way till they had found his family... There had been many things that happened between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I thought that you don't want us anymore. Come, quick, give him a hug. We haven't had a chance to hug him for so many years. Don't you want a hug? Mingyue, come over here." Huoyun Liu-Li grinned and left Qing Shui, pushing Canghai Mingyue into his arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hugged Canghai Mingyue, this poised and dignified lady while looking at Huoyun Liu-Li, who was like a demoness. She was still like her usual self. Qing Shui liked this slightly crafty lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were still other people after all and Canghai Mingyue's face flushed a little. She lifted her head and smiled, looking at Qing Shui, "You're back!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmmm, I missed you. Did you miss me?" Qing Shui said so softly that others won't be able to hear him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I did!" Canghai Mingyue replied softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was back in Qing Shui's previous life, Canghai Mingyue would definitely be someone treated as a Goddess. When Qing Shui first met her, she was on a Golden Winged Thunder Condor, while emitting an unapproachable and pure aura. He never thought that there would be a day where she would become his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he had over 20 children and unknowingly, so many years have passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qingzhuang!" Qing Shui hugged this lady who didn't look as cold as she used to be. She was his first woman and was also the one he had gotten to know first. He knew her since he was still at the Qing Village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you still going to leave after coming back this time around?" Shi Qingzhuang smiled softly. She was just asking, but she knew that there was no way Qing Shui would be able to stop. Right now, he wouldn't be able to get himself out of the things he were involved in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You can't bear to part with me?" Qing Shui looked at this cold beauty. Her beauty was cold and rich, yet also had a hint of courage. She wore a blood red Knight attire and Qing Shui would never get sick of looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right!" Shi Qingzhuang smiled, replying to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll be staying for a bit longer this time around. I'll definitely satisfy you, alright?" Qing Shui said teasingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them spoke, it was in a very soft voice that other people would not be able to hear them. Qing Shui was capable of such a feat at his cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Qingzhuang turned flushed red. She knew what Qing Shui was meant to say when he looked at her with that ambiguous gaze. Feeling shy, she pushed him away and went off to talk to Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took Zhu Qing's hand. This docile yet mature lady was considered the shortest out of all his other women. However, she still had a height of over 1.6 meters. Despite her height, she had a proportional figure and was well-embodied. Her mature and intoxicating charm was especially attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had changed her entire life and now she was a mother of one. She found a sense of belonging in Qing Clan and She was very happy. Seeing his women happy made Qing Shui feel at bliss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Leave the door unlocked for me tonight." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll wait for you, no matter how late you are!" Zhu Qing's beautiful gaze gleamed with a great seductive charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Duan`er!" Qing Shui called out softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Duan hugged Qing Shui tightly. After separated for several years, she had missed him a lot. She was a lady with a lot of reservations, but now, she also hugged Qing Shui very naturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's and Yun Duan's first encounter was very dramatic. Back then, Yun Duan had been sacrificed and ended up having sex with Qing Shui. Qing Shui was her first man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, many things happened later on, which caused Qing Shui to give up on her. Still, he hadn't expected that after many years, he would meet her once again and found out about everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Duan's family and their destiny were also changed after meeting Qing Shui. Otherwise, she wouldn't know how things would end up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Duan was very satisfied with her current life. She now had a man whom she liked and who liked her, had a cute daughter and also was involved in the trade association. If it was in Qing Shui's previous life, she would be considered to have both a great career and a blissful family life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then took Mingyue Gelou's hand. This poised and sacredly beautiful lady had a hint of demonic charm. Her pure-looking features with that blood red mark on her forehead exuded a lethal demonic beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, she had carried Yuchang around to look for a physician and fortunately, came across Qing Shui. Otherwise, Yuchang would have lost her life and she herself would go crazy. Yuchang wasn't Qing Shui's actual child, but he treated her even better than one would to their own child. Moreover, he also didn't harbor any other thoughts just because he wasn't Mingyue Gelou's first man. A lady's character would become even more refined after experiencing some difficulties and would be able to treasure the life even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it wasn't that Qing Shui did not mind about her past, but he could only blame himself for not meeting her earlier and thus she had to be put through those turmoils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also went to see his grandfather, uncle, aunt, and other family members. &nbsp;Qing Zi was the only one from the third generation who was around along with Qing Changfeng as well. He was now at the Early Martial Saint level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a far cry from Qing Zun and Qing Ming, but was also quite outstanding. He could even be called a genius, Qing Clan's genius.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was an exception and shouldn't be taken in comparison. The same went for his women. One large contributing factor to his powerful children was his women's aptitude. Of course, Qing Shui's talent wasn't considered bad either. How bad could his Nine Yang Golden Body be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the others were informed of his return, they would still take several days before they arrived. They would be coming back consecutively over the next few days. However, Qing Shui felt that it would be better for him to bring them back himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of this, Qing Shui told the rest not to inform them. He'd go and bring all of them back over the next two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still early and everyone chatted in the biggest hall, talking about the things that had happened over the past few years. At the start, they got Qing Shui to tell them about his journeys over the past few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yi carried Qing Xiu, her youngest grandchild. Yiye Jiange's elder brother and child were around as well. Yiye Tong had now grown up and the young man who went out to hunt wild beasts back then had now transformed. He now had muscular arms and a thin waist, appearing very capable and had a determined character. His aptitude wasn't bad and when he saw Yiye Jiange, he awkwardly called her 'Aunt'.</span></p>

This is from your uncle."</span></p>

It was quite a good sword and although it was neither of the False God or Legendary grade, it was something which one wouldn't be able to get in the market. After all, it was only one step away from being a legendary grade weapon.</span></p>

Just the materials alone were very precious and even more so was Qing Shui's forging skills. Legendary grade weapons were things in the legend that 99% of cultivators would never live to see. As for Divine Artifacts, they tended to only be possessed by those who were destined to have them.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes lit up and he asked, "It's really for me?"</span></p>

There's no need to thank me. Just focus on your cultivation." Qing Shui smiled and said to Yiye Tong.</span></p>
