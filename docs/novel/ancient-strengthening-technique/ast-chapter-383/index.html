 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 383 - I’ll follow you to the Yan Clan, Elephant Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique!</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, is it time for you to head to the Yan Clan?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Upon hearing Canghai Mingyue’s words, Qing Shui felt a wave of gratitude. This woman had been worrying about his matter all along. He hugged her as he replied, “Yeah, I’m preparing to set off in a month or so.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Uttering this sentence caused Qing Shui to feel a strange sense of peace, as though he had let go of a burden in his heart. However, his blood surged with something akin to anger when he remembered that pitiful silhouette of his sister selling the tea leaves.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strength Qing Shui used to hug Canghai Mingyue unconsciously increased to the point where she felt that her waist would snap apart. His eyes had already turned red as his body trembled violently, as though he was tolerating something.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue placed her hands tenderly on his face as she lightly call out. She could feel Qing Shui losing control.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Gradually, Qing Shui gained control of his emotions, his eyes filled with love and gratitude as he regarded Canghai Mingyue. He boldly, but gently, pressed his forehead against Canghai Mingyue, regarding her from such a close distance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though Canghai Mingyue had been kissed by Qing Shui before, she had never felt so nervous ever in her life. Her heart was pounding rapidly as the somewhat musky smell of a man drifted unceasingly into her nostrils, causing her to be extremely distracted. Qing Shui was the only male that she had been so close to after the death of her father. She wasn’t clear of what she was feeling right now, but she could sense that her heart was willing to walk together with this man down whatever path he chose in the future.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui can I come with you when you storm the Yan Clan?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue softly spoke. The distance at this point was almost non-existent, and Qing Shui could feel the air of her breath on his face whenever she spoke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lightly rejected by shaking his head, the motion causing both of their foreheads to rub together. The smoothness of her skin caused him to marvel in his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Only my mother and I will go to the Yan Clan together. Don’t worry about us.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue silently gaze back into Qing Shui’s eyes. She didn’t say anything, but it was obvious she was feeling disappointed. However, after a while, she nodded and smiled to Qing Shui, “You have to be careful okay, and… have you hugged enough?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No way!” Qing Shui grinned. But after grinning, Qing Shui still relinquished his hold on Canghai Mingyue. He felt that she was the woman that he could have such heart to heart talks with, this kind of emotional exchange sometimes felt better than physical sex.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;…………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Back then after the incident with the Medicinal King Aristocratic Clan, there hadn’t been any more commotion from then. Qing Shui suddenly thought about the palace mistress of the misty hall who had appeared, saving him at the moment of his life and death.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was no way to hide a matter of such commotion from the Medicinal King Aristocratic Clan. After all, Qing Shui knew of how powerful their informant network was. That Elder from before knew that he was from the Heavenly Palace, which was why he disavowed all ties with the Medicinal King Clan before coming to seek revenge on Qing Shui. It was obvious from their actions that they were afraid of antagonising the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From that angle of consideration, it seemed as though there wouldn’t be any more trouble from them, at least temporarily. Also, the appearance of the palace mistress of misty hall had already warn them of something - Qing Shui wasn’t just a nameless elder in the Heavenly Palace!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li went back to her residence and stayed there for three days , after which she stayed over at the Qing Clan’s trading store for another three days before going to explore the Canglang Country with Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Right after the both of them had left, Shi Qingzhuang made an appearance. The timing of her visit hinted that she had purposely waited for them to leave before showing up. Throughout this period of time, Shi Qingzhuang would visit Qing Shui once a week.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It wasn’t known whether it was intentional or accidental, but Shi Qingzhuang hadn’t visited during the days where Canghai Mingyue was present. Back then, when she had been at the Torrid Fragrance Valley, she was told that although her innate talent wasn’t back, she wasn’t suitable for the cultivation methods of the sect. In order not to hold her back, they decided to let Shi Qingzhuang return. No matter what, there was no way Shi Qingzhuang would have ever imagined that the person who helped her break through to Xiantian would be Qing Shui, the first man she ever had.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her fiancée!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the Hundred Miles City, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say nobody was clearer than her in regards to Qing Shui’s matters. She, who had never consoled anyone before, was comforting someone for the very first time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A man that would become her husband in the future!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the ice princess that would soon become his wife. Seeing the gentle smile on her face, Qing Shui felt warm currents flowing in his heart. Even when Shi Qingzhuang was smiling, the feeling she gave off to others still resembled a cool and aloof beauty but it was precisely such a lady that was currently consoling him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After walking to Qing Shui’s side, Shi Qingzhuang regarded him seriously before letting out a melodious laughter. Although this wasn’t the first time Qing Shui had saw her like this, every time she laughed, he would involuntarily feel himself wanting to laugh together with her, like a love-muddled idiot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I shall eat here today.” Shi Qingzhuang smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Even if you want to go, I wouldn’t let you.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them walked side by side towards the backyard. Shi Qingzhuang was only a head shorter compared to Qing Shui, and the two of them looked very compatible with each other when they stood together.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt extremely satisfied having a fiancée as her. He was her first man, and she was also his first woman. Although she wasn’t the more beautiful woman in Qing Shui’s acquaintances, she was the most unforgettable one.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“When are you intending to leave? Are you confident? After all, the Yan Clan could be said to be the ruler of the Yanjiang Country.” Shi Qingzhuang regarded Qing Shui with worry.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, her worry only added to her feminine charm, giving her a unique womanly sensation and making her even more irresistible than before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Soon, in about a month’s time.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can I go with you?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would never have expected Shi Qingzhuang to say such a thing as well. After all, he knew that they knew they wouldn’t be much help. Moreover, from Shi Qingzhuang’s and Canghai Mingyue’s personalities, they wouldn’t initiate such a thing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled at Shi Qingzhuang as he shook his head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Only my mother and I are going” Qing Shui was trying to explain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The journey to the Yan Clan isn’t something that can be covered in a single day. Let me go together, I can take care of Aunty Qing Yi…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang’s words caused Qing Shui to paused as he thought about it. He realized that her words made sense, and after all, Shi Qingzhuang was already a Xiantian lifeform.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hestitated for a moment. After all, he had just rejected Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Would your clan members allow you to go?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“My grandfather has always supported me and wanted me to go with you, however we are not strong enough to assist you in your problems…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing how despondent Shi Qingzhuang was, Qing Shui held onto her snow-white hand. “It’s the thought that count. In any case, you are my wife, and I’m happy that you care about me.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang blushed. Her beauty at this moment was extremely dazzling. She didn’t know what to reply and could only cast her eyes downwards….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">………………...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finished practicing the various martial techniques and qi movements he needed to practice. He had been working extra hard for the past few days. The previous harrowing incidents he had faced made Qing Shui realize the importance of one’s individual power.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he was powerful enough, he wouldn’t have been forced to such a dire straight by a Xiantian back then in the Heavenly River City. If he was powerful enough, he wouldn’t have been forced to the point of death by that elder from the Medicinal King Aristocratic Clan. If he was powerful enough he wouldn’t have easily let Mingyue Gelou being taken away…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he was powerful enough, he wouldn’t have allowed his mother to suffer her inner turmoil for such a long period of time…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After exiting his spatial realm, just when he was about to fall asleep, Qing Shui abruptly remembered that after he consumed that Greencloud Up-step Pellet, there were many things ‘unlocked’ in his sea of consciousness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dived deep into his sea of consciousness and realized that the Elephant Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique had been unlocked. Currently, out of the nine animal forms, Qing Shui had access to Deer, Ape, Tiger, Bear, Crane and now...Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Deer Form only had a Deer Canteering Technique that increased speed. Qing Shui had long integrated the essence of it to his other movement techniques!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for the Ape Form, even though it was unlocked, Qing Shui wasn’t aware of it...hence he actually didn’t learn it…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Of the six Forms, the Tiger Form was what Qing Shui was most proficient in. Although the Bear Form was also at the Great Perfection level and contained immense strength, Qing Shui felt that it was still inferior to the Tiger Form. After all, Qing Shui gained additional insights on the Tiger Form from the stone monuments.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Crouching on the Mountains, Ferocious Tiger Ascending the Mountains, Tiger Roar From the Mountains...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the inner state of ‘Immovable as Mountains’ was invariably connected to the Tiger Form technique, therefore he felt that the Bear Form was still slightly inferior compared to the Tiger Form!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Crane Form was a kind of movement technique. The Crane Step, which further evolved into the Soaring Crane Steps, had reached the Great Perfection level which was slowly integrated during this period of time by Qing Shui into the more complicated ‘Cloudmist Steps’.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that, just like what he had guessed, he had to cultivate a particular form to the Great Perfection level before the technique of the next animal form would be unlocked in his mind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, he felt exceedingly speechless because he could have even forgotten the fact that he had trained in the Ape Form…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But this was just great. He could use the time now to cultivate these two forms. It would be excellent if he could furthered increase in power before he stormed the Yan Clan.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">In the Hundred Miles City, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say nobody was clearer than her in regards to Qing Shui’s matters. She, who had never consoled anyone before, was comforting someone for the very first time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A man that would become her husband in the future!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the ice princess that would soon become his wife. Seeing the gentle smile on her face, Qing Shui felt warm currents flowing in his heart. Even when Shi Qingzhuang was smiling, the feeling she gave off to others still resembled a cool and aloof beauty but it was precisely such a lady that was currently consoling him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After walking to Qing Shui’s side, Shi Qingzhuang regarded him seriously before letting out a melodious laughter. Although this wasn’t the first time Qing Shui had saw her like this, every time she laughed, he would involuntarily feel himself wanting to laugh together with her, like a love-muddled idiot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I shall eat here today.” Shi Qingzhuang smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Even if you want to go, I wouldn’t let you.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them walked side by side towards the backyard. Shi Qingzhuang was only a head shorter compared to Qing Shui, and the two of them looked very compatible with each other when they stood together.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt extremely satisfied having a fiancée as her. He was her first man, and she was also his first woman. Although she wasn’t the more beautiful woman in Qing Shui’s acquaintances, she was the most unforgettable one.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“When are you intending to leave? Are you confident? After all, the Yan Clan could be said to be the ruler of the Yanjiang Country.” Shi Qingzhuang regarded Qing Shui with worry.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, her worry only added to her feminine charm, giving her a unique womanly sensation and making her even more irresistible than before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Soon, in about a month’s time.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can I go with you?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would never have expected Shi Qingzhuang to say such a thing as well. After all, he knew that they knew they wouldn’t be much help. Moreover, from Shi Qingzhuang’s and Canghai Mingyue’s personalities, they wouldn’t initiate such a thing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled at Shi Qingzhuang as he shook his head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Only my mother and I are going” Qing Shui was trying to explain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The journey to the Yan Clan isn’t something that can be covered in a single day. Let me go together, I can take care of Aunty Qing Yi…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang’s words caused Qing Shui to paused as he thought about it. He realized that her words made sense, and after all, Shi Qingzhuang was already a Xiantian lifeform.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hestitated for a moment. After all, he had just rejected Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Would your clan members allow you to go?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“My grandfather has always supported me and wanted me to go with you, however we are not strong enough to assist you in your problems…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing how despondent Shi Qingzhuang was, Qing Shui held onto her snow-white hand. “It’s the thought that count. In any case, you are my wife, and I’m happy that you care about me.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang blushed. Her beauty at this moment was extremely dazzling. She didn’t know what to reply and could only cast her eyes downwards….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">………………...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finished practicing the various martial techniques and qi movements he needed to practice. He had been working extra hard for the past few days. The previous harrowing incidents he had faced made Qing Shui realize the importance of one’s individual power.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he was powerful enough, he wouldn’t have been forced to such a dire straight by a Xiantian back then in the Heavenly River City. If he was powerful enough, he wouldn’t have been forced to the point of death by that elder from the Medicinal King Aristocratic Clan. If he was powerful enough he wouldn’t have easily let Mingyue Gelou being taken away…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he was powerful enough, he wouldn’t have allowed his mother to suffer her inner turmoil for such a long period of time…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After exiting his spatial realm, just when he was about to fall asleep, Qing Shui abruptly remembered that after he consumed that Greencloud Up-step Pellet, there were many things ‘unlocked’ in his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dived deep into his sea of consciousness and realized that the Elephant Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique had been unlocked. Currently, out of the nine animal forms, Qing Shui had access to Deer, Ape, Tiger, Bear, Crane and now...Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Deer Form only had a Deer Canteering Technique that increased speed. Qing Shui had long integrated the essence of it to his other movement techniques!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for the Ape Form, even though it was unlocked, Qing Shui wasn’t aware of it...hence he actually didn’t learn it…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Of the six Forms, the Tiger Form was what Qing Shui was most proficient in. Although the Bear Form was also at the Great Perfection level and contained immense strength, Qing Shui felt that it was still inferior to the Tiger Form. After all, Qing Shui gained additional insights on the Tiger Form from the stone monuments.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Crouching on the Mountains, Ferocious Tiger Ascending the Mountains, Tiger Roar From the Mountains...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the inner state of ‘Immovable as Mountains’ was invariably connected to the Tiger Form technique, therefore he felt that the Bear Form was still slightly inferior compared to the Tiger Form!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Crane Form was a kind of movement technique. The Crane Step, which further evolved into the Soaring Crane Steps, had reached the Great Perfection level which was slowly integrated during this period of time by Qing Shui into the more complicated ‘Cloudmist Steps’.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that, just like what he had guessed, he had to cultivate a particular form to the Great Perfection level before the technique of the next animal form would be unlocked in his mind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, he felt exceedingly speechless because he could have even forgotten the fact that he had trained in the Ape Form…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But this was just great. He could use the time now to cultivate these two forms. It would be excellent if he could furthered increase in power before he stormed the Yan Clan.</p>
