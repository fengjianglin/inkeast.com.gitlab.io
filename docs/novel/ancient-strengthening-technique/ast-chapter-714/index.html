 <p><strong>AST 714 - Destruction of Luo Clan, Hai Dongqing's Thoughts(1)</strong></p>
 <p>Seeing how Luo Di had been forced back by Qing Shui to this extent. Everyone around was stunned, especially upon seeing that one of Luo Di's arms had been cut off by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Another thing was the fact that Qing Shui's mastery of the hammer seemed to be higher than that of Luo Di's. The sudden turning of the tables was too unexpected, especially for those from Luo Clan who had specially come over to Hai Clan... All of them had faces as pale as sheets.</p>
 <p>Although Hai Clan's people were also surprised, it was a happy surprise. They had held great hopes for Qing Shui but still had not expected the outcome to be such a happy one.</p>
 <p>At this point, Hai Dongqing secretly let out a sigh of relief. She knew that everything was going to be put to an end. This unexpected happy result gave her a feeling of being in a dream.</p>
 <p>Subconsciously, a dazzling smile appeared on her face. The gloomy sky seemed to have also been affected by her smiles, showing a hint of light.</p>
 <p>Hai Tian's hands were trembling. He was already very excited when Qing Shui killed that bear, but now he was overwhelmed with joy and excitement. Even if he were to die, he would be able to do so in peace. His mind was set at ease now.</p>
 <p>The people from Hai Clan who were left all wore fanatical expressions. Back when they decided to leave, they had all done so with the expectation of dying here, together with Hai Clan. However, the results turned out to be over their expectations. Those people who had left Hai Clan must all be extremely regretful of their decisions. Now, they wouldn't dare come back even if they wish to do so.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Heaven Smashing Strike!</p>
 <p>This was a move of the Heaven Shaking Hammer. However, when he used the "Thunder God" to perform this move, the prowess seemed to be even bigger. Slamming one hammer attack on Luo Di's swaying Thunder God, with a deep sound, the Thunder God left his hand.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, Qing Shui prepared himself to bring down another slam. There was no skillful technique to this attack. There was only speed and brutality. It was because Luo Di who had lost his Thunder God was no longer able to receive this attack. His powers had once again been reduced by half.</p>
 <p>Facing Luo Di's pale countenance, Qing Shui's Thunder God landed a strong blow on his neck, causing it to explode, leaving only faint blood trails and blood stench in the air.</p>
 <p>Luo Di had died!</p>
 <p>Luo Clan's strongest expert had died. Everything was over for them. Qing Shui calmly picked up the other Thunder God which had fallen to the ground.</p>
 <p>This pair of "Thunder God" were now too important to Qing Shui. Or rather, just one of them. Qing Shui intended to use only one each time he used hammers. It was a perfect match together with the Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>The Thunder God was created from the Thunder Rock, which was also considered a treasure. Now, at Qing Shui's level, even if he were to get hold of a Thunder Rock, he wouldn't be able to forge a weapon of the Thunder God's level, not with his current abilities.</p>
 <p>Most Thunder Rocks were found high in the mountains, in areas where lightning often struck. Most rocks are unable to withstand the impact from lightning strikes and thus it must be those rocks of at least 10,000 of age, and wouldn't lose out to rocks like the 10,000-year coldsteel or moonstones.</p>
 <p>The conditions required for the formation of the Thunder Rocks were too harsh. Although there was not just one Thunder God, there weren't many of them. Moreover, it had a unique paralyzing ability and was considered a powerful existence amongst weapons of the False God Tier. Moreover, the effect this Thunder God had wasn't something that could be activated with every attack.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept one of the Thunder God in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Having gained a treasure, Qing Shui was in a great mood. He then turned his gaze toward the remaining Luo Clan members.</p>
 <p>"Let's fight it out with him. There's no way that he'd let us off. If we want a chance of surviving this, we must kill him!" That old man from Luo Clan suddenly let out a loud bellow and took the lead to dash out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The elegant looking old man from Luo Clan who was third in rank also dashed out without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui weakened their abilities without any panic, before stomping down with a Mighty Elephant Stomp. When dealing with these people, Qing Shui had no plans to let them off. He called out the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens!</p>
 <p>These cultivators who had been weakened by Qing Shui had no ways of fending off the Fire Bird's Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens. Qing Shui, with the Thunder God, was simply a killing demon. With each hammer attack, a life would be killed. The Fire Bird on the other hand, would burn everything here into ashes. The Fire Bird's massacre was even faster than Qing Shui's.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, everything here returned to its originally peaceful state. This time around, Qing Shui had been faced with the most powerful opponent he had ever come across and he had a complete victory, without suffering any injuries.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned toward the Hai Clan members who were walking toward him. Looking at the bunch of Hai Clan members who were very agitated, Qing Shui was very happy as well. He smiled at Hai Tian and said, "Old Master Hai can arrange for someone to clean up the mess. I won't take part in this."</p>
 <p>"Alright. When everything's done, all the items will be yours. And our Hai Clan will remember this debt that we owe you." Hai Tian furrowed his brows and said with a smile. He was very sincere. He didn't know how to thank Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"No need for that. This time around, I was just repaying Miss Dongqing for her help. Those items are a gift for Miss Dongqing." Qing Shui shook his head, smiled and said.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui said this, there was nothing else that Hai Tian could say. Everyone turned their gazes toward Hai Dongqing who was walking toward them. There was a knowing look in their gazes,</p>
 <p>Toward these, Qing Shui could only smile helplessly. It wasn't their fault to have thought of this. Earlier, Hai Dongqing had hugged him in agitation and had even blocked a lethal blow for him from the Spirit Slaying at the risk of her own life. These all indicated many things. If someone were to say that there was nothing between the two of them, even Qing Shui wouldn't be able to believe it.</p>
 <p>However, the truth was, there was really nothing between them.</p>
 <p>"Is your hand still in pain?" Qing Shui asked gently. For a lady to be willing to go to such extent for him, although he was helping her, this act still strummed a string in his heart.</p>
 <p>"No, not at all. It's all fine now." Hai Dongqing gave a relaxed smile. She had finally put down a heavy burden in her heart, and gained felt relieved both physically and mentally.</p>
 <p>There was only one thing which she felt had changed. The image of someone would occasionally pop into her mind. It was a very strange feeling, one that made her yearn to see him.</p>
 <p>As the respective thoughts went through their minds, they were both rendered speechless. The rest of the people had left to settle the aftermath, and left Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing to be alone.</p>
 <p>"How much longer can you stay in Cold Ice City?" Hai Dongqing knew that Qing Shui was here to look for Immortal Fox's blood and had only extended his stay in order to help her out. Now that everything was settled, it was naturally time for him to leave.</p>
 <p>"About three to five days. Now that everything has been settled, you must stay happy. If you've come across any troubles, you can send me a letter." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had actually only said this out of courtesy since it wouldn't be that easy for Hai Dongqing to look for him. After all, he had no idea where he would be going next. However, he should be making a trip back to Greencloud Continent first.</p>
 <p>"Then how about I bring you around to some interesting places in Cold Ice City during these few days?" Hai Dongqing smiled and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"That sounds great."</p>
 <p>It was about to be noon soon. Qing Shui said to Hai Dongqing, "Come, let's go back. It's about time for lunch."</p>
 <p>"I want to eat something you cook." Hai Dongqing smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"What's so difficult about that? I'll go let the others know. I'll also go take a look at those Four Eared Shadow Mice. " Qing Shui smiled at Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>"Mmm!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened the Demon Refining Furnace and noticed that all ten Four Eared Shadow Mice had disappeared, leaving behind three crystal cards. Qing Shui felt stunned. To think that he had succeeded even though he had barely put in much effort. This might be related to the Four Eared Shadow Mice cultivation level. Although their speed as well as their teeth were terrifying, the Core were not very powerful. Demon refinings were dependent on aura exuded by the beasts' Core.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing bade their farewells to Hai Tian before returning to Hai Dongqing's place.</p>
 <p>They could only head for the pavilion building with the other building collapsed.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing's hand was injured, so she could only watched as Qing Shui cooked. Today, Qing Shui felt very happy. At least for now, he felt very relaxed. It was because the things here were now all settled. Hai Dongqing had helped him find Immortal Fox's blood and he had repaid his debt to her. The things here have all be settled.</p>
 <p>He had never expected that he would meet Hai Dongqing here. Back in Greencloud Continent, he felt that they had an affinity. When they came across each other in Cold Ice City, even Qing Shui, who didn't believe in fate, now believed in it.</p>
 <p>To be meeting someone he knew in a foreign land... They had even become friends very quickly. In the past they were not friends but now they could definitely be considered friends.</p>
 <p>There were many kinds of friends but after they had been through all this, they could be considered friends who had gone through life and death trials together. They now felt that the other party had now taken a spot in their heart. Qing Shui didn't know that Hai Dongqing's image of him in her heart was like a portrait, one that she couldn't ever forget.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made a very great lunch, filling the entire building with an intoxicating fragrance, spreading out across the small table.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, there's only two of us. How can we finish all this?" Hai Dongqing looked at all the dishes and asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Your hand's injured, you need more nourishment. Eat more." Qing Shui smiled and passed Hai Dongqing utensils.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing was a bit speechless but she still felt very happy.</p>
 <p>"Your hand's hurt, shall I feed you?" Qing Shui said slightly teasingly as he suddenly recalled her injury when passing her utensils.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, you don't sound sincere at all. Today, you must do what you've said you would." Hai Dongqing didn't receive the utensils but just said to Qing Shui when she saw his insincere expression. There was a hint of complication reflected in her eyes. When Qing Shui saw that, he felt a little uneasy. He wasn't sure that Hai Dongqing liked him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said without the twitch of an eye, "It's my honor to be able to feed a beauty like you."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat opposite Hai Dongqing. The table was not very big and was rectangular. When both of them were seated, the distance between the two of them was merely about one foot. The table's width was only sufficient to put about two plates.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui agreed, Hai Dongqing's face quickly flushed up. Her beautiful face was immediately filled with endless seductive charms.</p>
 <p>Especially when Qing Shui had brought food up to her mouth, she started to panic even more. She slightly opened her beautiful mouth. When Qing Shui's chopsticks met her soft and tender lips, that amazing feeling caused his hand to tremble a little, as did his heart.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing ate very little. When she drank soup, she held a small spoon with her left hand. The blush on her face didn't pass and it was only now that she started to feel embarrassed over her daring move earlier.</p>
 <p>However, she knew that if she didn't take the initiative, Qing Shui would never take the initiative. During this period of time together with Qing Shui, she could sense that. She could even sense that he seemed to be slightly pushing her aside.</p>
