 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 514 - Rebirth, Activating the physical potential of the body</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Every cloud has a silver lining. If you have the will, the ability to endure hardships, and a little bit of luck, nothing is impossible.” Lin Zhanhan was wreathed with smiles as he took out a pale yellow book from his chest pocket.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A few encouraging words were said to carry a lot of weight to those who were met with dejection. Perhaps this was what they called as ‘trying anything in desperate situations’ or ‘grasping at straws?’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is an ancient book called &lt;Rebirth&gt; that my grandfather had somehow acquired. This can help you tremendously at times like this. I am giving this to you, whether you can succeed, will depend upon your resolution and creativity. Back then, my grandfather used this «Rebirth» to recover everything he had lost, taking his cultivation to a new level.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gazed at the pale yellow ancient book and looked at Lin Zhanhan suspiciously and said: “Grandpa Lin, why didn't you use this ancient book &lt;Rebirth&gt; to recover your strength?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has been dying to ask that question. Lin Zhanhan’s injuries may be less severe than Qing Shui, but he hasn't been recovering at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, then I will tell you why. This ancient book is only suitable for those who had lost all paths in life. This is a cultivation method that allows one to “fight desperately in the face of death for the sake of living.” In other words, this book helps to trigger the most instinctive potential of the human body.” Lin Zhanhan flashed a smile at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, this kind of ‘cultivation’ will only bring you more suffering, or even endanger your life at all times. But you have the ‘Stone of Life,’ so it is up to you whether you are able to endure this kind of hardship and trigger the most instinctive potential inside your body. Here, catch.” Lin Zhanhan threw the ancient book at Qing Shui as he finished talking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo remained silent while he stood beside them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather, please don’t tell mother that I only have three years to live.” Qing Shui said softly as he faced Qing Luo.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Okay, I understand. Try your best for the sake of your mother.” Qing Luo gazed at Qing Shui with a warm smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin, this is for you. This should be able to recover your strength to how it was before. You might even gain extra strength from this.” Qing Shui took out the last Great Revitalizing Pellet and gave it to Lin Zhanhan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘Mercy’ had been an occurring theme in the battle of life and death during his lifetime of frustration. His heart was still beating fast even after hearing the kind words Qing Shui said to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It has been a long time since he felt this way. He would never think that one day someone would say these words to him. Lin Zhanhan stared blankly at Qing Shui as he received the jar containing the Great Revitalizing Pellet with trembling hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin, keep in mind that you will be in a state of weakness for a month after consuming the pellet. You will become somewhat like an ordinary people with no martial skills. However, you will be able to recover completely during this time.” Qing Shui reminded him as he was afraid that Lin Zhanhan would feel intimidated by the one month period of weakness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have been weak since long time ago. It’s just one month, I can take it. Heck, I will still consume it even if it takes me ten years to recover.” Lin Zhanhan said in a quavering voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He would never saw this day coming after many years of being feeble!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then, should I consume it now?” Lin Zhanhan looked at Qing Shui with anticipation. After all, he would feel more relieved if he could consume the pellet right away. Moreover, he would be able to see what kind of side-effects he should be cautious about.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure, why not!” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan opened the jar and scanned the contents for a moment. Then, he tilted his head backwards and gulped down the pellet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the time of half-a-cup tea-drinking session had passed, Lin Zhanhan’s body emitted a faint glow of light. His forehead began to sweat as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo looked at Lin Zhanhan with worried eyes, while Qing Shui remained silent. Qing Shui already knew what was going on - Lin Zhanhan’s injuries, severed meridians, and dantian were healing all by itself. During this time, it was normal for him to experience pain around the body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan bit his lips while trying his best to endure the pain. As a result, his clothes were drenched in his sweat. Despite that, his body began to emanate a strong aura, which Qing Shui found somewhat unbearable after he had lost the foundation of his cultivation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan let out a roaring laugh. He had tears in his eyes as he continued laughing blissfully!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I should thank you for this.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew he had already recovered his cultivation bases when he saw how happy Lin Zhanhan was. It seemed that Lin Clan would be safer with a reborn Peak Martial King assuming his duty together with Di Chen to protect them from other clans.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan’s wish had been fulfilled. Qing Shui did what he could for Lin Zhanhan despite having lost all his power previously. It wasn’t an easy task for him either seeing someone else recovering their strength. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This may be another kind of wish fulfillment, I suppose!” Qing Shui tried to console himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin, it’s good to see that you have recovered.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Congratulations, brother Lin!” Qing Luo was also happy at Lin Zhanhan’s recovery.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After bidding the elders goodbye, Qing Shui brought the ancient book &lt;Rebirth&gt; back to Qing Residence where he could take his time learning how to activate the physical potential of his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t wait to read the book, so he went straight to his bedroom without even greeting the women in the residence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He locked his door as soon as he went inside his room!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on his desk with anticipation and excitement as he flipped open the ancient book.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&lt;Rebirth&gt; was a path designed to activate the physical potential of a human body. It was also considered as a defiance of natural order, deadly, and life threatening….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui read the prologue of the ancient book that mainly stated &lt;Rebirth&gt; as a method to not only activate the physical potential of the body, but the potential hidden within the deeper parts of the body as well. This method would be able to heal any damages within the body and re-ignite one’s life force.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew all too well about the hidden potential even before he was transcended to this dimension. It was said that a mother had her one-year old child stolen from her arms by a person riding a motorcycle. Under the circumstances where her child was suddenly kidnapped from her, the mother had unknowingly activated her hidden potential, which allowed her to catch up to the kidnapper at an unprecedented speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One’s power would increase tremendously once the hidden potential had been unlocked and activated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also noticed the following pages were mainly filled with pictures. These pictures seemed to be in an animated in sequence, with the first one being a man in a running motion while sweating profusely!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No wonder Lin Zhanhan said this ancient book would be appropriate for someone like him. Running? Only the most common people in the World of Nine Continents would do something as trivial as running. Nevertheless, Qing Shui continued staring at the running man in the picture.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After analyzing for the time of one cup tea-drinking session, Qing Shui noticed something peculiar about the picture - it was the expression on the man’s face. As he was running with sweat drenched on his back, his complexion, spirit, body, and movements were presented in a perfect stance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was graceful!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was trying to grasp something in his mind, but he was still uncertain. He continued to the second picture, which showed the man had stopped running and was lying on the ground with his eyes closed tightly. The sweat from the man was gushing out like a waterfall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Activating his potential? Exhausting his life force?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He also knew that &lt;Rebirth&gt; was a method designed to put a person in a dire situation of life and death so he would desperately try to live.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept reading, and then he saw the man in the picture carrying a heavy load while running….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was also an illustration of the man in a horse stance under a gigantic waterfall….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He strolled along the hot volcano and the blades….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These were the proper steps of an ordinary people’s steady progress towards cultivation. Qing Shui has spotted a similarity in all these pictures - the man in the picture would always have a close connection of Essence, Qi, and Spirit in his movement and posture. He admired the energy displayed by the man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was instantly reminded of the Old Ancestor in the Heavenly Palace because of his skills. He decided to put the ancient book inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and began his recovery right away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was aware that this method would help him towards his recovery, but he wasn’t very hopeful about it. He decided to try it since there were no other ways he could think of to gain back his cultivation. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Activating the deepest potential of the body was considered one of the greatest aspect to self-recovery. Whether one had a better qualification or better body condition, there would always be other factors affecting the activation of the physical potential of the body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A strong body and the rate of healing would also somewhat be affected by the activation of the body’s potential.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If the body's potential was strong enough, the regeneration of a damaged body would be possible. Qing Shui was excited as he thought about the possibility of regaining his cultivation. If he was able to succeed activating his potential, not only would he recover his former strength, but he would also become stronger than he was ever before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked out from the Qing Residence into the neighboring mountain and started running. When he started, he let his heart, spirit, and footwork become one. Even though he had lost his cultivation, he still had the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, &nbsp;and he was still able to react with full awareness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Eventually, the sky had turned dark!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was at this moment that Qing Shui began to close his eyes, as if he was squinting. His body felt like it had been washed up by the waters while he remained composed and calm. The moon was hung on the west side of the sky shining the area with its light.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And then, a thumping sound rang out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui flopped on the ground!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was as if he had just awoken from his slumber. As he regained his consciousness, he realized his body was feeling sore. His lips were chapped and had bled a little, and he couldn’t move his muscles either.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a couple of women appeared before him. Qing Shui flashed a bitter smile when he saw all of them surrounding him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t touch him, he will feel better if he lies down for a while.” Di Chen gently interrupted when Huoyun Liu-Li was about to hold Qing Shui up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing crouched down beside Qing Shui as she called him out with a gentle voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, am I useless?” Qing Shui forced a smile on his face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are and will always be the hero in my heart. Having you as my little brother has always been the greatest pride of my life.” Qing Qing gently wiped away Qing Shui’s tears as she reassured him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, what has gotten into you? Don’t scare us like that.” Huoyun Liu-Li was concerned as she sat beside Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will be fine. I will attempt to recover again. If I’m lucky, I will be able to recover soon.” Qing Shui grinned. After all, he needed to assure them that he would always appreciate their love and support.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Really?” All of them asked simultaneously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was how Qing Shui had spent his first day on the path to recovery!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For the remaining days, Qing Shui would always be left in a semi-conscious state as he ran aimlessly without stopping until he reached the other side of the mountain. However, he was able to successfully synchronize the Essence, Qi, and Spirit as a singular &nbsp;being. Qing Shui used to able to barely touch the bottleneck of the realm, but now he was able to get hold of it easily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui was able to overdraw his power and vitality quite easily while waiting for the completion of his self-regeneration. He was beginning to understand the key to his recovery.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The key was to be able to take control of the synchronization of the Essence, Qi, and Spirit. However, it would be extremely dangerous to do so, and it would be difficult to maintain control without the ‘Stone of Life.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Half a year had passed. Qing Shui seemed to have found the core of the the method, and had begun to noticed the changes on his body. However, he could not pinpoint the exact changes no matter how hard he tried. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had now taken up running while carrying a heavy load across the mountain. He used to be proficient in the art of gentleness, but after his meridians were damaged, his physical strength was lost in the process.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s load totaled to about 40 jin, which was already strenuous to his body. Qing Shui laughed bitterly at himself. When he was at his peak, he had about the strength of “13 countries” combined, but now….&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Half a year has passed by again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under a gigantic waterfall located a hundred miles away from Qing Village, a young man was closing his eyes while in a horse stance. He was enduring the extreme pressure of the thundering waterfall with all his might.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has been dying to ask that question. Lin Zhanhan’s injuries may be less severe than Qing Shui, but he hasn't been recovering at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, then I will tell you why. This ancient book is only suitable for those who had lost all paths in life. This is a cultivation method that allows one to “fight desperately in the face of death for the sake of living.” In other words, this book helps to trigger the most instinctive potential of the human body.” Lin Zhanhan flashed a smile at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, this kind of ‘cultivation’ will only bring you more suffering, or even endanger your life at all times. But you have the ‘Stone of Life,’ so it is up to you whether you are able to endure this kind of hardship and trigger the most instinctive potential inside your body. Here, catch.” Lin Zhanhan threw the ancient book at Qing Shui as he finished talking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo remained silent while he stood beside them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather, please don’t tell mother that I only have three years to live.” Qing Shui said softly as he faced Qing Luo.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Okay, I understand. Try your best for the sake of your mother.” Qing Luo gazed at Qing Shui with a warm smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin, this is for you. This should be able to recover your strength to how it was before. You might even gain extra strength from this.” Qing Shui took out the last Great Revitalizing Pellet and gave it to Lin Zhanhan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘Mercy’ had been an occurring theme in the battle of life and death during his lifetime of frustration. His heart was still beating fast even after hearing the kind words Qing Shui said to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It has been a long time since he felt this way. He would never think that one day someone would say these words to him. Lin Zhanhan stared blankly at Qing Shui as he received the jar containing the Great Revitalizing Pellet with trembling hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin, keep in mind that you will be in a state of weakness for a month after consuming the pellet. You will become somewhat like an ordinary people with no martial skills. However, you will be able to recover completely during this time.” Qing Shui reminded him as he was afraid that Lin Zhanhan would feel intimidated by the one month period of weakness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have been weak since long time ago. It’s just one month, I can take it. Heck, I will still consume it even if it takes me ten years to recover.” Lin Zhanhan said in a quavering voice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He would never saw this day coming after many years of being feeble!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then, should I consume it now?” Lin Zhanhan looked at Qing Shui with anticipation. After all, he would feel more relieved if he could consume the pellet right away. Moreover, he would be able to see what kind of side-effects he should be cautious about.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure, why not!” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan opened the jar and scanned the contents for a moment. Then, he tilted his head backwards and gulped down the pellet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the time of half-a-cup tea-drinking session had passed, Lin Zhanhan’s body emitted a faint glow of light. His forehead began to sweat as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo looked at Lin Zhanhan with worried eyes, while Qing Shui remained silent. Qing Shui already knew what was going on - Lin Zhanhan’s injuries, severed meridians, and dantian were healing all by itself. During this time, it was normal for him to experience pain around the body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan bit his lips while trying his best to endure the pain. As a result, his clothes were drenched in his sweat. Despite that, his body began to emanate a strong aura, which Qing Shui found somewhat unbearable after he had lost the foundation of his cultivation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan let out a roaring laugh. He had tears in his eyes as he continued laughing blissfully!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I should thank you for this.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew he had already recovered his cultivation bases when he saw how happy Lin Zhanhan was. It seemed that Lin Clan would be safer with a reborn Peak Martial King assuming his duty together with Di Chen to protect them from other clans.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan’s wish had been fulfilled. Qing Shui did what he could for Lin Zhanhan despite having lost all his power previously. It wasn’t an easy task for him either seeing someone else recovering their strength. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This may be another kind of wish fulfillment, I suppose!” Qing Shui tried to console himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin, it’s good to see that you have recovered.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Congratulations, brother Lin!” Qing Luo was also happy at Lin Zhanhan’s recovery.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After bidding the elders goodbye, Qing Shui brought the ancient book &lt;Rebirth&gt; back to Qing Residence where he could take his time learning how to activate the physical potential of his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t wait to read the book, so he went straight to his bedroom without even greeting the women in the residence!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He locked his door as soon as he went inside his room!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on his desk with anticipation and excitement as he flipped open the ancient book.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&lt;Rebirth&gt; was a path designed to activate the physical potential of a human body. It was also considered as a defiance of natural order, deadly, and life threatening….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui read the prologue of the ancient book that mainly stated &lt;Rebirth&gt; as a method to not only activate the physical potential of the body, but the potential hidden within the deeper parts of the body as well. This method would be able to heal any damages within the body and re-ignite one’s life force.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew all too well about the hidden potential even before he was transcended to this dimension. It was said that a mother had her one-year old child stolen from her arms by a person riding a motorcycle. Under the circumstances where her child was suddenly kidnapped from her, the mother had unknowingly activated her hidden potential, which allowed her to catch up to the kidnapper at an unprecedented speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One’s power would increase tremendously once the hidden potential had been unlocked and activated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also noticed the following pages were mainly filled with pictures. These pictures seemed to be in an animated in sequence, with the first one being a man in a running motion while sweating profusely!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No wonder Lin Zhanhan said this ancient book would be appropriate for someone like him. Running? Only the most common people in the World of Nine Continents would do something as trivial as running. Nevertheless, Qing Shui continued staring at the running man in the picture.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After analyzing for the time of one cup tea-drinking session, Qing Shui noticed something peculiar about the picture - it was the expression on the man’s face. As he was running with sweat drenched on his back, his complexion, spirit, body, and movements were presented in a perfect stance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was graceful!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was trying to grasp something in his mind, but he was still uncertain. He continued to the second picture, which showed the man had stopped running and was lying on the ground with his eyes closed tightly. The sweat from the man was gushing out like a waterfall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Activating his potential? Exhausting his life force?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He also knew that &lt;Rebirth&gt; was a method designed to put a person in a dire situation of life and death so he would desperately try to live.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept reading, and then he saw the man in the picture carrying a heavy load while running….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was also an illustration of the man in a horse stance under a gigantic waterfall….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He strolled along the hot volcano and the blades….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These were the proper steps of an ordinary people’s steady progress towards cultivation. Qing Shui has spotted a similarity in all these pictures - the man in the picture would always have a close connection of Essence, Qi, and Spirit in his movement and posture. He admired the energy displayed by the man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was instantly reminded of the Old Ancestor in the Heavenly Palace because of his skills. He decided to put the ancient book inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and began his recovery right away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was aware that this method would help him towards his recovery, but he wasn’t very hopeful about it. He decided to try it since there were no other ways he could think of to gain back his cultivation. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Activating the deepest potential of the body was considered one of the greatest aspect to self-recovery. Whether one had a better qualification or better body condition, there would always be other factors affecting the activation of the physical potential of the body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A strong body and the rate of healing would also somewhat be affected by the activation of the body’s potential.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If the body's potential was strong enough, the regeneration of a damaged body would be possible. Qing Shui was excited as he thought about the possibility of regaining his cultivation. If he was able to succeed activating his potential, not only would he recover his former strength, but he would also become stronger than he was ever before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked out from the Qing Residence into the neighboring mountain and started running. When he started, he let his heart, spirit, and footwork become one. Even though he had lost his cultivation, he still had the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, &nbsp;and he was still able to react with full awareness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Eventually, the sky had turned dark!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was at this moment that Qing Shui began to close his eyes, as if he was squinting. His body felt like it had been washed up by the waters while he remained composed and calm. The moon was hung on the west side of the sky shining the area with its light.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And then, a thumping sound rang out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui flopped on the ground!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was as if he had just awoken from his slumber. As he regained his consciousness, he realized his body was feeling sore. His lips were chapped and had bled a little, and he couldn’t move his muscles either.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a couple of women appeared before him. Qing Shui flashed a bitter smile when he saw all of them surrounding him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t touch him, he will feel better if he lies down for a while.” Di Chen gently interrupted when Huoyun Liu-Li was about to hold Qing Shui up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing crouched down beside Qing Shui as she called him out with a gentle voice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, am I useless?” Qing Shui forced a smile on his face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are and will always be the hero in my heart. Having you as my little brother has always been the greatest pride of my life.” Qing Qing gently wiped away Qing Shui’s tears as she reassured him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, what has gotten into you? Don’t scare us like that.” Huoyun Liu-Li was concerned as she sat beside Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will be fine. I will attempt to recover again. If I’m lucky, I will be able to recover soon.” Qing Shui grinned. After all, he needed to assure them that he would always appreciate their love and support.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Really?” All of them asked simultaneously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was how Qing Shui had spent his first day on the path to recovery!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For the remaining days, Qing Shui would always be left in a semi-conscious state as he ran aimlessly without stopping until he reached the other side of the mountain. However, he was able to successfully synchronize the Essence, Qi, and Spirit as a singular &nbsp;being. Qing Shui used to able to barely touch the bottleneck of the realm, but now he was able to get hold of it easily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui was able to overdraw his power and vitality quite easily while waiting for the completion of his self-regeneration. He was beginning to understand the key to his recovery.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The key was to be able to take control of the synchronization of the Essence, Qi, and Spirit. However, it would be extremely dangerous to do so, and it would be difficult to maintain control without the ‘Stone of Life.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Half a year had passed. Qing Shui seemed to have found the core of the the method, and had begun to noticed the changes on his body. However, he could not pinpoint the exact changes no matter how hard he tried. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had now taken up running while carrying a heavy load across the mountain. He used to be proficient in the art of gentleness, but after his meridians were damaged, his physical strength was lost in the process.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s load totaled to about 40 jin, which was already strenuous to his body. Qing Shui laughed bitterly at himself. When he was at his peak, he had about the strength of “13 countries” combined, but now….&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Half a year has passed by again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under a gigantic waterfall located a hundred miles away from Qing Village, a young man was closing his eyes while in a horse stance. He was enduring the extreme pressure of the thundering waterfall with all his might.</p>
