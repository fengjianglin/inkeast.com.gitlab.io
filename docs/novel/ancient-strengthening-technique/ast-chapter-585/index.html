 <p><strong>AST 585 - The Success of Aroma Concentration Pill, Visitors From The Central Continent</strong></p>
 <p>“Sister Chen. I’m just saying this, but if I am going to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord in the future, would you be sad?” Qing Shui remembered he might need to go to the Central Continent after breaking through. He had to repay what he had been through. He could never forget the face of the Sky Tyrant Lord and his disdainful look.</p>
 <p>“I am not related to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord in any way. They have never treated me sincerely, so there is no reason for me to be obstinate about this. The Di Clan, Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and I are not related in any way. My name is still Di Chen because this is the name my mother has given to me,” Di Chen lifted her head up and looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt relieved in his heart. He couldn’t really do much if Di Chen still thought fondly of that home. But seeing how she had left that place for so long, he knew that she shouldn’t be on a very good terms with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and the two were most likely very tense around each other.</p>
 <p>He also knew that the affairs between them weren’t that simple from the words that the Sky Tyrant Lord had said before he left. Maybe he had not finished him off before because he had already considered him as good as a dead person.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea if the commotion he had caused this time was a good or bad thing. He kept having the feeling that something was going to happen, and that it was going to involve him and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was aware that his current strength was inadequate to go against the Sky Tyrant Lord because he had estimated that his strength was either at Grade Two Martial Saint level or only at peak of Grade One Martial Saint level.</p>
 <p>Nian Feng’s grandfather had mentioned that there was a Martial Saint Grade Four being in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. He didn’t know if there were any beings of higher level than that either, so all Qing Shui could do was wait and quickly increase his strength.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do not hurry. You are still not at the level to confront the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. With your talent, your chances will be greater if you wait a little longer,” Di Chen quickly said after seeing the facial expression on Qing Shui’s face.</p>
 <p>“I know. Don’t worry, Sister Chen. Just you wait a little longer. I will bring you to the Di Clan very soon,” Qing Shui said in determination.</p>
 <p>Di Chen smiled at Qing Shui and then lowered her head to look at the little one in her arms. “Just the thought is more than enough. You still need to give her happiness as you are her support. The responsibilities on your shoulders will grow heavier.”</p>
 <p>“I will be able to do it. Trust me.”</p>
 <p>Di Chen was startled. She nodded at Qing Shui. “You are a wise person, I hope you won’t be reckless about this. Otherwise I can’t even bear to face them.”</p>
 <p>Di Chen smiled and pointed to the little lass in her arms.</p>
 <p>In the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was diligently concocting medicinal pills because he was about to get the ‘Aroma Concentration Pill’ recipe soon. Although this pill only required an experience of 200,000, he still had some hope for it. It shouldn’t be more inferior than the Small Revitalizing Pellet.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped as soon as he heard a familiar noise ringing out. He calmly immersed himself into his sea of consciousness and searched for the new Aroma Concentrating Pill recipe.</p>
 <p>Ingredients: 1,000-Year Golden Turtle Grass, 1,000-Year Milkvetch, 1,000-Year Fleeceflower Root, 1,000-Year Requiem Grass, Hundred Color Flower, 1,000-Year Beast Blood, Violet Powder, Twin-headed Fish, Twin-headed Turtle, 100-Year Turtle Shell, Purifying Lotus.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a breath of relief after he finished reading the recipe. He could immediately get all of these ingredients out right now. The medicinal herbs that he had collected in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal were fairly abundant already. He felt extremely satisfied being able to instantly retrieve all the ingredients stated on the recipe.</p>
 <p>He was going to substitute the Twin-headed Fish and Twin-headed Turtle with 6,000 Year Golden Medicinal Turtle and Golden Pearl Essence of the more than 2,000 Year Clam. The Violet Powder can be substituted with Blood of the 1000 Year Clam while the rest were all available within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>He happily continued reading the effects of the medicine pill next!</p>
 <p>Effect: While asleep, the speed of cultivation is doubled, compared to cultivating while awake. Every pill lasts for six hours. Only one can be consumed every 24 hours.</p>
 <p>Stunned, dumbfounded… Qing Shui didn’t know how to describe his feelings. This Aroma Concentration Pill had basically just indicated that it was possible to cultivate while sleeping. During those six hours, the speed of cultivation was twice that of cultivating during the normal hours. And the effect of Aroma Concentration Pill could last only six hours everyday.</p>
 <p>One Aroma Concentration pill would amount to an average person’s hard work in a day. Six hours, double the effects… This medicinal pill was quite powerful. He could use the Spirit Concentrating Pill when he wasn’t sleeping and ingest the Aroma Concentration Pill before he slept.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui placed his gaze at the bottom of it. The gap to the next Meridians Strengthening Pellet still required one million experience points!</p>
 <p>He read again. There was no mistake that it was the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet. On top of that, it required a whopping one million experience points. The Ren Meridian was one of the biggest eight meridians in the human body, and it was also one of the most important meridians.</p>
 <p>TL Note: The Ren Meridian is also known as the Conception Vessel.</p>
 <p>He shook his head and stopped thinking. One million of experience points would require about one and half years. He should just concoct this Aroma Concentrating Pill first.</p>
 <p>He started concocting as soon as he prepared all the ingredients. It unexpectedly went without a hitch. It wasn’t time-consuming because he could get twenty pills in a batch! Each pill was only the size of a grape.</p>
 <p>He was already pretty exhausted by now so he immediately swallowed one pill before shutting his eyes as he quickly drifted into dreamland. If there was someone around him, that person would definitely be able to sense the circulating qi in Qing Shui’s body.</p>
 <p>He slept like he did as usual, and woke up just six hours later without anyone bothering him. If he woke up in the middle and wanted to fall back asleep, he could go back to sleep any time. As expected of an Aroma Concentration Pill.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui woke up, not only had every trace of his fatigue had disappeared, he also felt fully rested and was at his tiptop condition. With this, he could conclude that this Aroma Concentration Pill was actually pretty heaven-defying.</p>
 <p>From now on he had one more type of medicine to concoct. He not only have to concoct the Spirit Concentrating Pills, but also the Aroma Concentration Pills now. Then he’d spend the remaining time cultivating and refining demons.</p>
 <p>By the time he exited the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, he had already concocted two thousand Aroma Concentration Pills. Over this period of time, he had consumed about twenty of them!</p>
 <p>Within a blink of the eye, it was already Qing Zun and Qing Yin’s full moon. They had to arrange for another banquet on that day again and invite some entertainers to perform. This was the World of the Nine Continent’s tradition; to celebrate in a lively and merry way so that the child would grow up into a fine adult.</p>
 <p>TL Note: Full Moon is a joyous occasion that is celebrated in the Chinese tradition when baby turned one month old.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui divided the two thousand Aroma Concentration Pills that he had concocted equally as gifts to the cultivators of the Qing Clan and the few ladies, including Di Chen and Yiye Jiange. The Aroma Concentration Pill and the Spirit Concentrating Pill were almost a perfect match made in heaven. Consuming the Aroma Concentration Pill at night could not only raise cultivation, but also enable one to cultivate at tiptop condition on the next day.</p>
 <p>The Full Moon Feast was a very important occasion for the children, so the Qing Clan had already started their preparation three days prior to the event. They were planning to make it a little more grand if conditions permitted them to.</p>
 <p>They had invited a lot of guests and the feast would be held at the current Qing Residence. The front yard was vast enough and had many exquisite stone tables that were left by the previous Hai Clan. They were enough to accommodate more than six hundred people.</p>
 <p>There was a stage at the other side of the yard, which could also be considered a small sized arena. Martial arts prevailed in the World of Nine Continents, so it was common for friendly duels to happen during banquets.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do you dislike Zun’er? I realized that you rarely hold him but you are holding Yin’er most of the time,” Canghai Mingyue questioned Qing Shui while holding her son in her arms.</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about? I’m only holding Yin’er because I see that you are always playing with him. Mingyue, do you dislike Yin’er?” He looked back at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue jolted. Did he just return the exact question she had just thrown at him back to her? She rolled her eyes at him in annoyance. “Give me Yin’er. You can have this little brat.”</p>
 <p>“Oh sure, so you are switching now because I was right,” Qing Shui muttered under his breath.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue only stared at him speechlessly. But then she bursted into laughter very happily. To be bickering over nothing like this was also a form of happiness. She was only making fun of him earlier.</p>
 <p>Three days passed just like this!</p>
 <p>People started coming when it was late in the morning. Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, Elder Ge and Di Chen had already reached ages ago and were entertaining the important guests from the other sects and aristocratic clans.</p>
 <p>No matter what, the support from some other people was important. The Heavenly Palace alone was not enough to rule the Greencloud Continent. It wasn’t true that the powerful party would always try to swallow the others. Things like that only happened when resources were running out.</p>
 <p>The Alchemist Sect, Qin Clan, the newly sprung up Imperial Beast Sect, Twin Sword Sect, and Cheng Clan… They came one after another, and every one of them was extremely polite.</p>
 <p>Some gorgeously dressed female dancers started their light and graceful dance on the stage nearby. Although there were no special lighting effects, they still looked very beautiful. Those female dancers were also cultivators, a few among them even possessed the strength of a Xiantian.</p>
 <p>These dancers were almost like those celebrities in Qing Shui’s previous world. Their social standings couldn’t be compared to prostitutes. They had been constantly travelling all around the world. It was said that the biggest similar group that travelled around the Nine Continents like them was very powerful.</p>
 <p>Aroma of wine and delicious food filled the air of the Qing Residence. Of course, with the amount of guests in here Qing Shui didn’t serve them with his special ingredients because he didn’t want to attract any unwanted attention. The chefs were all hired from outside and they were all very famous in the Greencloud Continent so the cuisine that they served was extremely scrumptious.</p>
 <p>By the time it was almost noon, there was only about one thousand people left at the Qing Residence. Every single one of them were respected figures in this area. The disciples of some clans and sects were having a friendly duel on the stage. The atmosphere was harmonious and cheerful.</p>
 <p>This was the Qing Residence. No one dared to shed any drop of blood or make things unhappy here. That would mean not giving Qing Shui any face and embarrassing the Qing Clan. If that happened, Qing Shui would definitely not let things slide.</p>
 <p>A reverberating bird’s cry rang out suddenly. It was sharp and piercing to the ears!</p>
 <p>Many people saw a few gigantic birds flying in the sky at a distance. Qing Shui frowned as soon as he spotted them. A familiar scene replayed again as he saw the burly man standing on top of the gigantic bird. He looked bold and powerful, and exuded an aura that could subdue someone.</p>
 <p>The Sky Tyrant Lord!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would never forget about him in his entire life. Within the blink of an eye, four of those gigantic birds arrived with about thirty people. When Di Chen saw them, she looked at Qing Shui with a flash of guilt in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Thirty people slowly landed at the Qing Residence as they followed the lead of the Sky Tyrant Lord. The Sky Tyrant Lord hadn’t changed much over the past few years. He gazed at Qing Shui, before looking at about a thousand of the best cultivators in the Greencloud Continent. He then snorted in disdain. Although he didn’t say anything, anyone could see the contempt in his gaze.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt uncomfortable, but this slight discomfort was nothing compared to the tribulations of life. So he still naturally chose to remain silent.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t expect to see you still alive. Even your children have been born,” the Sky Tyrant Lord looked at Qing Shui and Di Chen who was standing near to him.</p>
