At that moment, Qing Shui was like a tiny boat in the vast ocean with the waves around him attempting to swallow the boat whole at any moment...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent Bull’s Strength Slash!</span></p>

The old man had his mind set on eliminating Qing Shui, otherwise, they would be thrown aside by the young man. Not to mention, this young man had declared his intentions of having the members of the Niu Clan rebuild the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Clan couldn’t afford to lose their pride in this. In addition, their destiny had dictated that they remained adversaries, hence, the best way to go about this was to destroy the root of them all and eliminate the opponent at the bud. The old man knew that if he didn’t kill Qing Shui now, there would only be fewer people who could subdue him in the future. This would be a huge threat to the Demon King’s Inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if it was for the situation that had recently unfolded, he needed to get rid of Qing Shui either way. Thinking this, his attack increased by thrice the vigor. No matter the method, he was bent of killing Qing Shui today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Although it looked as though the tiny boat could capsize at any moment or be submerged in the storm, he escaped danger every time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demonic Ox King!&nbsp;</span></p>

Or rather, it looked similar to an ox but carried an even more domineering presence. It was strong, tall, mighty, domineering, covered by a pelage that looked akin to Fire Scaled Battle Armor. It was more imposing in comparison to Kirins or Fire Lions; it would not be inferior even alongside beasts of the dragon class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the old man's battle beast and his mount—a Demonic Ox King, It was only about fifty meters in size but this could be easily overlooked by the aura it exuded. It was much larger than humans but petite when placed against stronger beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui unleashed his Art of Pursuing and Emperor’s Qi the moment the Demonic Ox King appeared. This beast was tamed by the old man and considering the moment he had chosen to summon in; it appears that not everything would be as it seemed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its roar seemed to tear the sky apart. Qing Shui had never heard such a cry from an ox. It hardly sounded like an ox at all and instead, sounded more like a brutal beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was indeed really worthy of being the successor of the Titan Ox Demon King Inheritance; even the beast he tamed was related to an ox. The old man rushed towards Qing Shui right after summoning the Demonic Ox King. But not before the Demonic Ox King did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui called up the Nine Continents Mountain in haste to block and change its trajectory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Its vigor increased by another 30%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, the old man’s silhouette appeared above Qing Shui, cornering him along with the Demonic Ox King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too late to defend with the Nine Continents Mountain. Qing Shui held his Golden Battle Halberd and abruptly charged towards the Demonic Ox King, exposing his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast and Qing Shui pushed ahead together while his Hell Nightmare Beast lagged behind. The old man rushed towards Qing Shui with his lit baton.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bull King Shift!</span></p>

The Golden Battle Halberd in his hand went straight for the Demonic Ox King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seal of Phoenix!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Battle Halberd shot a golden Phoenix from its tip. With a flash of a movement, it penetrated into the body of Demonic Ox King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seal of Phoenix was the last combat skill that Qing Shui learned of the Phoenix Form. This combat technique doubles the damage inflicted by attacks, locks its target and interferes with the soul. After its success, it would cause its target to lose focus for an indefinite amount of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At its worst, it was still able to cause disturbance to the soul and act as a distraction—just like diverting attention. Such situation could prove to be dangerous in battle and would even be fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ungh!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sharp cry sounded upon the tackle. Suddenly, the Demonic Ox King seemed to have fallen into a strange state, acting as though it had forgotten about the battle at hand. Qing Shui saw the struggle in its eyes. At this moment, the Dragon Slaying Beast seized the opportunity and lunged towards their opponent, piercing through its pair of huge eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the lit baton behind him smashed against Qing Shui. In the midst of the reddened sky, there was a streak of golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Paragon Golden Armor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a cannonball, Qing Shui's body was shot aside but his body didn’t sustain any damage. The streak of golden light had likewise healed his previous injuries. He turned to watch the struggling Demonic Ox King, a glint of compassion flickered in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that the Demonic Ox King had to die. If it didn’t, he would surely be the one to suffer instead. It was why one couldn’t be soft-hearted at times; those who were soft-hearted would most likely be at a disadvantage. The Dragon Slaying Beast invaded the brain of the Demonic Ox King. Even if the Demonic Ox King had an exceptional ability, it could only await destruction in resignation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the first time, the old man's face was filled with sadness and anger. This was the second life of a Beast Tamer; the powerful Demonic Ox King had followed the old man for two thousand years. This time, it died before it had even utilized its full strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart ached. In his previous life, he had grown upset by the death of a pet dog which he had raised for a couple of years. For the Demonic Ox King to be with the old man for two thousand years, it must have been considered as kin to the latter; perhaps it had an even closer relationship compared to the younger generation of his family. The kinship had long thinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui exhaled a sigh of relief after killing the Demonic Ox King, but he still couldn’t let his guard down. He wanted to dawdle; as long as he could drag this out, he would be able to attain victory without question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to drag it out but the old man had different plans. The fire baton-like weapon in his hand was gone. It was instead replaced by a thick spike, as well as a pair of enormous golden scissors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui felt the keen murderous intention from above, the old man had already rushed towards the Hell Nightmare Beast. The spike in his hands pierced with ease into the Hell Nightmare Beast's body.</span></p>

The pair of scissors in his hand penetrated as well and at the point of contact, a horrifying sound reverberated. The skin of the Hell Nightmare Beast was torn open, leaving Qing Shui astonished. In his fear, he rushed towards the old man with the Dragon Slaying Beast in tow.</span></p>

At the same time, Qing Shui summoned the Thunderous Beast. Now, Qing Shui realized just how many great weapons the old freak had up his sleeves. It was terrifying to witness the spike; it must be a Divine Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Qing Shui had the Thunderous Beast sacrifice a Violet Lightning Strike in exchange to send the Hell Nightmare Beast back to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The injury wasn’t critical but if it had dragged on any longer, it would be life-threatening. The old man would definitely destroy the Hell Nightmare Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had always thought that the Hell Nightmare Beast's current strength could definitely overcome those below the Divine stage, and it might still have been able to. Unfortunately, there were magical treasures such as the scissors and the spike on this Earth. It was rumored to be made of the legendary Divine Stone of Five Elements Metal, forged by real Phoenix blood. The level of incision was horrifying beyond compare.</span></p>

Even with the old man’s golden scissors, the Dragon Slaying Beast couldn't be pierced through easily. It was a metamorphosis from a treasure beast, and inherited this ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched as the old man lunged towards him with the pair of scissors and spike and froze momentarily. With his subconscious, he controlled Nine Continents Mountain as his defense and held out the Gold Needles before dipping them into his own body.</span></p>

An oversight could mean the end of a life. Fortunately, the speed of the old man had been reduced greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood flow in his body was streaming faster. Qing Shui could feel his strength getting stronger than ever before. He clenched the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand as he lunged towards the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clink, clink!</span></p>

Occasionally Qing Shui could land a hit or two upon the old man and his position each time remained unique, but it wasn’t deadly nor did it land on an acupoint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meridians Tapping!</span></p>

He had thought that Qing Shui was only hitting him in all the other places because he didn’t have the ability to hit him where it would threaten his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already paralyzed the other before, so the old man wasn’t surprised. Deep in his heart though, he knew that he had to be wary. An accidental stumble would make this his doomsday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After once, then twice, Qing Shui slowly gathered his own vital energy. During this time, Qing Shui had also been beaten up to the point of sustaining internal injuries, but he could still hold on. Even if he had been injured, it was fortunately not fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere below was a deadly stillness. This battle had surpassed everyone's expectations. Qin Qing watched on intently and nervously. Each time Qing Shui got a beating or incurred injury by the other's weapon, her heart ached. She was worried that the very scenario she dreaded would unfold before her eyes...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere within the Imperial Cuisine Hall was tense as well. The same applied for the Niu Clan; even Lei Ming had calmed down. With such a battle between Qing Shui and the Niu Clan’s ancestor, his loss wasn’t unjust either. He was caught in a dilemma—as much as he wanted the Niu Clan ancestor to win, he didn’t want them to beat Qing Shui that easily. Regardless, his heart seemed to have a sensation of revival.</span></p>

The old man's spike pierced through Qing Shui’s left shoulder and the severe pain caused Qing Shui's eyebrows to squeeze together.</span></p>

Qin Qing's eyes glistened, her hands clasped tightly together without her realizing it, and she stepped forward before she could stop herself.</span></p>

The sharp spike in his hands aimed towards Qing Shui’s heart.</span></p>

There was a slight movement in his stature before he retreated back a distance, evading out of his opponent's range of attack. On the other hand, the old man suddenly realized that his body was spasming out of his own control, his limbs grew stiff suddenly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meridians Tapping!</span></p>

As the old man fell into a trance, Qing Shui’s body emitted a stream of light and the old man watched as it entered his forehead. A searing pain started from the point of contact. Reaching out his hand stiffly, he felt the small hole in his head, followed by an unbearable pain in his mind, as though his brain was being torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man could no longer maintain his calm composure; his hands gripped his head.</span></p>

He felt as though he was dying, but he was still indignant. It was almost dazzling when he looked at the young man in front of him, with critical wounds littering his body, drenched in blood.</span></p>
