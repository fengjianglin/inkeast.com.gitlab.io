 <p><strong>AST 885 - Early Martial Emperor Five-Headed Demonic Spider, Qing Shui multiplying his earnings</strong></p>
 <p>The huge body of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider had not grown larger. In fact, it seemed to have shrunk slightly. Nonetheless, it gave off a feeling that it had become more ‘tempered’ and its shriek became even louder.</p>
 <p>The silverish-grey glow from the Five-Headed Demonic Spider grew brighter and brighter. Its huge body trembled continuously. It started to shed its shell, which was as hard a steel. It was growing a new layer.</p>
 <p>Rebirth?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his wish might be fulfilled soon. If the Five-Headed Demonic Spider could break through to Martial Emperor, even if it was the weakest of Martial Emperors, it would be sufficient.</p>
 <p>The silverish-grey glow grew brighter and brighter and the Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s aura grew stronger and stronger. Qing Shui stood in the distance and watched, waiting for the Five-Headed Demonic Spider to evolve.</p>
 <p>The time it took for one incense stick to burn passed. Suddenly, the body of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider seemed to have exploded. The silverish-grey glow became extremely resplendent. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider released an intense aura and was wrapped up in that glow.</p>
 <p>This time, it did not take long. Soon, the glow rescinded. Qing Shui stared blankly at the Five-Headed Demonic Spider in front of him. It was a pure silverish-grey and it looked very beautiful. Its body had a metallic look to it. However, it seemed to be half as large as before….</p>
 <p>However, its abilities had undoubtedly grown a lot stronger and its thick aura was incomparably intense…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the current Five-Headed Demonic Spider should be comparable to that Golden Dragon. The eyes on the five huge heads turned silvery-grey. It looked a lot more natural on it.</p>
 <p>When it saw Qing Shui, it actually made ‘chichi’ sound and ran over. Then it ran circles around Qing Shui. Maybe because it had become his demonic beast but Qing Shui could feel that it had a strange connection with him.</p>
 <p>He could even feel a sort of dependence that the Five-Headed Demonic Spider had towards him. It was an indescribable feeling. It was as though the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was a small child……</p>
 <p>This feeling made Qing Shui feel like laughing. It was an indescribable feeling. He stretched his hands out to touch this huge fellow, trying to sense its abilities. He was actually unable to tell……</p>
 <p>However, now that it had become his demonic beast, Qing Shui was able to use his Heavenly Vision Technique to look at the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. He wanted to see what strong techniques it had, so that he would be able to utilize it better in the future.</p>
 <p>Mutated Five-Headed Demonic Spider!</p>
 <p>This was the first thing Qing Shui saw. He felt amazed for awhile before he became happy. The probability of demonic beasts mutating was very low. When it happened, it was normally a good thing. It would gain some special abilities or techniques, allowing its abilities to become stronger.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the size of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, Qing Shui felt that it should be a result of the mutation. He then went to take a look at the techniques of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>Five Qi Origin: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s innate technique. Permanently raises the body’s abilities by five times. Does not consume any energy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He original felt that having the Fire Bird and himself was enough. Only now did he realize that the gap between a peak Martial Saint and an early Martial Emperor was so wide.He was sure that the abilities of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider were definitely at the level of a Martial Emperor. It might even be a high early Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider attacks with an inescapable web. The web has a cohesive and corrosive property. The resilient spider silk is difficult to cut even with a blade.</p>
 <p>Poison Silk Entanglement: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider can fire a thread of poison silk. This attack has a range of 500 meters and entangles the target. Its speed is very fast and it is highly toxic and cohesive.</p>
 <p>Spider Swarm Attack: The unique ability of a king of demonic beasts. Its strong subjects are able to attack together with it.</p>
 <p>Flying Spider Silk: After using this ability, its speed will increase by five times. This ability lasts for seven and a half minutes. It can be used once a day.</p>
 <p>Sharpness: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s eight legs are incredibly sharp. They carry a high toxicity and penetrating ability.</p>
 <p>Unyielding Shield: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s defense is extremely strong.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly looked through the techniques in one breath. This Five-Headed Demonic Spider did not have many battle techniques, nor did it have an explosive ability like the Mighty Elephant Stomp or Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness.</p>
 <p>Although this Five-Headed Demonic Spider did not have that kind of explosive battle techniques, nor did it have a technique like the Fire Bird’s Hell's Inferno, it was good at sneak attacks and crowd control. It could suddenly increase its speed and use the Corrosive Poison Web or Poison Silk Entanglement. Qing Shui was thinking that he could combine the Thunderous Beast’s Violet Lightning Strike with the Corrosive Poison Web or Poison Silk Entanglement…</p>
 <p>The Flying Spider Silk was a skill that it had obtained after it mutated. The Corrosive Poison Web and Poison Silk Entanglement should have been strengthened as well. He was now satisfied. He had never expected that after mutating, it would warm up to him so much. He initially thought that this early Martial Emperor beast would not be as close to him as his other demonic beasts. However, things turned out different to what he had expected.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui attempted to communicate with it but after he heard its voice, he became stunned…</p>
 <p>That old turtle that guarded the water crystal palace back then had an aged voice. It was a voice that was transmitted through his consciousness. However, the voice he heard from the Five-Headed Demonic Spider now was that of a four or five year old girl…...</p>
 <p>Was it because that old turtle was a very strong Martial Emperor or was it because it was very old……? As for this Five-Headed Demonic Spider, it was only in its early stages…...</p>
 <p>This was only Qing Shui’s guess. He supposed that the ability to communicate via the consciousness was a standard of determining if a demonic beast was a Martial Emperor. Only by becoming a Martial Emperor could a demonic beast communicate with its master via an illusionary voice.</p>
 <p>His Five-Headed Demonic Spider was now a Martial Emperor leveled demonic beast. His wish had finally been fulfilled. Qing Shui was feeling very happy now. As he put away the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, he communicated with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>The results caused Qing Shui to become very astonished. When the Five-Headed Demonic Spider broke through to Martial Emperor, everything it sensed and saw was new to it. It could be said that the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was now a clean slate but it was roughly aware of its master and some situations.</p>
 <p>This lead Qing Shui to be incomparably happy. To think that this would happen. It looked like that when demonic beasts broke through to Martial Emperor, it was similar to a rebirth. To Qing Shui, this was a good thing. When this happened to a tamed demonic beast, it would not forget its master. Just like Qing Shui’s demonic beast, the brand on their souls would not vanish. Furthermore, after they broke through, they would remain by the side of their tamer. It would not become a masterless demonic beast after being reborn.</p>
 <p>This was Qing Shui’s guess. Qing Shui had read some records on Beast Tamers in history books. These records said that the tamed demonic beast would not betray its master when it broke through. Only when the beast was mistreated to a certain extent would it have thoughts of betrayal. There were very few people who would mistreat their demonic beast. Aside from some perverted people, no one would choose to do that. For tamers, their demonic beasts were akin to their children.</p>
 <p>After experience rebirth, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was now very different from before. After taking this step, it was like it had ascended to the heavens. Qing Shui really wanted to know about the level of its abilities. So he asked the Five-Headed Demonic Spider about its abilities. The answer he got caused Qing Shui to be very astonished.</p>
 <p>Under its peak state, its abilities would nearly reach 400 stars...</p>
 <p>This was a difference of a hundred stars compared to before. After all, previously it was already half a step into the Martial Emperor realm. Now, the level of its abilities directly jumped to 400 stars…...</p>
 <p>After all, just the Five Qi Origin could increase its body’s ability level by five times. The body of demonic beasts were naturally strong and they had innate battle techniques. Humans, on the other hand, had other supplementary techniques.</p>
 <p>The earlier increase of 100 stars was actually just an increase of 20 stars. After he weakened it, it should still have about 50 stars of abilities. Although it was strong, its speed was truly lacking.</p>
 <p>This was the reason why Qing Shui was happy. It looked like he had gained a lot. With this breakthrough, its strength had multiplied, how terrifying.</p>
 <p>The starting point of demonic beasts was very high and was unlike humans, who could multiply their level of abilities by ten with every breakthrough. Humans had weapons and their other supplementary techniques. They had to use their brains but demonic beasts could rely on their bodies. This was how it had been since time immemorial.</p>
 <p>Seeing the abilities of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider caused Qing Shui to be very excited. This could also be considered as a huge increase in his strength. Although he had not become a Martial Emperor, he now had a Martial Emperor leveled demonic beast……</p>
 <p>He had not come to the Sky Penetrating Mountains for nothing. The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was very strong, which made his trip to the Southern Viewing Continent very worth it. The Thunderous Beast had also made significant contributions……</p>
 <p>Not long after this, a large group of demonic spiders came. These were the subjects of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. There were about 500 of them. Qing Shui informed the Five-Headed Demonic Spider of the rules of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was now very big, it would have no problem accommodating all these spiders. He was just worried that the spiders might wreck the things in there.</p>
 <p>Thus, Qing Shui communicated with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. After obtaining its guarantee, he sent all the spiders inside his realm. The things that they could eat were the black fishes, turtles, and prawns. Qing Shui even made another huge pond and placed some black fishes, turtles, and prawns in it for them. With their speed of proliferation, food for them would not be a problem.</p>
 <p>The Jade Spirit Fruit Tree that he placed in there not long ago was somewhat close. He also placed in the jade stones he obtained from the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp along with some rare herbs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui brought all of the spiders in together.</p>
 <p>After observing them for awhile, there did not seem to be any problems. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider now had a greater ability to make the other spiders submit to it. Out of the 500 spiders, there were 30 Four-Headed Demonic Spiders. These were Martial Saint leveled demonic beasts. A few of them even had ten stars of abilities.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui truly felt this was a great gain now. He felt that he would not have any problem within 300,000 li of Sky Penetrating Mountains. Even if he pushed further by 200,000 li, there would still be no problems. He could finally focus on looking for the Sky Penetrating Grass.</p>
 <p>When he communicated with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, Qing Shui found out that its old nest was nearby. There seemed to be some things in there. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider then took the lead and brought Qing Shui back to the old nest. The five hundred spiders stayed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, absorbing the Spiritual Qi and cultivating.</p>
 <p>The old nest was only about 100 li away. To them, it was just a moment of traveling. After breaking through to Martial Emperor, Qing Shui found that the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was now very fast.</p>
 <p>At the very least, Qing Shui would not be any faster than it even if he tried his best. Its speed was not inferior to that of Golden Jiao. Qing Shui felt that this new-found speed was an additional ability granted by the mutation.</p>
