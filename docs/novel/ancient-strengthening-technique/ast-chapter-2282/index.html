 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, Yehuang Guwu’s body shuddered as she hugged Qing Shui tightly, her meek moans rushing into his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui kissed her body as his hands were roaming, touching, and rubbing those full mounds from behind. Bending her entire body up in pleasure, she began to show off her emerging plump bosom. In that position, with her mature, charming, and picturesque eyes, she shyly peeked at Qing Shui, releasing the fatal allure. She really gave him a calamity-bringing expression, making Qing Shui feel another surge of vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yehuang Guwu began rocking like a boat on the ocean, sometimes high sometimes low as if she were on cloud nine. Her meek moans were resonating dynamically, sometimes high sometimes low as she actively welcomed Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Qing Shui brought her to the climax, he himself reached the pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Shui, I’ve missed you a lot!” Yehuang Guwu was panting, hugging Qing Shui as she kissed him happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was tightly hugging her; her body as weak as mud, completely relying on Qing Shui. The two were still very much glued together, as he kissed those ravishingly wet lips. “Little Wuwu, I’ve missed you too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yehuang Guwu was older than Qing Shui. She was Tantai Xuan’s master, but she loved Qing Shui’s nickname for her. She was a mature, charming, and graceful woman, yet she was like a mistress snuggling up to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yehuang Guwu could have gone to Qing Shui using the Five Elements Divine Flag, but the Qing Clan were his roots, and so were they her roots now, and they had to be protected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She would not let any mishaps happen to this place, lest her life would be filled with regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Making you guard the home, it’s been tough on you. I just can’t trust anyone else to do it,” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not allowed to talk like that, I haven’t suffered at all. I’m very happy as this is my home too, you know?” Yehuang Guwu glared at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, Little Wuwu. I’ll help you wear your clothes.” Qing Shui patted her bosom, sending a shiver down her spine. That jadeite, round bosom was just perfect, making Qing Shui’s upright thing even more excited. It had the power to make Yehuang Guwu completely crumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“En!” Yehuang Guwu didn’t know if she promised to let him put on clothes for her, or whether she was reacting to Qing Shui’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been very long since their last time, so letting Yehuang Guwu enjoy herself made him feel content. Since he was gonna stay for a long while, though he really wanted to do it again, he restrained himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was adept at taking off clothes, but helping others to wear them was too tough. He was only able to help Yehuang Guwu dress up after a while. It was obvious to anyone who had been at her position before that Yehuang Guwu had just enjoyed the greatest pleasure as a woman. Even looking in the mirror, she was slightly embarrassed to see herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Shui, if we go out like this, they’ll laugh at me.” Yehuang Guwu said, obviously very embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s so funny? We will also be doing the same thing tomorrow, and I think you look very pretty.” Qing Shui had also put on his clothes, pulling Yehuang Guwu out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui’s return brought everyone great joy, while Yehuang Guwu’s changes weren’t noticed by many. Qing Shui looked at his ever youthful, ever beautiful mother and run forward to hug her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Yi rubbed his head, ecstatic as she looked at her son. “Brat, you left for so long and didn’t visit us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui chuckled as he put down his mother, pulling her hand, understanding that this was just her pouting. “I missed you guys too much, so I came back from nowhere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then hugged Canghai Mingyue, Mingyue Gelou, Huoyun Liuli, and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui saw the group of children, all of whom had already grown up. Yuchang, Qing Zun, Qing Ming, Qing Yin, Qing Yu, Qing Yan, Qing Long, Qing Yun, Qing Jun, and Yan Lang. Qing Zun’s group had already reached the Martial Emperor state with solid foundations, their strength rising steadily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui hugged Qing Jun and Yuchang, only Luan Luan wasn’t home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Jun was adopted. Now that she had grown up, she was very beautiful but she still couldn’t speak. She could use her navel to speak though, so she could communicate with everyone just fine. She was also aware that she wasn’t related to them by blood, but she was still very happy as everyone here treated her well like their own blood-related family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuchang’s mother Mingyue Gelou was also here. Yuchang was also adopted, and their first meeting was when Qing Shui had saved her life, so she always felt like she was Qing Shui’s daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jun’er, did you miss Daddy?” Qing Shui rubbed her head. She had already grown up, but she was still just a young adult, her face still looking fresh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I did!” Qing Jun happily said as she hugged Qing Shui’s neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This joyful reunion took a while before Qing Shui started giving out his gifts. This time, he had a lot of Monkey Wine for them. The wine was good stuff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had wanted them to head to the Sea King’s Palace, but he decided against it since the Qing Clan’s strength was too weak. Just like his mother and grandfather, they would not become powerful, nor would they be willing to leave. They had already grown attached to this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then took out the Golden Martial King Pellets which he had prepared. It would allow his family member to enter the Martial King Stage instantly. This made them ecstatic as he continued to help them get rid of their impurities. Though it wouldn’t increase their cultivation, it would remove some hidden wounds and make their bodies healthier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To Qing Shui, his grandfather and mother’s strengths were not important, it was their health and lifespan that was his main concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Luo was very satisfied; he would usually sit down with some old men and drink some tea and wine, just enjoying his old life happily. He was content with his day as Qing Shui was his most priceless gifts in life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Luo was over a century old, yet he was glowing with a healthy look. It was all due to his revitalized body, allowing him to live up to five hundred years. He felt like he was the most fortunate person ever. He had his sons, daughters, and grandchildren around him while able to look at them growing stronger and stronger, totally transcending his generation. What was there to hate in his life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took out everyone’s blood essence and refined it, binding a Black Ice Divine Worm to them as a Guardian Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Ice Divine Worm was basically enough just to lessen Yehuang Guwu’s burden. These years, she had spent a lot of time and effort. Thus, Qing Shui gave her one as a mount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mingyue Gelou also got one, but the rest didn’t as they were too weak. These two plus the Guardian Beast were sufficient for protecting them, not to mention the Guardian Divinity would strengthen the Black Ice Divine Worm and the restrictions placed would be balanced out by the strength increased. Those that became Guardian Beasts would always receive a massive boost in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Zun and Qing Yin had already grown up, not needing any extra protection anymore. So, Qing Shui wanted to give both Yehuang Guwu and Mingyue Gelou more freedom, such that they could go wherever they wanted. They were also already strong enough to do so. Their protector, Yehuang Guwu basically never left a five hundred meter radius from the Qing Clan.</span></p>
