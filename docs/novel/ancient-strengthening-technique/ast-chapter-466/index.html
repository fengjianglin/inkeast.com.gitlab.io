 <p><strong>Chapter 466 Feng Clan's Expert, Qing Shui's Current Level.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 466 Feng Clan's Expert, Qing Shui's Current Level</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji would never have expected that Qing Shui would have such terrifying progress. They suddenly recalled how his he had suddenly made great progress after he had gone to visit the Old Ancestor. Once they connected to the Old Ancestor, everything seemed to be natural.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hahaha, alright, but Qing Shui, you still have to be careful. When the time comes, we'll root for you. This old man is nothing much, but I still have a few friends who are not bad." Cang Wuya smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. He knew that Old Master Cang had smiled because of his great progress. If Qing Shui was only at this level, he would not have dared to challenge Feng Clan. Therefore, Qing Shui knew that although the Old Master had said that it was alright, he would not let him challenge Feng Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui still had the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. With it, Qing Shui felt that things were much easier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though this heaven-defying mutated beast was still young, it was already a terrifying existence in Greencloud Continent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked forward to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's growth. In his consciousness, he knew that this Diamond Gigantic Elephant could grow up to over 30 meters long, over 10 meters high, in its adult phase, akin to a small mountain. It would be able to soar through the air and dig into the ground. It was an existence which was strong enough to match up to a dragon. It was rumored that dragons and phoenixes existed in the world of the nine continents. They were all legendary existences.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji did not ask much. It was because when the Old Ancestor was involved, they would not ask. However, they were still slightly worried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, amongst those Supreme Elders in Feng Clan, there's one whose level was about 4 countries worth. Are you confident?" Cang Wuya recalled Feng Clan's old fogey, Feng Shamo!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"The powers of 4 countries?" Qing Shui was astonished as well. He had expected Feng Clan's Supreme Elders to be slightly stronger, but to be around 3 countries worth of strength. He had also thought of the possibility that there might be those at Peak Martial King who had 4 countries worth of strength, but eventually dismissed the thought.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was because even the Old Ancestor was only at 5.5 countries level!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's right, he's called Feng Shamo. Although he's no longer Feng Clan's clan head, he holds greater authority that the clan head himself and he is Feng Clan's support. In the whole Heavenly Palace, other than the Old Ancestor, this old fellow is considered one of the strongest Peak Martial Kings. Another thing about him was that he is defensive for those closer to him!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of how Feng Clan's descendents always threw their weight around but no one dared to stand up to them. He also understood why they had said that they were from Feng Clan after they knew who he was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fei Wuji's expression had been very weird and his thoughts were churning very fast. He exchanged a glance with Cang Wuya, as if he wanted to say something but eventually did not.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw the whole scene and he smiled towards Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji, saying, "Old Master, Martial Uncle Fei, there's no need to trouble the Old Ancestor. I can settle this myself. Rest assured. I'll not joke with my life on the line."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya smiled helplessly and then gradually said, "Qing Shui, even if you're now at the level of 4 countries, you still won't be Feng Shamo's opponent despite that you're both at the same level."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya knew of how that old fellow had cultivated for hundreds of years, and was not someone which Qing Shui, who had received a sudden boost in his level, could be a match for. It was just that he was not aware that Qing Shui had the heaven-defying treasure, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old Master, I actually have other things to depend on. Please be assured!" Qing Shui thought of his Diamond Gigantic Elephant. That thing was an existance which was comparable to a battle fortress and its defence could reach up to 8 countries worth. When it performed the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness, it could have an attacking force of 5 countries and even its normal attack could reach up to 4 countries worth. The only thing that Qing Shui was not pleased about was its Mighty Elephant Stomp which was only at the level of 4 countries. The strength given by the Diamond Qi was not considered as part of its physical strength although it was not much different.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui did not know if he should be happy or gloomy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The power of the Diamond Qi was that it could raise Qing Shui's powers by onefold any time. No matter what level Qing Shui's cultivation increased to, it would always be able to increase the attacking force by onefold.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But while it could be used on any technique, it would not increase the strength of his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the long term, this was considered reasonable. Thinking back, Qing Shui felt that this passive technique was the most monstrous of them all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards the others before turning to Qing Shui and said, "Qing Shui, just let us be fully assured. Let us see what it is that's giving you so much confidence."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that they would have to know about it sooner or later. Moreover, these people were considered his kin, thus it was no big deal to let them have a look at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. In addition, not much was known about this creature. Although there was also golden elephants in the world of the nine continents, there were many variations of them of different sizes. Qing Shui's Diamond Gigantic Elephant could possibly give others the impression that this was a half-grown golden elephant. Therefore, they might not attract too much attention. They would only be astonished about its cultivation level.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Then let's head outside. You guys will understand after you've seen it for yourself." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing that everyone had smiled and nodded, Qing Shui led everyone outside. He then called out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone looked in astonishment at this awe-inspiring golden elephant. However, when Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji and even Canghai Mingyue saw it, they appeared as if they had seen something unbelievable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were astonished at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation level. Although they could not sense its true level, they knew that it was very strong. It was an intuition.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Especially for Cang Wuya!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, this is?" Huoyun Liu-Li did not know when Qing Shui had gotten this golden elephant. He did not even bring it out to the arena during the battle with Tan Yang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The other people were puzzled as well. What Huoyun Liu-Li asked was what they were curious to find out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"This is that boar from back then. It's just that it has evolved!" Qing Shui reached out his hand to pat that joyful Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What?! It's that small boar which had already evolved once back on the arena?"Now, it was everyone's turn to be surprised. After all, this was truly unbelievable, or rather, it could be said that Qing Shui's luck was too good.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was not news to hear about demonic beasts evolving, but there were not many people who were able to see it for themselves. Most people only heard it by word of mouth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Demonic beast's evolution and the awakening of their bloodline. The former refers to the demonic beast getting an overall boost in its abilities, attain higher strength and tenacity, raising the rate of growth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The former was a rare sign in this world. It was because all the demonic beasts now came from the bloodline of some strong demonic beasts in the very far past. Awakening of the bloodline would be either partial awakening or complete awakening.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's Fire Bird went through partial awakening. It did not turn into that phoenix which rose from the ashes. Now, the Fire Bird had a stronger portion of its blood from the phoenix as compared to before. This was what partial awakening was.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar's transformation into the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was considered a full awakening. The Diamond Demonic Boar which had changed to be like a calf was considered a partial awakening.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old Master, are you assured now?" Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Yours is considered a Peak Martial King demonic beast, but it doesn't mean that it can fend off the whole Feng Clan. What would you do if over ten Peak Martial King cultivators from Feng Clan step forward?" Cang Wuya looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Haha, Old Master, you can try to hit it once with your full prowess." Qing Shui urged Cang Wuya.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, you must show love to your own demonic beast." Cang Wuya shook his head and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: "..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old Master, this golden elephant's attack is considered the lowest amongst the Peak Martial King demonic beasts. But its forte is its defence. There aren't many in Greencloud Continent which can hurt it in the least." Qing Shui explained patiently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Not many people can hurt it... Does this mean that its resistance is also 4 countries?" Cang Wuya looked at Qing Shui, astonished.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old Master is short by half!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya: "..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Who was Cang Wuya? With this short analysis, he managed to point out the crux of the problem. There was no one who could break through this golden elephant's defences. Moreover, with its attack prowess, there was no worry for them to win through numbers.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With this sorted out, everyone was not worried anymore. At the same time, they also thought to themselves how lucky Qing Shui was. However, since it was someone they were close to, everyone was happier than Qing Shui himself for his strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, your boar has gone through a second evolution. What is with this? Look at my little rabbit... I don't care, you must help me." Huoyun Liu-Li tugged on Qing Shui's arm and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly. This lass has thought too highly of him. However, helping her was no problem. He was still left with 70 Beast Pills. He was just not sure if this little thing could be lucky once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'll give you this. Give it to your rabbit. Whether or not it can evolve will all depend on the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King's luck." Qing Shui chuckled, handing Huoyun Liu-Li all the Beast Pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The other time, he had already given one to Canghai Mingyue. He had also given some to Cang Wuya as well as Fei Wuji even though he had not seen their rides before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I know of this. There's so many? I'll feed them all to my rabbit!" Huoyun Liu-Li said happily when she opened the bottle to find out that it was filled with the Beast Pills she was familiar with.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and nodded. Seeing how happy she was, Qing Shui also felt very warm inside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King had taken the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass. Although it originally was the weakest link in the food chain, it had managed to jump many levels up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King saw the Beast Pills in Huoyun Liu-Li's hands, its eyes were brimming with interest but it did not appear to want to snatch it over. It only kept staring at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"This little thing is getting more and more intelligent!" Qing Shui thought to himself. After all, Huoyun Liu-Li and the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King was not comparable to his Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, do you think it'll evolve after eating these?" Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui hopefully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"There's only a 1% chance!" Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You fool! Can't you just make up a lie?" Huoyun Liu-Li pouted and said angrily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: "..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, I also hope that my rabbit can evolve to be as strong as your golden elephant. Then, three days later, it can also help you in your fight with Feng Clan." Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Clan, her gaze especially gentle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt that his heart was at peace with a hint of sweetness. This feeling was very special, very warm. At this moment, Qing Shui had the feeling of wanting to protect her all his life.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya smiled helplessly and then gradually said, "Qing Shui, even if you're now at the level of 4 countries, you still won't be Feng Shamo's opponent despite that you're both at the same level."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya knew of how that old fellow had cultivated for hundreds of years, and was not someone which Qing Shui, who had received a sudden boost in his level, could be a match for. It was just that he was not aware that Qing Shui had the heaven-defying treasure, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Master, I actually have other things to depend on. Please be assured!" Qing Shui thought of his Diamond Gigantic Elephant. That thing was an existance which was comparable to a battle fortress and its defence could reach up to 8 countries worth. When it performed the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness, it could have an attacking force of 5 countries and even its normal attack could reach up to 4 countries worth. The only thing that Qing Shui was not pleased about was its Mighty Elephant Stomp which was only at the level of 4 countries. The strength given by the Diamond Qi was not considered as part of its physical strength although it was not much different.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui did not know if he should be happy or gloomy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The power of the Diamond Qi was that it could raise Qing Shui's powers by onefold any time. No matter what level Qing Shui's cultivation increased to, it would always be able to increase the attacking force by onefold.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But while it could be used on any technique, it would not increase the strength of his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the long term, this was considered reasonable. Thinking back, Qing Shui felt that this passive technique was the most monstrous of them all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards the others before turning to Qing Shui and said, "Qing Shui, just let us be fully assured. Let us see what it is that's giving you so much confidence."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that they would have to know about it sooner or later. Moreover, these people were considered his kin, thus it was no big deal to let them have a look at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. In addition, not much was known about this creature. Although there was also golden elephants in the world of the nine continents, there were many variations of them of different sizes. Qing Shui's Diamond Gigantic Elephant could possibly give others the impression that this was a half-grown golden elephant. Therefore, they might not attract too much attention. They would only be astonished about its cultivation level.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Then let's head outside. You guys will understand after you've seen it for yourself." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing that everyone had smiled and nodded, Qing Shui led everyone outside. He then called out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone looked in astonishment at this awe-inspiring golden elephant. However, when Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji and even Canghai Mingyue saw it, they appeared as if they had seen something unbelievable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were astonished at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation level. Although they could not sense its true level, they knew that it was very strong. It was an intuition.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Especially for Cang Wuya!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, this is?" Huoyun Liu-Li did not know when Qing Shui had gotten this golden elephant. He did not even bring it out to the arena during the battle with Tan Yang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The other people were puzzled as well. What Huoyun Liu-Li asked was what they were curious to find out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"This is that boar from back then. It's just that it has evolved!" Qing Shui reached out his hand to pat that joyful Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What?! It's that small boar which had already evolved once back on the arena?"Now, it was everyone's turn to be surprised. After all, this was truly unbelievable, or rather, it could be said that Qing Shui's luck was too good.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was not news to hear about demonic beasts evolving, but there were not many people who were able to see it for themselves. Most people only heard it by word of mouth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Demonic beast's evolution and the awakening of their bloodline. The former refers to the demonic beast getting an overall boost in its abilities, attain higher strength and tenacity, raising the rate of growth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The former was a rare sign in this world. It was because all the demonic beasts now came from the bloodline of some strong demonic beasts in the very far past. Awakening of the bloodline would be either partial awakening or complete awakening.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's Fire Bird went through partial awakening. It did not turn into that phoenix which rose from the ashes. Now, the Fire Bird had a stronger portion of its blood from the phoenix as compared to before. This was what partial awakening was.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar's transformation into the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was considered a full awakening. The Diamond Demonic Boar which had changed to be like a calf was considered a partial awakening.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Master, are you assured now?" Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Yours is considered a Peak Martial King demonic beast, but it doesn't mean that it can fend off the whole Feng Clan. What would you do if over ten Peak Martial King cultivators from Feng Clan step forward?" Cang Wuya looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Haha, Old Master, you can try to hit it once with your full prowess." Qing Shui urged Cang Wuya.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, you must show love to your own demonic beast." Cang Wuya shook his head and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: "..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Master, this golden elephant's attack is considered the lowest amongst the Peak Martial King demonic beasts. But its forte is its defence. There aren't many in Greencloud Continent which can hurt it in the least." Qing Shui explained patiently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Not many people can hurt it... Does this mean that its resistance is also 4 countries?" Cang Wuya looked at Qing Shui, astonished.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Master is short by half!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya: "..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Who was Cang Wuya? With this short analysis, he managed to point out the crux of the problem. There was no one who could break through this golden elephant's defences. Moreover, with its attack prowess, there was no worry for them to win through numbers.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With this sorted out, everyone was not worried anymore. At the same time, they also thought to themselves how lucky Qing Shui was. However, since it was someone they were close to, everyone was happier than Qing Shui himself for his strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, your boar has gone through a second evolution. What is with this? Look at my little rabbit... I don't care, you must help me." Huoyun Liu-Li tugged on Qing Shui's arm and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly. This lass has thought too highly of him. However, helping her was no problem. He was still left with 70 Beast Pills. He was just not sure if this little thing could be lucky once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'll give you this. Give it to your rabbit. Whether or not it can evolve will all depend on the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King's luck." Qing Shui chuckled, handing Huoyun Liu-Li all the Beast Pills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The other time, he had already given one to Canghai Mingyue. He had also given some to Cang Wuya as well as Fei Wuji even though he had not seen their rides before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I know of this. There's so many? I'll feed them all to my rabbit!" Huoyun Liu-Li said happily when she opened the bottle to find out that it was filled with the Beast Pills she was familiar with.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and nodded. Seeing how happy she was, Qing Shui also felt very warm inside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King had taken the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass. Although it originally was the weakest link in the food chain, it had managed to jump many levels up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King saw the Beast Pills in Huoyun Liu-Li's hands, its eyes were brimming with interest but it did not appear to want to snatch it over. It only kept staring at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"This little thing is getting more and more intelligent!" Qing Shui thought to himself. After all, Huoyun Liu-Li and the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King was not comparable to his Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, do you think it'll evolve after eating these?" Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui hopefully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"There's only a 1% chance!" Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You fool! Can't you just make up a lie?" Huoyun Liu-Li pouted and said angrily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: "..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, I also hope that my rabbit can evolve to be as strong as your golden elephant. Then, three days later, it can also help you in your fight with Feng Clan." Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Clan, her gaze especially gentle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt that his heart was at peace with a hint of sweetness. This feeling was very special, very warm. At this moment, Qing Shui had the feeling of wanting to protect her all his life.</p>
