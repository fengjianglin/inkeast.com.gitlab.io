 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan was puzzled for a moment before she shook her head and said, "I don't know."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's go. Why don’t we come back to my place to take a look?" Yu Xixuan smiled and proposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his head, "Let's do so then. We'll go to your place to find out more about it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a little awkward. He didn't really like to visit other people's places, especially if they were clans which were strong. Most people would feel uneasy whenever they go there as most people from great clans would look down on other people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yu Clan was located in the southwest corner of the Azure Rainbow City and was considered a famous clan in the city. It was a great clan that had continued for several generations. The Yu Clan had many assets, including restaurants, medicinal herbs, cloth shops, weapon shops, and trading companies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many people in the Yu Clan. Although there were probably not that many clans which could compare to their size, a great clan wasn’t solely dependent on the number of people they had. Therefore, it didn't matter if there were a lot of people, as long as there were any in the first place. Ordinary people who came from wealthy families would have a greater family size, perhaps over 100 to even 1,000 people in the family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, as one got stronger, their fertility would weaken in return. The same didn't apply for ordinary people since their fertility wouldn't be affected. Moreover, they would have more women, with many of them having several tens of wives. If each wife were to give birth to two children, that would already be over 100 people. Across several generations, it was natural to have a family of over 1,000 people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The assets of a great clan were different from that of ordinary people. Powerful clans would be involved in businesses at a higher level. Their transactions would rarely involve money, as money would be earned and managed by ordinary people in the clan, as well as those people who were associated with the clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With powerful martial prowess as a backing, great clans would be involved in businesses which had higher risks and value.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they weren't that near to the Yu Clan, Qing Shui didn't feel that they were that far off. It didn't take them long to enter the Yu Clan's territory. This area fell under the Yu Clan's influence and they were the ones to call the shots. The Yu Clan managed the security in the area while people would pay them money. It would be like how taxes were collected in Qing Shui's previous life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yu Clan's manor was southward facing and was very large and extravagant. The Yu Clan was also an existence that was like the Immortal Palaces, which were further differentiated by grades and ranks. However, given how even Yu Xixuan had to run away with her abilities, it went to show that the people here were still very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, Yu Xixuan's strength was at 500 million Dao force, but she had also said that she was ranked third amongst the younger generation in the Yu Clan. This made Qing Shui even more astonished. Yu Xixuan was very young, but just in the Yu Clan alone, there were two other younger members who were even stronger than her. How much stronger could they be? The resources of such a great clan were extraordinary and thinking of how there were still the Liu Clan and Yu Clan[1], which should be above the Yu Clan, how much more resources did those two clans had?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had always been a top-notch existence amongst the younger generation. Of course, he still was. Although his attacking prowess was a lot weaker compared to Yu Xixuan at the moment, putting aside the fact that the Nine Continents Mountain's strength was slightly stronger, Qing Shui could easily defeat Yu Xixuan, using just his own physical strength alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui felt that the resources of this great influence which had a long legacy was too great. It could also be said to be too terrifying. There were numerous clans that were stronger than these three clans in the True Nine Continents World. They could be anywhere, but how strong were those influences?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You don't have to be this tense. They were stronger than me, but now, they most likely won't be as strong as I am. It's all thanks to you." Yu Xixuan saw Qing Shui's expression and said, reassuring him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Yu Xixuan's abilities should be at 1.5 billion Dao force. It seemed that the two other younger members in the Yu Clan had only been stronger than her by around one billion Dao force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Yu Xixuan went through the doors, the people from the Yu Clan all knew that she was back. This Young Miss was very well-known in the Yu Clan and many people in the clan viewed her in high regards. However, there were some things which couldn't be avoided. For example, marriage. Getting married to a good family—a clan that could bring about tremendous benefits to their clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Xuan`er's back!" A married lady smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hello 2nd Aunt!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hello 7th Aunt!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at how Yu Xixuan was dealing with everyone with great ease. Many of them were very polite toward Yu Xixuan, giving off a comfortable feeling. However, Qing Shui had also heard from her earlier that there were also quite a number of people in the clan whom she had detested. For example, one of the married ladies from earlier, her 1st Aunt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan's father was the sixth son in the family and the clan's head was the eldest son, Yu Dingshan. That married lady was Yu Dingshan's wife and since Yu Dingshan was the one managing the clan, this woman kept thinking of ways they could make the clan stronger. The marriage talks with the Liu Clan had been decided by this woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan was averse to that married woman, but nonetheless, she still greeted her happily. The more she did this, the more that married woman would feel unhappy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Xuan`er's back!" The person who spoke up was a graceful man who also seemed to be middle-aged. Yu Xixuan bore a resemblance to this man and there was also a beautiful married lady standing next to the man. At one glance, Qing Shui knew that Yu Xixuan was that lady's daughter. They looked too much alike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man beside her was Yu Xixuan's father—Yu Dinghe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father! Mother!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan hugged the man happily and then hugged the married woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lass, you're already so old and yet you aren't afraid that people would make fun of you? Why aren't you introducing your friend?" The married woman said gently, her gaze full of love as she looked at Yu Xixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also looking at the middle-aged married couple and was taken aback. Yu Dinghe was even stronger than the current Yu Xixuan, and the same also went for that married woman. They were a lot stronger than her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What had astonished Qing Shui the most was that the two of them had concealed their abilities well, especially the married woman. If it wasn't because of Qing Shui's extremely strong senses, he wouldn't have been able to tell what her true cultivation level was. Yu Dinghe's cultivation was also hidden well. Although the 1st Aunt, the 2nd Aunt, and the 7th Aunt were also not bad, they weren't as presentable and were only Martial Emperors. This was why Qing Shui was curious about Yu Xixuan's mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"He's a good friend of mine. He’s Qing Shui. We're going to become partners to set up a medical hall cum restaurant. Mother, don't look down on him. His medical skills are very, very strong." Yu Xixuan proudly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dinghe and the married woman were also observing Qing Shui previously. However, Qing Shui was only a False God, and it was also what others would see him as. Although it wasn't bad, it wasn't much in a great clan like this. Every great clan had geniuses and putting them aside, Qing Shui would also be considered a great talent. After all, he had become a False God cultivator at such a young age.</span></p>

In fact, they were stronger than Qing Shui. Therefore, they kept having the feeling that Qing Shui's abilities weren't exactly what they had sensed. It was a very strange feeling, but they trusted in their own senses more.</span></p>

Qing Shui addressed them as such as he could tell that they weren't normal. Qing Shui wasn't intentionally trying to foster a closer relationship with them.</span></p>

Hah! How many have you really met? To think that an immature and inexperienced young man like you would dare to act so arrogantly and speak so blatantly in the Yu Clan." Qing Shui had just finished his words when a voice spoke out in a disdainful tone.</span></p>
