 <p><strong>AST 958 - Panic, Lei Clan's Choice</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned and he smiled, saying, “This is a woman’s nature. If there's any less, it wouldn't be perfect anymore.”</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu quickly turned her head, pushed open the door and walked in. Qing Shui followed after.</p>
 <p>There was a hall and a room inside which should be the bedroom. There was a bathroom and washroom at the other end of the living room and it could be considered a small-scale basic room.</p>
 <p>However, everything here was new. There wasn't much furniture, but there was the scent of a new room. It was probable that no one had stayed here before.</p>
 <p>It was still not too dark outside since it was only late afternoon.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what do you think about this room?” Lady Duanmu smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course it's fine. It's very good.” Qing Shui replied happily before taking a casual look around and heading for the room where the bedroom should be located.</p>
 <p>The bedroom was considered neither big, nor small. There was a bed with thick blankets set up and it was very clean. There was a standing cupboard, a clothes rack, as well as a desk and chair. Everything was made from high quality sandalwood and the room was filled with a rustic fragrance.</p>
 <p>In this area, the people in the World of the Nine Continents knew how to enjoy themselves better and it was quite commonly seen. After all, there was plenty of precious wood around in this world and thus carpentry flourished too. In terms of skills like carpentry to create furniture and stuff, it was more developed in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned and saw Lady Duanmu standing next to him. In such a relatively small room with an extremely soft and comfortable bed with fresh blankets and pillows, a seductive aura gushed out.</p>
 <p>This aura came from Lady Duanmu and she seemed to also have sensed a hint of intimacy in the room. She was about to walk out but the moment she took a step, Qing Shui grabbed her hand.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you...” Lady Duanmu said with a tremble.</p>
 <p>“Your thoughts aren't very healthy. Why are you running when I'm not even thinking about anything? Are you thinking about scenes not suitable for the eyes of children?” Qing Shui looked at the blushing lady teasingly.</p>
 <p>When a lady like herself blushed, it held a greater charm than a young and shy girl. She glared at Qing Shui, “You're the one with the unhealthy thoughts. You're the one whose thoughts are running wild.”</p>
 <p>“Right, right, I'm the one whose thoughts are running wild. I shouldn't be thinking about you. But when I look at this bed and then see such a great beauty next to me, can't I even think about it even though I can't do anything?” Qing Shui looked at Lady Duanmu, looked at her beautiful flushed red back, her dark and dense eyelashes fluttering like fans and trembling softly.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui...” When Lady Duanmu heard Qing Shui's words, she called out to him angrily. She knew that Qing Shui was teasing her.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, I'll stop.” Qing Shui didn't let go of her hand, but instead grabbed it tightly. He could sense her palpitating heartbeat. It had been a long time since the last time they had been together. For a woman like her, it was as if this was an extramarital affair.</p>
 <p>Her husband was long dead and with her gifts, she should long be remarried, but she had refused to do so. Qing Shui didn't know the reason why. This should be the shackles which the World of the Nine Continents had placed on her. It was very hard for a woman with a traditional mindset to get rid of those shackles.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui wanted to work hard to help her jump out of the cage she was in. He wanted to let her be happy. Right now, even Duanmu Lingshuang shouldn't be against her remarrying. After all, there was still a very long life ahead of her and being alone like this was a very painful thing.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, let go of me!” She looked at Qing Shui who had only grabbed her hand and didn't do anything improper and said, heaving a sigh of relief in her heart. If he were to force himself on here, there was no way that she could resist. She couldn't shout out for help either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't do anything. He knew what the situation was too. If he were to force himself on her, she would definitely disappear and he might never find her again.</p>
 <p>He knew that right now, he was at least her best friend, the only person she could rely on. Therefore, Qing Shui was planning to slowly break through her shackles, letting her be truly free.</p>
 <p>He shamelessly grabbed her hand for a while more before letting go under her furious gaze. Lady Duanmu, upon seeing his smile, also showed a hint of a warm smile.</p>
 <p>After finding Qing Shui a room, the two of them walked out. People were just starting to prepare dinner and the sun had completely set, leaving just a hint of lingering light. It would still take a while before it turned completely dark.</p>
 <p>About one-third of the people from Duanmu Clan had left and even a few branches from Duanmu Clan's main family had left. They were very fast, using a few beast carriages, rumbling as they left.</p>
 <p>Toward all this, Lady Duanmu was as if she had neither seen, nor heard anything. She just let them decide if they were to leave or stay. Of course, Qing Shui didn't feel anything about their departure either. They were the ones to make their own decisions and they could blame no one. People without any persistence tended to be the ones who would miss out on opportunities the most.</p>
 <p>Time passed little by little and no one came to look for Lady Duanmu. Those who should leave had already left and the others had either chosen to remain behind or were unable to leave.</p>
 <p>It had yet to turn dark, but the light stones had started to light up. It was very bright both in the Duanmu Clan and along the streets outside. There were many people outside Duanmu Clan and the restaurants across the street from the Duanmu Clan were all filled with people.</p>
 <p>After all, it was very boring to be standing outside, so they filled up the restaurants and inns nearby. There were also people before the clothing shops and roadside stalls. Everyone was waiting for something.</p>
 <p>The Lei Clan was not too far away from the Duanmu Clan and they would definitely arrive today. There was no difference whether they were to come at night or in the day, since Duanmu City was a city with a great nightlife and with the moon hanging in the west, the sky was very bright tonight.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui looked into the far distance where there were tens of black spots.</p>
 <p>“They're here!” Qing Shui looked toward the distance.</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu didn't say anything, but she was also looking into the distance. This trial concerned the life and death of the Duanmu Clan and if they could get past this, their future would be very bright. It would all be because of this man next to her.</p>
 <p>The Duanmu Clan was also rapidly developing. The reason she could manage the Duanmu Clan was that there were still people who supported her. All these people were the blood siblings, nephews and other relatives of Lady Duanmu's past husband.</p>
 <p>Very soon, the people from the Duanmu Clan all came out. They looked at Lady Duanmu and Qing Shui who were a distance away. Some of them were talking secretly amongst themselves, but they couldn't hide the worry in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang carried her child and was with some other people together with Hu Yanlin. Qing Shui waved his hand and called out the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable before he nodded to Duanmu Lingshuang.</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable ran near to Duanmu Lingshuang. When Lady Duanmu saw Qing Shui's actions, she broke into a faint smile. Seeing Qing Shui's confident look, she also gradually relaxed.</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, he called out the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>“Madam, let's go take a look!”</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu stood on the Fire Bird, while Qing Shui walked with his hands behind his back. Each step he took, it was as if he had just appeared in front with a flash. The Fire Bird's speed wasn't fast and Qing Shui appeared to be very leisurely too. However, to outsiders, they still seemed to be very fast.</p>
 <p>Many people from the Duanmu Clan also went onto their rides and flew into the air, while some others stayed on the ground. The buildings in the area were very far apart and since Qing Shui and the others were very high up, everyone on the ground could see them clearly.</p>
 <p>“Look, Lady Duanmu and that young man have headed over.”</p>
 <p>The moment Qing Shui and Lady Duanmu went into the air, astonished cries could be heard.</p>
 <p>“Do you think that the Lei Clan will apologize to the Duanmu Clan?” Someone asked.</p>
 <p>“With the group that they've brought, do you think that they look like they're here to apologize?”</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Lady Duanmu came to a stop after proceeding forth for less than 500 meters. They then looked at the people from the Lei Clan who were getting closer.</p>
 <p>Snow Eagle！</p>
 <p>There were over 20 Snow Eagles, with only two to three people on each of them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could see them very clearly. There were fifteen old men, probably less than 30 slightly old and middle-aged men and a small group of slightly over ten young men.</p>
 <p>“About 80% of Lei Clan's main fighting force must have come!” Looking at the opponents, Qing Shui thought to himself after sensing their abilities.</p>
 <p>The other party came to a stop 200 meters away. Qing Shui smiled. This distance showed the opponent's abilities. Most people would stand in a spot which was the most advantageous to them and was at the furthest distance they had the greatest confidence to attack from.</p>
 <p>The two huge Snow Eagles in the lead were snow white, with only their eyes and claws in black and all other parts of their bodies were white. They looked very handsome and ferocious.</p>
 <p>There were a total of four old men on the two Snow Eagles. They stood in pairs, next to each other. Only one of them was wearing a set of purple colored clothes while the others were wearing silver rimmed golden clothes.</p>
 <p>“It's that guy!” An old man at the back said to the old man in the lead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could hear very clearly. It was the old man he had crippled one of the arms of in the afternoon. He didn't see the other person and it seemed like he must really have been injured quite badly by the Buddha's True Eyes.</p>
 <p>“You're the one who has harmed a member of our Lei Clan?” The old man in purple clothes looked at Qing Shui, his voice deep and hoarse.</p>
 <p>“You're not strong, but you put on such airs. You still have a chance to admit your mistake.” Qing Shui's voice was very bright and even the people on the ground could hear him clearly. This time around, Qing Shui was also trying to establish authority. Although he didn't kill those people in the day, they were practically crippled.</p>
 <p>“Did I hear wrongly? So many people from the Lei Clan have come. It seems like they're here to butcher the Duanmu Clan to establish their authority. This young man is really daring!” Someone on the ground immediately spoke up in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“The Duanmu Clan is in danger this time!”</p>
 <p>“The Lei Clan is really infuriated. Seems like they aren't planning to let a single one of them go. In Duanmu City, no one dares to humiliate th Lei Clan. This time around, the Lei Clan must be planning to make an example out of them. I wonder if this young man will be able to withstand it?” an old man sighed and said, looking into the far distance.</p>
 <p>“5th Master Song, I heard that this young man managed to cripple a Peak Martial Saint from the Lei Clan in a single move,” a man next to the old man who had just spoken, frowned and said.</p>
 <p>“Any one of those old men from the Lei Clan would be able to do it. After all, those people were only the weakest ones amongst all Peak Martial Saints.” When the old man said this, confidence filled his face, seeming as if he could do the same.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>“Young man, you're talking so shamelessly even though you're on the verge of death. I don't care what relationship you have with the Duanmu Clan but all of you will have to die today.” The old man looked at Qing Shui. They didn't really care about who the Duanmu Clan had gotten help from. For the past two years, they already had a very good idea of how strong the Duanmu Clan was and thus, they weren't worried about Qing Shui at all.</p>
 <p>“You've made this decision yourself, I hope you don't regret it!” Qing Shui looked at the old man coldly and spoke in a cold tone.</p>
 <p>When the old man heard Qing Shui's words, he hesitated for that short moment before waving his hand decisively.</p>
 <p>“Kill! Don't leave a single person from the Duanmu Clan alive!”</p>
