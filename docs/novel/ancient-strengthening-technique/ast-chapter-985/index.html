 <p><strong>AST 985 - She Has Gone To The Other Four Continents, The Abilities of Qing Shui's Demonic Beasts</strong></p>
 <p>She had yet to truly step into the secular world, but was now leaving it...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a very long time before he stared at the old lady, "Senior, do you know where Chen`er went? I'd like to go look for her."</p>
 <p>"If I didn't guess wrong, she will head for the other four continents." The old lady looked at Qing Shui seriously and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old lady in disbelief, "Chen`er have already reached a strength of 5,000 stars?"</p>
 <p>"It's even higher. Chen`er's current abilities is more than sufficient for her to head to the other four continents. However, I'm still a little worried for her." The old lady sighed and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. I'll go look for her as soon as I can." Qing Shui said with great determination.</p>
 <p>"I hope that you can help Chen`er get past this. I should be going!" The old lady lifted her head and said to Qing Shui, smiling.</p>
 <p>"Since senior is already here, why don't you stay for a few days?" Qing Shui quickly said.</p>
 <p>"I still have many things to do. I'll come again if I have the chance to do so in the future! Don't worry, not many people would be able to hurt the current Chen`er. What you need to think about is how to bring her heart back and let her have an attachment to something." The old lady waved and flew off.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to watch until the old lady was gone from his view. Right now, he didn’t have the ability to head for the other four continents yet. It seemed that he would need to get stronger as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>"Bring her heart back and let her have an attachment to something." Qing Shui kept thinking about this line. When one had reached that realm, they would be nonchalant to a lot things. He knew that for Di Chen, it wasn't just being nonchalant and being able to accept a lot of things. It was like how in his previous life, a wealthy man would have no lack of money, but he still considered money as something important. When the amount of money or a certain item reached an extremely high value, he would still be very interested. This wasn't nonchalance, at least, not for Di Chen.</p>
 <p>When one was really nonchalant to things, they would have reached a certain level where even a person's life would be worthless as dirt. Ordinary people would get extremely frightened if they were to kill someone and it might even affect them mentally. However, to a person that treated human lives as useless as dirt, killing others and killing an ant had no difference. Their heart wouldn’t even skip a beat while doing so, this was being nonchalant about life. Similarly, when one felt extremely disheartened, they could take matters involving life and death lightly.</p>
 <p>She had seen through the secular world and was now nonchalant about the things that happened in the human world. Qing Shui now felt very bitter. Di Chen had practically forgotten about him, or rather, she wanted to forget about everything here.</p>
 <p>That was why she wanted to go to the other four continents and have a fresh start. There was no other way around this. If there was a place which she couldn't bear to part with and could hold her back, it would be different. However, it seemed that she had no attachment to anything right now. Otherwise, she wouldn't have left.</p>
 <p>Where was he going to look for her?</p>
 <p>Was he going to wait for her to look for him?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head. He had to deal with the matters that concerned Huoyun Liu-Li and Yiye Jiange within three years first, then he would head towards the other four continents to look for her. He would find her even if he had to comb through the entire world of the nine continents.</p>
 <p>As he returned back to the Qing Clan, many people crowded around him. Qing Shui looked at Di Qing and the others, and then smiled, "You guys must work hard in your cultivation. Chen`er has headed for the other four continents."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui explained some things to them simply, and many of them suffered from a setback. After all, a strength of 5,000 stars was too terrifying for them. However, they also secretly cheered themselves on. It was because they knew that Qing Shui would definitely head to the other four continents. If they weren't strong enough, even if he wanted to bring them along, they wouldn't be able to join him.</p>
 <p>They understood Qing Shui and knew that even if Di Chen wasn't in the other four continents, he would still go there eventually. It was just that he now had an even stronger reason than before to do so. Their progress during this period of time had given them a little hope.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou looked at Qing Shui and secretly thought to herself, "One's lifespan is very long. It can take one year, ten years, or even a hundred years, but I should be able to attain the level to cross the four continents eventually."</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, another two months had passed by. Right now, Qing Shui stared at Zhu Qing in a daze. It was because she had just told him that she was pregnant. Looking at this blissful lady, he smiled.</p>
 <p>He had always hoped that Zhu Qing would be able to have a kid as soon as possible. Qing Shui had known that she always felt uneasy. For people like her who lacked kinship and were lonely, what they needed was something to fill up their hearts.</p>
 <p>The best thing that could accomplish this deed was kinship. Kinship could fill up one's heart. However, since she was already alone, the best method she could choose was to get married, and it would be even better if she could have her own kid.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing took Qing Shui's hand and said with a blissful smile, "Qing Shui, I'm going to have a child too."</p>
 <p>Happiness was something that could be spread and warmth was something that could be passed on to others. When Qing Shui saw how happy Zhu Qing was, he felt very satisfied. This was also a kind of love. Loving what she loved, loving her heart, and loving her smile.</p>
 <p>"That's our child." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing threw a blaming glance at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui coughed dryly before smiling and said, "Do you hope that it'll be a boy or a girl?"</p>
 <p>"I like either, because it's our child."</p>
 <p>Right now, Zhu Qing's charming and beautiful eyes squinted slightly, as if they were a pair of crescent moons. She smiled faintly and exuded a quiet aura.</p>
 <p>She was not an exceptional beauty who could cause the fall of cities and countries. She gave out a very genuine feeling, as if she was really a person right before you. At first glance, one would feel that she was beautiful but it wouldn't make others be in awe. It wouldn't make one fall head over heels for her. However, she had her own unique aura and charm, one would only feel her feminine charms as the time passes.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing would usually study how to cook soup and stuff, or analyze the Nine Palace positionings. She no longer continued to cultivate ever since she had found out that she was pregnant. It should have been fine even if she were to continue with her cultivation but it was better to be safe than sorry. Qing Shui wasn't supportive of her continuing her cultivation either. When a woman's cultivation level increased, it would take them longer before they could get pregnant.</p>
 <p>It was a regulation in the world. As one get stronger, one would face greater restrictions by the world. However, it was still alright. It wasn't as if it would be impossible to get pregnant but only that it need more attempts to become pregnant.</p>
 <p>For the past few days, Qing Shui's physical strength had increased by over two stars. This progress was neither considered slow nor fast. He had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and the matter with Di Chen had also gave him encouragement.</p>
 <p>His cultivation foundation was very strong and his cultivation level was also very powerful. He only needed to accumulate experience and to train more. Within two years, he must increase his strength to 5,000 stars or even higher. Two years to him was much longer than it was to other people. It was 100 times more.</p>
 <p>It was sufficient!</p>
 <p>There were still medicinal pills and the Spirit Gathering Formation. He hoped that within two years, he would be able to refine the "Spiritual Drops". With that, he should able to bring his cultivation to the next level.</p>
 <p>It would be fine even if he couldn’t refine the Spiritual Drops. It should be sufficient for him to rely on his own cultivation. Moreover, he had other resources as well. He could forge the Big Dipper Sword or raise the abilities of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation had also increased rapidly over the past two years or so. It had basically stayed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal all this time. Demonic beasts' cultivation was very simple and time was an important factor. Moreover, there was an ample amount of spiritual Qi in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant which had started off with a strength of three stars was now slightly over 23 stars, an increased of 20 stars in total. At this stage, Qing Shui realized that the improvements of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and the Fire Bird were now faster than before. Could this be the advantage of having high quality demonic beast bloodline?</p>
 <p>He thought that it should be the case. After all, high grade demonic beasts had to grow eventually. If their growth continued to be at such a slow pace, then wouldn't they be killed by low grade demonic beasts? And this was when they hadn't took any powerful spiritual fruits or something similar.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very satisfied with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's progress. He hadn't work on the additional abilities which came attached. There were two lumps of Qi on each side of the Violet Qi Pellet. This lump of Qi had materialized more so than before, but Qing Shui was in no hurry to refine it.</p>
 <p>He wanted to wait a little longer. Once the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation level increased again, he would refine it to let his strength reach 5,000 stars. During this period of time, he would also continue to work hard in his cultivation and strengthen himself. Otherwise, when the time comes for him to refine the additional power which came from the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he would need to take a very long time to get used to them.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant which now had a physical strength of 23 stars had its strength increased in leaps and bounds under the effect of the Dragon Elephant Force!</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Force: Passive battle technique, permanently increases physical strength by three times!</p>
 <p>With that, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's strength was now at 92 stars. Moreover, this was before it had utilized any battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness: Increases random attacks by two times for at least ten targets.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was happy that there was an area attack that was comparable to an early Martial Emperor's attack.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that for the past few years, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had shown no signs of attaining any major breakthroughs, nor did its body go through much changes. Qing Shui didn't care about these either. After all, it was fine as long as his demonic beasts were powerful. In the past, his demonic beasts were stronger than him but after he made a trip to the Sky Penetrating Mountains, he had gained a great lead.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp, a physical attack that was ten times stronger. It was a pity that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's physical strength was still not powerful enough at 23 stars. Even with the Mighty Elephant Stomp, it would only be an attack of 230 stars, slightly stronger than the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird's cultivation had also increased a lot, its physical strength had reached 40 stars. Compared to the four stars it was at before, the increase was tremendous. It was a pity that there were no additional powers or abilities given to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't surprised by the increased of the Fire Bird's speed. It had the bloodline of the Black Phoenix (also known as the Hell's Phoenix), thus no matter how much its cultivation level increased, Qing Shui wouldn't be astonished. He even felt that the rate of its progress was slightly slow. Staying in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for one day was equivalent to 100 days in the outside. However, he was speechless at the thought of the phoenix's lifespan. The Fire Bird should still be considered not to be of age yet.</p>
 <p>Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens: Passive battle technique, zero depletion, permanently increases physical strength by four times.</p>
 <p>All battle techniques performed would have their depletion reduced by half.</p>
 <p>Everytime Qing Shui looked at the Fire Bird's battle techniques, he would feel exceptionally happy. Having his depletion reduced by half was heaven-defying enough. With that, his abilities would reach 200 stars and it had won over the Diamond Gigantic Elephant by a lot. Previously, in order to increase the Fire Bird's speed, Qing Shui had given it many spiritual fruits that would increase one's cultivation.</p>
 <p>Superior Flight: The Fire Bird's unique flying ability, its endurance and speed is unrivalled. It was one of the best across all flying beasts and it allowed the Fire Bird to fly at rapid speed for an extended period of time.</p>
 <p>Hell's Inferno: The powerful flames attack unleashed by the Fire Bird. Its pitch black flames could burn everything and had a terrifying destructive powers. It was said that it was the Black Phoenix's powerful battle technique.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens: When the Fire Bird performs the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens, the damage inflicted by its flames attacks would increase by many folds. It could sustain for 30 minutes and it could be use four times daily. During this period of time, all damages received would be reduced.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird was good in long battles and it had high resistance. Its defence was also quite powerful and its battle techniques were impressive. Right now, under the impact of the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens, the Fire Bird could unleash a damaging powers of 400 stars. Although it wasn't a match to the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, the Fire Bird had a greater room for growth.</p>
