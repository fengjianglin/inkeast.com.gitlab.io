 <p><strong><strong>AST 934 - Benefactor, Seventh Grade of Nature Energy</strong></strong></p>
 <p>“You have grown. You are now more mature. You and Mu Qing are a good match.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yu He who was in front of him. Although her tone was very dull, he could still feel some hidden bitterness in her voice. It was especially clear to him, causing him to not know what to do.</p>
 <p>“Elder Sister Yu, you are more mature than you were before and even prettier,” Qing Shui smiled. After not meeting her for a long time, he had an odd feeling that he was not able to describe.</p>
 <p>“Mature already, is Elder Sister Yu old now? Even I suspect that I am old already,” Yu He drank tea and chatted with Qing Shui casually.</p>
 <p>“How can that be? Elder Sister Yu is an absolute beauty. Every man who sees you will be tempted. I just wonder which man would have that kind of fortune.” Qing Shui looked at Yu He in a regretful manner.</p>
 <p>Women can be scarier than men at times. When he spoke to Mu Qing previously, Qing Shui felt that he had caused her to change. He had never expected that this would happen....</p>
 <p>“Then do you wish to be the fortunate one?” Yu He looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that there were no fluctuations in Yu He’s eyes. Her smile was also very calm, even now, they seemed like good friends joking with each other. However, he knew that she was not joking.</p>
 <p>“I do wish to be that person, but it is not something that I can have just by wanting it. That’s right? Elder Sister Yu, you still have not told me how have you been for the past few years.” Qing Shui laughed out loud and quickly changed the topic.</p>
 <p>He felt that he was too serious earlier. If she pressed further, he would not know what to do. Furthermore, so many years had gone by, people change.</p>
 <p>Yu He naturally could tell what Qing Shui was doing. Even if she wanted to press this topic, now was not the time. Qing Shui had just celebrated his big night. She would not say anything now. Furthermore, it had already been so many years.</p>
 <p>Following that, Yu He told him of the things that happened to Hundred Flowers Valley. Of course there were many details that were skipped past. She had only given him a brief summary. However, she did not hide the fact that Hundred Flowers Valley had footholds in five continents.</p>
 <p>Hearing Yu He’s words, Qing Shui smiled, “Elder Sister Yu met with your benefactor, resulting in a meteoric rise.”</p>
 <p>“In my heart, there is still another important benefactor.” Yu He looked at Qing Shui and laughed loudly.</p>
 <p>“Oh, just meeting one benefactor is sufficient to change one’s life. In that case, congratulations to Elder Sister Yu.” Qing Shui smiled, as he poured more tea for her.</p>
 <p>Yu He smiled and did not say anymore. She knew that Qing Shui understood what she meant. He just did not want to bring up this topic. This caused her to be happy and sad at the same time.</p>
 <p>“What about you? How have you been all these years? Why are you here in Eastern Victory Divine Continent?” Yu He was very curious.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had too many things that happened to him, it was not possible to finish speaking of it within an hour and a half. Yu He actually already knew of many of Qing Shui’s deeds. After all, Qing Shui was very well known in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>When she heard of Qing Shui’s matters, she felt a sour feeling in her heart. He had been struggling alone, unlike herself. In comparison, she had risen to her position very smoothly. Her master was her benefactor. However, without Qing Shui, she would not have been able to wait until her master appeared. Furthermore, it was Qing Shui that had changed her entire life.</p>
 <p>“Are you going to go back soon?” after a long period of time, Yu He looked towards the sky and smiled.</p>
 <p>“It should be somewhere between the day after tomorrow to a week. I have not been home for two years already.” Qing Shui missed his home and wanted to go back as soon as he could.</p>
 <p>“I came here in order to deliver something, I wish to go back too. Shall we go back together?” Yu He smiled at Qing Shui.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, however, what will happen to Silken Web Ridge after you leave?” Qing Shui was puzzled. He was now sure something was going on.</p>
 <p>“Silken Web Ridge already had someone managing it before I came. Furthermore, I am just here to deliver something. This place will still be managed by the original person. The relationship with the Mu Clan will not change, they are good friends of the Mu Clan.” Yu He put on a shallow smile, she seemed to be very happy.</p>
 <p>“Then stay in the Mu Clan for two days. When I leave, I’ll let you know and we can go together.”</p>
 <p>“I still have some things to do. When it is time to leave, I will come and meet up with you.”</p>
 <p>“Alright then, I’ll send you off!”</p>
 <p>“Mn!”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>In the morning, Qing Shui entered into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Even though they were celebrating, they did not stop practicing. Now was a period of high speed growth. They knew that Qing Shui would be leaving soon. Thus, they were working very hard. The problems that they had would be resolved.</p>
 <p>After entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal , Qing Shui started to look into himself. There was a jade-green aura that was pushed into a corner by the Nature Energy. However, it wasn’t able to be dissolved in this short period of time.</p>
 <p>This was just a very small portion that had entered his body. Back then, he had not completely avoided it and some of it had entered his body. It was a good thing that the Nature Energy in his body was strong. It was able to suppress that jade-green aura. That poison aura wanted to enter his Dantian but was forced back by the Emperor's Qi...</p>
 <p>Now, it was nested in a corner. This caused Qing Shui to feel very unsettled. It was like a bomb hidden in his body. He had to force it out as soon as possible. Leaving it in his body would cause Qing Shui to feel very unsettled. It may be fine now but he was afraid that when he was in a battle and was not able to pay attention to it, it might take advantage of the opening and explode out. It might even cause his death.</p>
 <p>Thus, Qing Shui wanted to see what methods he had to force out this poison aura now.</p>
 <p>He sat down cross legged and started to circulate the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Combining it with the Nature Energy, it headed to that jade-green aura. As it pushed it, the speed of circulation increased.</p>
 <p>That jade-green aura seemed to have spirituality. It tried to escape in the meridians. This was a very frightening thing. The meridians were like a spider web, there were many branches to them. If the poison aura escaped, there would be no way to find it in his meridians. He was able to suppress it earlier because the distance and location were at a good spot. After he forced it to a corner near the Dantian, he had not dared to force it too much.</p>
 <p>Now, he circulated his Qi and used a great force to fiercely push on it. The poison aura took advantage and tried to flee. This aura was very mysterious, causing Qing Shui to be extremely frustrated. It was as slippery as a loach, when he managed to dissipate a small amount, it would quickly run away. However, when it was far away, it would not move.</p>
 <p>Dissipating some was still progress. However, the amount that was dissipated caused Qing Shui to feel depressed. At this rate, he would require a very long time. Feeling the slipperiness of this poison aura, Qing Shui was very determined to force it out as soon as he could.</p>
 <p>This carried on for another hour. In this period, he managed to dissipate some of it twice. If only he could catch it anytime he wanted, Qing Shui felt that he would be able to finish this within a day.</p>
 <p>With the current situation, it caused one to be driven mad. However, Qing Shui was prepared. He took out a brocade box filled with Gold Needles that were as thin as cow’s fur.</p>
 <p>Originally, he wanted to test out the strength of his Nature Energy. However, he discovered that the jade-green aura was very strong as well. He could only use the the Gold Needles to assist.</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy was chasing it within his body. Qing Shui was watching the insides of his body. Every time it was in a meridian, he would suddenly jab the needle down, causing the poison aura to be trapped.</p>
 <p>Following behind was the Nature Energy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Gold Needles had blocked up the path of the poison aura, naturally the Nature Energy’s path was blocked as well. Thus, this was only an aid. However, with this method, Qing Shui felt a lot more relaxed.</p>
 <p>Following the passage of time, there was an increasing number of Gold Needles in Qing Shui’s body. The poison aura in his body was getting smaller and smaller. He slowly started to relax. Without this Gold Needles, he did not know how long would it take to completely dissipate this poison aura.</p>
 <p>Very soon, one third of the aura was cleared out. The Nature Energy continued to dissipate the poison aura. Every time it dissipated some of it, there seemed to be some minute changes to the Nature Energy.</p>
 <p>The Sixth Grade Nature Energy was already at the great perfection stage long ago. It had not broken through yet. Qing Shui felt that it was like a tightly wrapped cocoon, there was no way to break through it. However, now, he found that there seemed to be some tears on the cocoon. This caused Qing Shui to be very excited.</p>
 <p>Could the Nature Energy be able to make a breakthrough?</p>
 <p>Although the Nature Energy was not his strongest supplementary technique, it allowed Qing Shui to withstand the pressure that was many times more than Qing Shui’s own abilities. It was able to withstand poison and enticement. Any techniques that walked the path of evil would be suppressed by the Nature Energy. The Seventh Grade of Nature Energy should be a threshold. He felt that the Seventh Grade of Nature Energy would be very strong.</p>
 <p>He originally intended to take a break before continuing. Feeling this miraculous change, he decided to speed up instead. After dissipating some of the escaping poison aura, before Qing Shui could do anything, he discovered that the Nature Energy started twisting in his meridians.</p>
 <p>The swelling of his meridians felt very intense, his inner vision discovered it was moving like a snake, moving at an increasing speed. Qing Shui felt very excited and pulled out all the Golden Needles.</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy in his body grew even stronger and it wound back to the Dantian. Once it returned to the Dantian, the Emperor's Qi circulated automatically for the first time. The two tyrannical Qi clashed against each other.</p>
 <p>The purple Emperor's Qi and the Nature Energy intertwined with each other and circled the Dantian. The speed of the Jindan’s rotation was increasing, spreading the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique outwards.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>In about seven and a half minutes, there was a dull sound. The Emperor's Qi returned to the Dantian and stayed at a spot. In the middle was the golden Jindan. The Qi of the Mental State akin to that of immovable mountains was on the other side. The Nature Energy also occupied a side. They were all revolving around the Jindan.</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy seemed a lot denser than before. It was also much larger. Qing Shui knew that the Nature Energy had broken through.</p>
 <p>Seventh Grade Nature Energy.</p>
 <p>Increase in grade!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still felt like he was a little confused. He activated the Nature Energy and a surging strength arose. It felt much stronger when compared to before its breakthrough. It felt like his spirit was strengthened. There was a strong aura of self confidence.</p>
 <p>The mysterious Nature Energy indeed had some changes at the Seventh Grade, Although it only increased 70% of his abilities, that self confidence, ability to resist poison and pressure had increased by many times. Furthermore, he felt that his ability to resist spirit energy also had a great change.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see where you are going to hide this time!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui activated the Nature Energy and increased the circulation speed of the Nature Energy by many times. He caused it to chase after that jade-green aura. This time, he rushed directly at it, without using the Golden Needles.</p>
