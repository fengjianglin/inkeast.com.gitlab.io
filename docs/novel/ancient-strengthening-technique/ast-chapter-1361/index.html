 <p><strong>AST 1361 - Completion of the Four-Yang Pills. Five Elements Divine Flag Reaching Third Grade</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui prepared some medicinal herbs. He could still remember his failure from before, in the situation where he had been using the Golden Snake Grass. However, at that time, the greater reason was that the medicinal effect of the herbs were insufficient.</p>
 <p>This time around, the medicinal effect was sufficient and he had confidence as well. However, he still felt a little uncertain. He cleaned and tempered the ingredients without any trouble and after taking a short rest, recovering his condition to its best state, he started the alchemy process.</p>
 <p>When the alchemy process started, everything seemed to be more smooth compared to the previous time. However, this time around, Qing Shui realized that the time required would be very long and might even exceed ten times more than was required the last time he attempted it.</p>
 <p>When the sky had turned dark the next day, a clear and crisp sound rang out from the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. It was extremely piercing, representing that his effort in refining for the past two days was a failure.</p>
 <p>Although he had failed, Qing Shui felt very happy. It was because he seemed to have grasped the feeling for it.</p>
 <p>He contemplated for a moment then started again. Time passed by little by little and Qing Shui controlled the primordial flames calmly and with great mastery. Everything seemed to be progressing well.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>On the third day, the familiar sound rang out again. Although Qing Shui knew that the success rate for this attempt wasn't high, he was still a little unhappy when he heard this sound. He had wasted three days.</p>
 <p>After resting for a while and having some food, Qing Shui started once again. He didn't know if he was considered to be obstinate, putting great effort in something insignificant or if he was just unwilling to submit. As he went through consecutive failures, the time used in each attempt was extending slowly. There were times in which it only extended by two hours but there were also times in which it was extended by half a day. Very soon, he had used up the medicinal herbs he had prepared. Left without a choice, Qing Shui could only prepare more. It would be a lie if he were to say that it didn't pain him to have lost so many medicinal herbs, most of which were extremely precious.</p>
 <p>Five days! Six days!</p>
 <p>After continuing to go through multiple failures, this was already the sixth day of Qing Shui's attempts. He gritted his teeth and continued on. If this were to exceed seven days, he would only continue to try until the ninth day at most. If he still continued to fail, he would give up.</p>
 <p>Seven days!</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>After failing for over ten more times, Qing Shui finally heard that familiar sound. It was extremely pleasant to the ears and even Qing Shui felt overjoyed. After all, he had failed multiple times. If he still failed, his time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would be up. Thankfully, it succeeded at the very last moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't wait and opened the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and found a brilliant golden Yang Pill in it. There wasn't much change to its size but its color and spiritual Qi were stronger.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't wait and assessed it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Four-Yang Pill!</p>
 <p>Effect: Improves physique by a large degree. Increases physical strength by one sun or overall strength by 100 sun. Has a reinforcing effect on the Dantian, meridian channels and internal organs.</p>
 <p>Each person can only use one of it every year and only ten in one's life. Doesn't conflict with the One-Yang Pills, Three-Yang Pills and Three-Yang Pills.</p>
 <p>Prerequisites: People who have a strength of 100 sun or more.</p>
 <p>It has some special effects on people with unique physiques. The effects would be related to the individual's physique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put away the Four-Yang Pill. He didn't have the time to use it now since his time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was up. He quickly washed up and headed out.</p>
 <p>It wasn't too late outside and the others had yet to start their dinner. Qing Shui had taken the time into consideration and thus didn't have his meal in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. There was no lack of food in the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, come help me bring out the food." When Yuan Su saw Qing Shui, he smiled and waved.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed her into the kitchen. There were four dishes and one soup, two of the dishes being meat dishes, while the other two were vegetable dishes. There was also a plate of Jade Steamed Buns and a bottle of wine. Qing Shui looked at Yuan Su curiously, "Hmm? What occasion is it today?"</p>
 <p>It wasn't particularly sumptuous but Qing Shui felt that there was something. It was a feeling he had and thus he asked.</p>
 <p>"Today's my birthday. Since you're back, spend my birthday with me. Every year, I'd been spending it alone," Yuan Su smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Stunned, Qing Shui smiled and said, "Happy birthday."</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then took out a pair of Violet Earrings in the shape of the Redbud Flowers. He handed them to Yuan Su, "I haven't prepared anything. I'll give you these."</p>
 <p>"With you back and being able to spend my birthday with me, I'm already very happy. You can help me put them on. It's inconvenient for me since I'm holding onto the dishes." Yuan Su went up and put out her head slightly. She was now less than one foot away from Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Even though there were the fragrances coming from the food, Qing Shui could still smell a faint scent of fragrance. Her tender and flawless face seemed as if it would break at the lightest touch. She had sexy lips and her peaceful and beautiful eyes looked at Qing Shui without blinking.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and gently put her hair back behind her ears, revealing her beautiful earlobes. He then slowly put the pair of Violet Earrings into her beautiful earlobes. The Violet Earrings immediately made her appear more poised. The Redbud Flowers were a very good match for her disposition.</p>
 <p>"How do they look?" Yuan Su looked at Qing Shui and smiled, asking.</p>
 <p>"Very beautiful!" Qing Shui nodded and said.</p>
 <p>"Thank you!" After saying that Yuan Su suddenly landed a peck on Qing Shui's lips and quickly left the kitchen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could still feel that tender feeling from earlier on his lips. That moment happened very quickly and he felt a soft touch on his lips. It was a short touch but yet was one that one would miss.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't think back on the feeling but was wondering what Yuan Su had meant by this. He picked up the remaining two dishes and headed out to the living hall.</p>
 <p>The birthday celebration here was very similar to the one from his previous life. There were no candles here but there were Light Stones. People would make wishes as well, especially ladies. Most guys would skip out on this.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su appeared very natural, as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>She put her palms together and closed her eyes as she made her wish. Her long lashes were very dark and dense. They made her seem extremely attractive as they gently trembled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wouldn't ask what wish Yuan Su had made. At the very least, they weren't in that close a relationship. If she was his woman, he could still ask. "Qing Shui, I have the feeling that you won't be staying here for long." Yuan Su looked at Qing Shui, a little in a daze.</p>
 <p>Her gaze made Qing Shui look away slightly. However, when Qing Shui did so, a hint of loneliness flashed in Yuan Su's eyes. It was very faint but Yuan Su soon went back to how she usually was.</p>
 <p>"I haven't decided on anything yet. I'll probably still wait a little longer and only leave when I attain a breakthrough to the False God."</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was one of the undeniable reasons that Qing Shui could reach his current level so quickly. At the very least, she had helped to save him a lot of time.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su smiled and didn't say anything. She poured a cup of wine for Qing Shui and one for herself as well.</p>
 <p>"Sister Su, come, let's have a toast. I wish that you'll forever remain youthful, beautiful and happy."</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>"Come, have a taste of the food I made. I didn't use any of the spices." Yuan Su picked up some food for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The food was very delicious. Eating was something that revolved around one's emotions and Qing Shui was very hungry as well. He felt that it was very good. To be able to have a meal with a great beauty would unconsciously make the meal much more delicious.</p>
 <p>The meal lasted for three hours and the two of them chatted a lot.</p>
 <p>However, they didn't bring in too much emotion nor did they say anything too intimate. Yuan Su was happy. She really seemed to be very happy.</p>
 <p>"It's late. Sister Su, have an early rest. I hope that you have a good dream." Qing Shui stood up. They were in the living hall in Yuan Su's room. There were some suites on the fifth story and the hall was like the corridors but just different in nature.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su sent Qing Shui out and the moment the door closed, two streams of tears trickled down her cheeks. She hadn't realized when she had started to take a liking to this man in the past year. She was a reserved lady and the kiss she had given him earlier and the act of getting him to help her put on the earrings were sort of a hint to him.</p>
 <p>He doesn't like me...</p>
 <p>In that moment, Yuan Su felt very empty and smiled in self-mockery. She was a confident lady and even when she couldn't cultivate in the past, there would be no end to the number of suitors she had. It was just that she had never felt that way for anyone before.</p>
 <p>This time, being in the Dancing Phoenix Continent made her feel that she was at the end of the line with nowhere to go. It was only after she met Qing Shui that she felt especially elated. As time passed, she unknowingly developed those kinds of feelings for him.</p>
 <p>However, right now, she had the feeling that Qing Shui didn't like her or wasn't interested in her.</p>
 <p>She felt a little bitter. This was the first time she felt this helpless but it was an extremely horrible feeling.</p>
 <p>She didn't wish to be honest and to confess to Qing Shui. She was afraid of the reply he would give. Leaving it as it was would still give her some anticipation. She would just leave it as a dream that had not been dashed!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui returned to his room and didn't think much about it. Although Yuan Su's actions earlier seemed a little strange, it could be due to a similar situation as when they were back in the five continents. Therefore, he didn't think much about it.</p>
 <p>Entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui continued with his cultivation and tempering...</p>
 <p>The tempering this time around brought a smile to his lips. The Five Elements Divine Flag which hadn't changed in very long, suddenly leveled up. At this moment, Qing Shui felt especially agitated and quickly assessed it. It came too suddenly.</p>
 <p>Five Elements Divine Flags (Husband)!</p>
 <p>Third grade, could be refined with Blood Essence three times a day. For now, three locations could be set up within the map of the Five Elements Divine Flag. The number of locations could increase in accordance to the ascension in grades. The user could shuttle back and forth between the locations. It could be used to travel to each location once every month.</p>
 <p>State: recognized owner!</p>
 <p>It could be used together with the Five Elements Divine Flag (Wife), travelling between the two points without any restrictions. The only restriction was that it could only be used between the two owners of the Five Elements Divine Flag!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could now set the third location. He went straight into the space of the Five Elements Divine Flag. For the previous two locations, he had set one in the Central Continent and another one in the center of the Dancing Phoenix Continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still didn't know where he should set the third location yet. He had no idea if Yehuang Guwu's Five Elements Divine Flag had attained a breakthrough to a new grade yet. By rights, it should have.</p>
 <p>After all, the time required to reach the second grade wasn't long and was only for about a year. Qing Shui had been stopped before the third grade for an entire year. When he saw that he could set up a location, he was stunned for a moment.</p>
 <p>Haohan Continent!</p>
 <p>He was originally thinking of placing it at the intersection of the three continents but he now had another idea. Haohan Continent was far too big. If he were to set the point to be at the intersection between Haohan Continent, Dancing Phoenix Continent and Soaring Dragon Continent, it would be a bit of a waste.</p>
 <p>It was because he felt that Yehuang Guwu's second location should have been set on the Soaring Dragon Continent. Therefore, there was no need for him to place his on the intersection between the Haohan Continent, Dancing Phoenix Continent and the Soaring Dragon Continent.</p>
 <p>Center!</p>
 <p>This was Qing Shui's current thought. He would have to head to the Haohan Continent sooner or later. By then, the Nine Continents Boots should have leveled up as well. Therefore, Qing Shui eventually still set the location to be in the center of the vast and boundless Haohan Continent.</p>
 <p>With the Five Elements Divine Flag reaching a higher grade, together with Yehuang Guwu, he would be able to move through the nine continents as he wished. However, he had no idea what changes there would be if the Five Elements Divine Flag were to level up to a new grade again in the future</p>
