 <p><strong>AST 839 - Taking the Mysterious Fruit Once again</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui only let go of her hand with great reluctance when they had arrived above the Cloud Adventurer Guild, making Yun Duan speechless. This guy was really insatiable. To think that she had already let herself loose as it was.</p>
 <p>Although he appeared to be very mature, Yun Duan felt that it could be because of her first impression toward him. In the battle earlier, he was very upright and reliable but when he stopped, she would keep thinking of how he was when they were back in Heavenly Palace. Back then, he already looked a little more mature for his age but he was still very much like a kid.</p>
 <p>Therefore, she felt that she was slightly self-indulgent and had also allowed herself to indulge in him a little.</p>
 <p>Thinking of how he was appearing to be like a greedy kid earlier...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yun Duan jumped down from the Fire Bird. There were still many people there, most of them from Cloud Adventurer Guild. Seeing that they had returned safely, they knew that the problem was solved.</p>
 <p>However, Yun Clan and some of the core members of Cloud Adventurer Guild still rushed over. Although they had guessed what the result was, they still wanted to hear it directly from Qing Shui and Yun Duan.</p>
 <p>"Father, mother, Hu Wei Adventurer Guild is gone now." After saying this, Yun Duan hugged the beautiful woman with tears in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Although she was silent, Qing Shui knew that she was crying. This stubborn lady was still a lady after all. It was just that she was stubborn and didn't wish to show him her weaker sides.</p>
 <p>A loud cheer spread out and many people left from Cloud Adventurer Guild to spread the good news. There was nothing that could be happier than this.</p>
 <p>The few Elders from Cloud Adventurer Guild also took their leave. They had been worried about this previously since it didn't only concern their own lives but also that of their families. This time around, they knew that their persistence had paid off.</p>
 <p>It was not that people with a strong sense of righteousness were not afraid of death. No one was not afraid of death but it was a matter of whether the death was worth it. Moreover, if they were to remain alive, could they handle the responsibilities they had to bear, as well as could their consciousnesses handle it... In fact, for most people, it was just that they could not get past themselves.</p>
 <p>Now, knowing that everything was fine, they could also put down the heavy burden in their hearts. Letting out a long exhale, the few old men left happily.</p>
 <p>"Esteemed nephew [1], come, let's go back," the learned and refined looking man looked at Qing Shui happily and said.</p>
 <p>Of course he could tell that this guy did not have a simple relationship with his daughter and he could also tell that his daughter liked this guy. The situation now was as if they had left hell and headed immediately for heaven.</p>
 <p>The reason behind all the changes was because of this guy.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, come, they are already preparing the food." The beautiful married woman held Yun Duan's hand and smiled while speaking to Qing Shui. She was now the happiest out of all of them. Children are the most important thing to mothers and if their children were not living well, the mothers would be the ones who felt worst. Right now, she did not know what to do on hearing this great surprise.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan stood next to the beautiful married lady, throwing Qing Shui occasional glances, while wearing a faint smile. The refined man and the beautiful married lady, as parents, naturally noticed this scene.</p>
 <p>However, this was something they wanted to see. Moreover, there was nothing about Qing Shui which they could complain about. Anyway, if it was not for this young man, everything would have been gone. They were satisfied with the current situation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded and left for the inner hall with the Yun family. There would naturally be people who would fix and reconstruct the hall in the Adventurer Guild.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui, thank you very much," Yun Yang smiled and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Yun Chi also looked at Qing Shui happily.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui, is my elder sister beautiful?" Yun Tong chuckled and asked.</p>
 <p>"Of course she is. Is there a need to ask?" Qing Shui smiled and replied. Now, everyone's mood was relaxed and thus their conversations were much lighter too. They could even bring up less stressful topics.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui and my elder sister are such a good match." Yun Tong grinned, appearing to be very honest and straightforward. However, it was hard to link that handsome appearance to a person who was very honest.</p>
 <p>"Younger brother, if you're going to continue with that crap, you can have sword practice with me in a while," Yun Duan chided.</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright, I'll stop." Yun Tong quickly said. He had no intention of being a punching bag.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not see Yun Duan's eldest brother. The latter probably was too embarrassed to appear before him. It might be good to let him stay away for a while. He tossed this thought aside. This was Yun Clan's family issues. He was neither in the mood nor was there a need for him to be bothered with this.</p>
 <p>The dishes served were quite extensive. It was late and it was dinner time. Yun Peng and the beautiful married woman casually asked about Qing Shui's family situation. If they didn't it would appear as if they didn't show any interest but if they were to probe too much, it would make him feel uncomfortable. Therefore, they only asked a few casual questions. However, Qing Shui replied more since they would be able to get a better understanding about the situation without them asking too much.</p>
 <p>Toward Qing Shui's courtesy, Yun Peng, the beautiful married woman and the people from Yun Clan were all very happy.</p>
 <p>They had an enjoyable meal together and the atmosphere was very good. When one was in a good mood, anything would taste delicious. They finished the dinner about two hours later.</p>
 <p>Everyone departed after the meal and Yun Duan was naturally the person to bring Qing Shui to his room. However, thinking of Qing Shui's words during the day, she felt a little nervous and uneasy.</p>
 <p>Walking out of the hall, Yun Duan led Qing Shui to the building. Although it was dark at night, the moon and stars in the sky as well as the light stones all around lit the place up.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, they held each other's hands and slowly walked to the other building. While it was a short distance away, they took a very long time to walk over.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, how long will you be staying here?" Yun Duan smiled and asked softly.</p>
 <p>"About three to five days. Or maybe I'll leave tomorrow," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said. He didn't want to lie to her. He wanted to head to Eastern Victory Divine Continent to look for medicinal herbs. Of course, if there was Sky Penetrating Grass which was 5,000 Years or older, he didn't mind staying here longer.</p>
 <p>Clearly, Qing Shui's reply was within Yun Duan's expectation. She was not surprised and merely smiled and answered, "Will you come back and look for me in the future?"</p>
 <p>After making their relationship clear, the two of them were now much more intimate in their conversation. Qing Shui only said this because he wouldn't be staying long. Moreover, they had been very intimate on the Fire Bird, with her being the one to express her feelings first.</p>
 <p>"I will. You're my woman. If I'm alive and have time, I'll come and visit you," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Don't be saying such unlucky stuff." Yun Duan covered Qing Shui's mouth and said seriously.</p>
 <p>They walked into the building. She stayed in this place alone. The building was not very big, with only three levels in total. There were no rooms on the first level. There was only a hall, kitchen, bathroom and such.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you can go look for a room on the second floor. I'll go talk a bath..." After walking into the hall, Yun Duan said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Let's have a bath together. I want to have one too..."</p>
 <p>Before Yun Duan could reply, Qing Shui picked her up and headed for the bathroom.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui..." Yun Duan called out a few times shyly and then entered the bathroom with Qing Shui smirking.</p>
 <p>The bathroom was neither very big nor very small. There was a big bathtub which was six feet long and wide and four feet deep. Qing Shui filled up the tub.</p>
 <p>Looking at the flushed red lady in his arms, Qing Shui noticed that he was slightly agitated at this moment. He found it funny himself. He knew that this was because he was not that familiar with this lady, although they had spent a night together previously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still carrying Yun Duan but he was already kissing her lips while his hands started to remove her clothes!</p>
 <p>It might be because she knew that Qing Shui was going to leave very soon that Yun Duan didn't resist too much and let him do as he wished. Very quickly, they were both undressed.</p>
 <p>She had beautiful snow-white skin and a graceful and curvy figure.</p>
 <p>She was warm to the touch and the tender feeling made Qing Shui enchanted. He released the slightly reddened lips and carried her into the bathtub.</p>
 <p>The water in the bathtub only reached up in their chests, leaving Yun Duan's upper body above the water. Qing Shui could not control himself and grabbed the snow-white and well-rounded peaks.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan's face turn slightly red from her blush and with the heat from the steam. She let out steamy gasps and there was an indescribable charm added to this graceful lady.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not hold back the urge and embraced her, connecting with her.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the lady sleeping in his arms who had a hint of satisfaction on her beautiful face. He thought of how he had wanted her many times over the night. To think that such a graceful lady would also have such a crazy side to her. It might be because he wouldn't be staying for long that she only fell asleep a short while ago.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the sky. It was already late in the night. He dared not move for fear of waking up the beauty in his arms.</p>
 <p>It was only after Yun Duan was deeply asleep that Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, the second Mysterious Fruit is also mature now."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the two Mysterious Fruits he now had. The ratio of the time flow in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had increased once again, making it even faster for the medicinal herbs to grow. After some cultivation, Qing Shui planned to use the two Mysterious Fruits.</p>
 <p>When there was only one of it, Qing Shui felt that the chances were too low. He was afraid that it would be too depressing should he fail.</p>
 <p>He put both Mysterious Fruits next to him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still very agitated, if he was lucky enough, he might be able to breakthrough to the seventh heavenly layer. However, Qing Shui was not having such high hopes. He would be satisfied if he could get some advancement.</p>
 <p>Although the Mysterious Fruit only had a 1% chance of success, this was only so for other people. Qing Shui didn't know what was the success rate for himself but it would definitely be higher than 1%.</p>
 <p>He had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal which was tied together with his life. Just this alone would increase his success rate by quite abit. Moreover, he also had the Nature Energy and the Unmoving Like A Mountain.</p>
 <p>In fact, there was still one thing which had a close connection with success rate...</p>
 <p>Comprehension!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his comprehension level was still quite high. Otherwise, he would not have been able entered epiphany for so many times.</p>
 <p>After circulating the Ancient Strengthening Technique for one round, Qing Shui then circulated Unmoving Like A Mountain and even used an amplifying Heavenly Talisman, bringing the condition of his body to the best it could be.</p>
 <p>His Nature Energy circulated automatically. There was also the Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection, Diamond Crossing Rivers and others...</p>
 <p>He then took one of the Mysterious Fruits, tossing aside all distracting thoughts, calming his mind and increasing the speed at which he was circulating the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. He focused and tried to comprehend the power from the Mysterious Fruit in his body.</p>
 <p>Time passed by slowly and Qing Shui didn't move at all. His hands formed signs as he slowly controlled the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique in his body slowly, gradually absorbing the power from the Mysterious Fruit.</p>
 <p>Having experienced this one, Qing Shui tried his best to do what he did the previous time, trying hard not to let the power of the Mysterious Fruit to seep out of his body.</p>
