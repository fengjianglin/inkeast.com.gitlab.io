 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today was a joyful yet busy day. Fortunately, all of them were not ordinary people. There was no need to stay in confinement following childbirth, as they were able to recuperate quite fast and swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, Yiye Jiange fell asleep soon after her childbirth. Her child was asleep too. Most children would spend the majority of their time sleeping anyways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will take care of things here. Just go run your errands!” the Sunset Palace Mistress said to Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me do it. Besides, I don’t have anything to do.” Qing Shui shook his head as he smiled in reply. Yiye Jiange was, after all, his woman. Taking care of her was naturally his responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re just a man. I still think it’s better for us to handle this sort of thing. Come on, just listen to me. Go!” the Sunset Palace Mistress did not allow Qing Shui to continue and shoved him out of the room quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed helplessly and did not persist in staying further. In any case, no one could possibly hide anything from him in this small courtyard. After being hustled away, he went straight to a building nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were four small buildings situated in the small courtyard. Each of them was three stories high and their floor spaces were relatively sufficient. The courtyards of quadrangles had the same arrangements, except that they had three courtyards in the front, middle, and back. Four buildings stood opposite one another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange were the only ones living here. However, the three ladies were now living inside the building, which was the same one that Yiye Jiange was currently living in. Four of them couldn’t even fill one storey as the space inside was sufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After walking into a room, Qing Shui remembered that he had a reaction in his body the moment his child was born. It wasn’t until now that he decided to check his body for the reaction. Now that he had the time, he couldn’t help but quickly enter into his own sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, he discovered that his power had once again been purified aplenty. Moreover, he was able to discover what had been added to his sea of consciousness very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique had been awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the last form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, and the most mysterious one among them all. The Dragon Form had finally awakened after being dormant for a long time. Qing Shui was particularly excited and couldn’t wait to see what kind of techniques he could learn right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Yang Dragon Soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This could potentially increase the might of the Heavenly Technique and the Sure Kill technique once it has been successfully cultivated. The prowess of this ability would be affected by the level increase in realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pair of mysterious air fists that were both powerful and magical could bypass a definite amount of defense, which was effective in landing a severe blow to an opponent. The prowess of this technique could be affected by the increase in realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s physical strength had currently reached about 100,000 sun. He hadn’t had any improvement to his strength initially, but after the awakening of the Dragon Form, his power had received a significant boost. Under the influence of a powerful Heavenly Technique and a few treasures, his strength would be able to reach to the force of 4,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s previous abilities and techniques had already been integrated into his body like the Heart of Roc, which had already been integrated into his Seven-colored Pellet. This was also considered a type of breakthrough in which the cultivation had reached its limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he watched the newly formed Dragon Form, the Nine Yang Dragon Soul and Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant were definitely techniques of the legendary level at the very least. However, he wasn’t able to control these techniques straight away like he used to. Even if he was able to control them for only a little bit, it would be great. Unfortunately for him, these techniques were completely foreign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In spite of that, Qing Shui wasn’t particularly worried. He could guarantee that he would be able to control these techniques well. The Nine Animals Mimicry Technique was considered an inheritance ability. Qing Shui was confident that he would be able to master the cultivation of these techniques in the shortest amount of time possible. After all, this was his own inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Yang Dragon Soul was a spirit of the Dragon Form. This was the very foundation of the form, which could even affect the cultivation of the next battle technique. Because of that, he had to train hard for this technique. The Nine Yang in front of its name made Qing Shui think of his own Nine Yang body. He had a feeling that there would be some effect, regardless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw the Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant, his eyes lit up. He felt that this battle technique would definitely bring a great effect when combined with the Emperor’s Qi, Art of Pursuing, Heavenly Talisman, and Vajra Subdues Demon - perhaps even more terrifying than he had expected. He would be able to leave his opponents in a state of dejection until they died. When Qing Shui imagined that scenario, he became excited. He could not turn away from the scenario of a powerful martial warrior being weakened and then wounded by his technique, that could ignore his opponent’s defense….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had the time now, so he directly went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This was the advantage to this realm now - one day in the real world was equivalent to half a year’s worth of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui practiced the chant of the Nine Yang Dragon Soul first. When he took a look of the chant, he was able to realize the function of the Nine Yang. Only those with Nine Yang bodies would be able to cultivate the domineering Nine Yang Dragon Soul to its peak. Other people would never be able to unleash even half its power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During his cultivation, he was also able to discover the terror of the Nine Yang body. This might be related to his inheritance too. Moreover, Qing Shui’s speed in cultivating the Nine Yang Dragon Soul could only be described with the word ‘terrifying’. This was considered an unusual cultivation, as he was able to grasp the important point very quickly. After that, he would only have to concentrate on the chant and allow the Origin Qi and Qi of Nine Yang to form the Force of the Dragon Soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the time went by slowly, the energy that had been accumulated in his body circulated again and again while being condensed bit by bit. This wasn’t about whether this process could fail, but whether it could succeed or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea what success looked like, but he would definitely know the moment he succeeded. He was able to perform the incantations of the Nine Yang Dragon Soul with ease after he had become proficient in its mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an unknown period of time, a distinct sound rang out, as if something had opened up. After that, a mysterious energy surged from within his body, just like ripples that were caused by throwing a rock down in stagnant water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A slightly weak yet domineering force began to swell up slowly, which then extended throughout his entire body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did he succeed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t confirm it himself, but his intuition told him that he had indeed succeeded, albeit in terms of barely mastering part of it. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to increase his power in just a short time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Qing Shui had used up all the time within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal since he had upgraded the realm to ninth grade. His progress was satisfactory. If he continued to keep up the pace, he should be able to truly master the cultivation in just a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he got out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the sky was beginning to grow darker. As he walked toward Yiye Jiange’s room, he saw the three ladies chattering about something happily, while the little guy was still fast asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then sat beside Yiye Jiange’s bed. Her body had already recovered quite swiftly, as she was able to get down from her bed without a problem. She had been pregnant for ten months, and now that she had already given birth to her son, she seemed much more relaxed.</span></p>

Even though Qing Hanye had mentioned that she would form an alliance with the Sunset Sea King Palace, this idea was quickly rejected by Qing Shui. He felt that the current status of both palaces was good enough for now.</span></p>

The Old Ancestor of Dragonwolf Palace was none other than Qing Hanye’s master. The reason that Qing Hanye was able stand here today was because of her master. Her master held an important place in her heart, much like how Qing Shui was important to her.</span></p>

Her master was already the Old Ancestor of the Dragonwolf Palace. Qing Shui had never seen Qing Hanye’s master before, even after he had become the Dragonwolf Palace’s protector. He only knew that she had secluded herself to cultivate.</span></p>

This was a custom in this world. A baby shower was the theme, due to the birth of his son.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qing Shui did not reject the idea of it and took the chance to increase bonds by gathering people together. Moreover, this was an occasion worth celebrating.</span></p>

The majority of the guests were people from the nearby sea area, who intended to curry favor with the Sunset Sea King Palace.</span></p>
