 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;With the Divine Wood Essence, Qing Shui felt even more confident. Not only had his Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines became a lot more powerful, it also possessed fearsome defense. It could be used to protect himself as well as the people around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Other than the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, Qing Shui also cultivated his Golden Sword. After all, he swallowed the golden and fire pearl before. For the fire elements, he cultivated the Primordial Flame, Primordial Flame Whip, and so on, furthermore, he already had very high attainments in them. The earth element, for the time being, only consisted of the Nine Continents Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Other than the Divine Wood Essence of the wood attribute, it was fairly easy to train the rest of the elements. Time went on little by little, but Qing Shui remained calm and had a stable mindset. Unknowingly, it was already time for him to head out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;By the time he exited the realm, six hours have passed in the outside world. Muyun Qingge was ready to leave. However, she didn’t summon out the White Jade Battle King Crab. Qing Shui also didn’t try to question her why.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Let’s go!” Qing Shui said after looking around the surrounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Yes, you don't need to look for her anymore. I didn’t let her out.” Muyun Qingge smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Somehow, Qing Shui now found the woman a bit different from how she used to be. Though he didn't know why she seemed to have become a bit easier to approach. She was more conscious with her words now, this was a sign that she felt closer to the person she was talking to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The things which happened in Luoqing City this time has helped her to have an even deeper comprehension towards human life. Perhaps, the perceptions she used to have before might not be completely right, but escaping from it wasn’t a solution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;However, it also didn’t seem that easy to make her feel at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;In Fact, Qing Shui wasn’t able to fully understand her thoughts. Even her preference, whether he likes something or not, Qing Shui wasn’t sure about them. Hence, from this viewpoint, Qing Shui began to wonder if he was the one that’s overthinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am not looking for her.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Well then, what are you looking for?” Muyun Qingge asked casually. She didn’t believe what Qing Shui said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am looking at you.” Qing Shui responded casually. Suddenly, he came to understand something, there was no need for him to avoid these kinds of stuff, nor did he have to mind it that much. Going with the flow was the best thing to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;However, it also seemed like it wouldn’t be so easy to do so. Luckily, he has managed to find his direction for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“For what?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because you look pretty!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Muyun Qingge stopped talking. She felt that this man was a bit different today, but she was not able to tell exactly how.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“This place is in the middle of nowhere. For such an exceptional beauty like you to be here, even I feel like doing something to you……” As Qing Shui was speaking, a greedy look flashed across his eyes. He was examining Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Muyun Qingge got shocked when she saw Qing Shui’s look. But very quickly, she began smiling, “Alright, let’s go. I absolutely don’t look like an exceptional beauty.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui was speechless. In what way was she not like an exceptional beauty? He was staring at the outstanding woman in front of him with a happy expression, while her busts were slightly shaking, emitting a bewitching and charming aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;She belonged to the Drakaina Tribe, therefore, her figure looked like it was made by the heaven itself. This kind of seduction came from deep within her soul and bone. She could easily emit it without any effort, the more natural the beauty was, the more devastating it would be. In fact, maybe she wasn’t even aware of the charm she had within herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui was a bit stunned. However, he still retained a bit of his consciousness. In a seemingly uncontrollable manner, Qing Shui gently stepped in front and held her hand. It felt tender like jade and soft like there wasn’t even a bone in it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Muyun Qingge tried to retract her hand, but very quickly, she dismissed such intention. Her face blushed as she spoke, “Wake up!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She has known Qing Shui for many years. She knew that he wasn’t that kind of man. She was also aware of her own charm, she just didn’t expect herself to be able to attract this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui smiled, but he didn’t let go, “Let’s move. For such an extreme beauty to be by my side, I have a feeling that I have been wasting a lot of my opportunities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui wasn’t loud, but Muyun Qingge was able to hear him clearly. She felt speechless upon hearing what he said. She raised her hand and punched him, “Nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Her half happy and half grumpy expression made her looks cute. With his utmost effort, Qing Shui turned his head and immediately used the Nine Continents Step Effect. He was really afraid that he would lose control and kiss her or did even worse things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holding hands was already her limit. Furthermore, this was also due to special circumstances between her and Qing Shui. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to even hold her hands. ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A few days passed. Overall, their journey could be considered as a safe one. They didn’t really run into any sort of danger. However, halfway through their journey, they did come across a few formidable and ferocious beasts. At one point, they even encountered a group of ferocious beasts. Luckily, with the Nine Continents Step Effect, they managed to run away from them. Qing Shui also gave her his Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring. This way, even if they really did come across any sort of danger, she would be able to instantaneously teleported herself away. Furthermore, she could use it continuously for up to a hundred times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The ring wasn’t that useful to Qing Shui anymore, given that he had the Nine Continents Step's Effect, as well as the realm and the Hell Nightmare Beast. There were only very few occasions when he would use it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were already close to the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave, if all went well, they would be able to arrive within three days. At the moment, Qing Shui has located a group of mountains at the bottom of the sea. Legend said that the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave resided deep within this group of mountains. The Sacred Mountain could also be found among these mountains. Furthermore, it was the tallest one and located deep among the mountains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t we settle down here for today? After that, we will go in right away.” Qing Shui was looking at the boundless mountains in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Alright, it’s already the ninth day. We managed to arrive at this place within ten days, I am sure we will find the Sacred Mudra Flower.” Muyun Qingge let out a sigh of relief in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“These are for you. It will help in boosting your combat power.” Qing Shui took out a battle skirt, battle boots, and a few arrows. All of these were forged by him recently when he was in the realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, both the battle boots and battle skirts were at False God grade, which was an entire level higher than the so-called legendary grades in the past. They were also by far, the best things which Qing Shui has ever forged. As for Divine Artifacts, it required more than just heavenly forging techniques, it also required materials at Divine Artifact grade.</span></p>

The Sun Shooting Bow was capable of turning into a sword. It could also transform back into a bow and unleash one of the most powerful long-ranged attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was because she could feel that every single object was made by Qing Shui. This was something which Qing Shui made specifically for her.</span></p>

Make sure you can use it well.” Qing Shui smiled and said. He was also curious to see Muyun Qingge’s look after she wore on all of these.&nbsp;</span></p>

She only came out after quite a while. The purple battle dress and boots gave her a kind of noble aura which words couldn’t describe. She was just like a goddess who came out from a painting. Her exquisite face which looked like a Goddess, as well as her perfect body figure… Her beautiful hair was tied up on her head. Overall, she looked dignified and mature.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qing Shui was doing it on purpose. At the same time, this also hinted as a compliment to a woman.</span></p>

Our time is limited, in fact, I don’t even know what you did to actually achieve such perfections in your cultivation, medicine refining technique as well as forging technique.” Muyun Qingge was curious and looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
