 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2298 - Getting Stronger, Waiting for Battle</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Qing Shui said his piece and was about to leave, Beihuang Fan opened the door, reached out her hand and pulled Qing Shui in. She then closed the door, blushing like a tomato. "Can you not shout here? Sister is right next door and can hear you very clearly. Even if you aren't embarrassed, I am..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan tugged at Qing Shui's collar with her face flushed red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was stunned. To think that this great beauty had this cute side to her. Right now, she appeared to be very shy, her beautiful eyes glistening with a hint of mist in them. Her gaze seemed to be deep, bottomless, and extremely beautiful. The mystical feeling could be felt exuding from those very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled, held her by the waist, and said softly next to her ears, "I want to hear you say 'I want it!'"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan shivered. Although she had yet to become husband and wife with Qing Shui, she knew that their relationship was no different from that of a married couple. It was just that they had yet to take the last step. Right now, hearing Qing Shui's intimate words, she shivered and her face turned extremely red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at Beihuang Fan who was in his arms and refused to lift her head. He saw her glistening ears and kissed one gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most women's ears were on the sensitive side. Thus, having experienced that, Beihuang Fan trembled. She was hugging Qing Shui, not letting him move, "You aren't allowed to do naughty things!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then tell me, do you want me to give you a massage? If you say no, then it means that you want to do the actual thing with me. Hehe… Go ahead, take your pick between the two." Qing Shui grinned as he said that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Will you only feel happy after bullying me so much that I have no more pride when I'm before you? If that's the case, then I'll satisfy you now," Beihuang Fan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui quickly let go and said seriously, "Alright, alright… I have rushed it too much. But I'll definitely work hard so that in the future, you'll tear off my clothes and violate me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Pah! I can't expect any proper words coming out from your mouth." Beihuang Fan almost fainted from anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they fooled around a little, Qing Shui kissed Beihuang Fan thoroughly before giving her a round of massage. Time passed by very quickly as he massaged her back. Moving his hand toward her round peaks, he kneaded those fluffy ‘delicacy’ skillfully. This made Beihuang Fan once again feel that ecstatical feeling; moaning sounds rang out dynamically. Toward the end, she grabbed onto Qing Shui, not letting go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was stunned for a while before he carried her and laid her down on her bed. Right now, Beihuang Fan was panting slightly and was still immersed in that ecstatic feeling. At this moment, Qing Shui slowly removed her clothes that were thin to begin with. Her pajamas were snow-white in color, without any taints on it. It was a little loose, and when she wore it, she was just like an angelic fairy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing Qing Shui's actions, Beihuang Fan grabbed onto her clothes and said softly, "Qing Shui, can you wait a little longer? I only belong to you alone."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won't eat you up. I'll just take a look over here, okay? I'll just be taking a look!" Qing Shui's gaze landed on the protruding buns at her chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her breasts were bulging, giving off a sense of dimension. They weren't terrifyingly huge but were definitely considered to be on the bigger side. Their suppleness was unmatchable. Even though she was lying down on the bed at the moment, they were still protruding proudly, not showing signs of deformation at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan released her hands softly. With her blushing so hard, she couldn’t bring herself to look at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui removed her clothes gently, and the pair of snow-white jumped out with brilliance. They were very beautiful, round, and well-embodied. Their snow-white jade color, the faint fragrance of flowers, as well as the red peaks at the very top emitted a lethal seduction, causing Qing Shui to be unable to blink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan closed her eyes, feeling embarrassed. She knew that Qing Shui wasn't an innocent man. Although he wouldn't take her completely, he could still satisfy some of his cravings with his hands or mouth...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The buns were soft and supple, unable to be contained within one hand. Beihuang Fan opened her eyes and looked at Qing Shui, "You didn't keep to your words!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean?" Qing Shui rubbed them gently, making them turn into various shapes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You said that you'd only look..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm looking at them right now..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Fan`er, look at how beautiful they are. They look even more delicious than the greatest delicacies." Qing Shui held one in each hand and couldn't stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan's body kept trembling and she felt numb all over. Qing Shui's hands were very hot but were filled with endless demonic grace, making her feel very comfortable. Although she was very embarrassed, she still held some anticipation that he would continue on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Qing Shui still had a taste of the forbidden peaks. They were extremely delicious, and it stimulated his already excited nerves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan reached two more climaxes, and Qing Shui kissed her all over. In the end, he was chased away by Beihuang Fan and returned to his room. She was afraid that if she were to stay in the same room as Qing Shui, they might really end up doing it until the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wasn't really against Qing Shui. It was just that for one, she wasn't prepared. Another reason was that with her cultivation, it was not good for her to lose her virginity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another week had passed by, and no one from the Chi Clan had come anymore. The news of the She Clan had spread out and even if they were to send more people here, they wouldn't arrive unless half a month had passed. Therefore, it was normal for them to not have appeared all this while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hordes of Chi clansmen had come back then. By right if the Chi Clan still had their people out there, they would already have come, yet there hadn't been anyone coming this week. However, they still kept the hope that after this episode, there might still be people coming. It was because after this fight, they had a feeling that they might have the chance to resolve their grudge, their anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for people who aimed to do great things, such situations were very normal. There was no love that happened without a reason, nor was there any hatred that came without a reason. It wasn't that other people were realistic or not loyal, but that you weren't capable. Why would people follow you if you weren't capable?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Which one of them wouldn’t be able to garner countless people like this with just a call after displaying strength? This was a fact. Therefore, after this fight, it would also be a good thing for those people from the Chi Clan to come back. It would be a lot better than to get new people to help out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, everyone was clear that the She Clan would come back again. The next time was the crucial point. If the Chi Clan could continue to fight off the She Clan again next time, many people from the Chi Clan, who were still alive, would all come back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Chi Clan had a period of brilliance back then in the Lower Three Regions. Many of them were accustomed to that kind of lifestyle, and they were merely trying to take refuge in their decision to leave the Chi Clan. Therefore, their lives wouldn't be satisfactory. If they were to see the Chi Clan rising up once again and were calling for their return, they would naturally come back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the Chi Clan kept on training non-stop. Qing Shui invested a lot this time around, giving the members from the Chi Clan's main branch medicinal pills. Furthermore, he also did one round of impurities cleansing for them and imparted them with battle techniques. It could be considered a present to Chi Ao and Chi Feng for their return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not much time had passed by, but the Chi Clan had gotten a lot stronger overall, especially Chi Yang and his wife. They were already quite strong to begin with, and now they had stepped up a notch. Moreover, with the growth of Chi Yang’s pernicious aura, Qing Shui was now able to use the gold needles as a guide to help him break through his cultivation barrier. Qing Shui then gave him the Tribulation Evasion Pill that allowed him to experience a Divine Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After successfully attaining a breakthrough, along with getting one round of Qing Shui’s impurities cleansing and constitution nurturing, Chi Yang's strength right now was already similar to Qing Shui's defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, Qing Shui had managed to push Chi Yang's potential to a decent level. In his entire lifetime, it would be hard for him to attain a breakthrough past 1.5 trillion Dao Force, but he was now close to reaching 1.4 trillion Dao Force. This was already considered to be at the peak for him, moreover, there were not many who could defeat him one-on-one in the Lower Three Regions. Even if they were to defeat him, they would have to pay quite a huge price.</span></p>
