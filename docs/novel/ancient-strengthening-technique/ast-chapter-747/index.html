 <p><strong>AST 747 - Two are pregnant, Body of a Hundred Flowers, heading towards Southern Viewing Continent</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried a child in each of his hands and kissed their pinkish cheeks, causing the two little fellows to laugh incessantly. Canghai Mingyue took Qing Jun over from him and held his hand without saying anything more, while the two children continuously used their hands to pull their parents’ ears. Only in moments like this did Qing Shui know what was called family love and joy. Occasionally having eye contact with Canghai Mingyue, this feeling felt very warm and happy.</p>
 <p>Thinking back on the matter between him and Canghai Mingyue, it was truly an unexpected advancement as he had walked into the wrong room then. However it seems that he did not make the wrong decision and never would have imagined that he would get these two children. Furthermore, when the children were born, it allowed him to breakthrough the most important barrier to his strength.</p>
 <p>The ambiguous relationship between him and Canghai Mingyue, that was not brought to light, had now broken the final stage, however Qing Shui had gone towards the Central Continent. And when he returned she was already pregnant. He was able to let her feel his love for her before she had children. Due to this, Qing Shui had seemingly used all of his time with her.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou tightly hugged Qing Shui without saying a word. This woman had always supported Qing Shui silently and never requested anything from him. She was dignified and mature, a pure, holy and traditional women</p>
 <p>“Gelou!”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m expecting.” said Mingyue Gelou softly in Qing Shui’s ears.</p>
 <p>“You’re expecting? Expecting what?” asked Qing Shui curiously.</p>
 <p>“Dummy, I’m expecting your child.”replied Mingyue Gelou bashfully as she raised her head and looked at Qing Shui. Her shy and bashful expression was exceptionally breathtaking on that beautiful face, particularly that vermillion dot on between her eyebrows, which added three points of allure and sensual appeal. This coupled with her dignified aura created an inconceivably perfect union.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, that’s so great!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged and spun her for a couple of rounds as he laughed. He was really very happy, as he knew that Mingyue Gelou had all along wished to give birth to a child for him. In actual fact Qing Shui had also wish for her to conceive, as she could feel that it was hard for her to integrate with his life if she did not have his child. Afterall, Yuchang was brought over by her, and she had felt that only by having his child would she be considered to have a tightly linked relationship with him.</p>
 <p>Children are the link between parents and preserved a very important existence between a male and female. In his past life the rates of divorce for those couples without children were much higher than those who have them. This was due to both parties not having any responsibilities. The relationship between a male and a female will have a subtle change when there are children. The degree of closeness between two will gradually increase and would not be the same as the deep attachment between them in the past. Affection has a limit and would slowly fade over time, however this was different from family love.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, be careful of the child.” said Mingyue Gelou as she hugged Qing Shui tightly.</p>
 <p>“I will try my best to be back before the child is born, however for this period of time it will be hard on you.” said Qing Shui guiltily as he kissed her beautiful face.</p>
 <p>“The matters you have to do are important. You don’t have to worry about what happens in the family. It will be alright.” replied Mingyue Gelou, the smile on her face never fading.</p>
 <p>Looking at how happy she was, Qing Shui also felt very happy. A woman as good as her should always be happy!</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou felt that meeting with Qing Shui was the compensation that the heavens had made to her. Yu Chang's life was saved by Qing Shui, and he had even saved her from the Tan Family...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui entered Shi Qingzhuang’s room, the beautiful lady, that gave an impression of being cold and detached, was standing lost in thought by the window. Upon seeing Qing Shui, a faint smile that only belonged to her appeared on her face.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>“Why are you so lost in thought alone?” asked Qing Shui with a smile. Walking over, he grabbed her hand and her shoulder and stood by the window.</p>
 <p>Shi Qingzhuang hesitated for a while and was trying to say something. In the end, she softly said, “You’re leaving tomorrow right? You definitely have to be careful.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, please feel relaxed. Your husband isn’t someone who would die prematurely. Furthermore I’ve such a big beauty thinking about me, how can I bear to die?” replied Qing Shui with a smile as he tilted his head and looked at that cool and elegant yet delicate face.</p>
 <p>“You’re so flippant, wait a minute!”</p>
 <p>Saying finish, Shi Qingzhuang walked to her bedroom and came out with a jet black belt. From the first look one could tell it was handmade, in addition it seemed that the handicraft was not that good.</p>
 <p>She made it...</p>
 <p>“You’re not allowed to say it’s ugly and you’re not allowed to reject it.” said Shi Qingzhuang as her face turned red.</p>
 <p>“It’s nice looking, it’s nice looking. This is the best looking one I’ve ever seen in my life. How could I reject it? If anyone dares to snatch from me I’ll find him.” relied Qing Shui hurriedly in a honest manner.</p>
 <p>“Alright! I’ll help you put it on.” said Shi Qingzhuang with a laugh.</p>
 <p>Grabbing one end of the belt, Shi Qingzhuang looped the other end around Qing Shui’s waist; she looked like she was giving him a hug before tying the ends together.The jet black belt matched Qing Shui’s clothes very well, creating an even more swift and fierce overbearing aura around him.</p>
 <p>Looking at such a cool and elegant woman gently helping him to bind the belt, Qing Shui felt an indescribable feeling surging through his brain. This was his first woman.</p>
 <p>In a single move Qing Shui carried her and walked into the bedroom, causing her to immediately blushed and hurriedly said, “No, you’re not allowed to be that barbarous.”</p>
 <p>“Why not? Is that coming?” asked Qing Shui doubtfully as he saw that Shi Qingzhuang seemed not truly not permit him.</p>
 <p>“I’m expecting your child.” said Shi Qingzhuang while being so embarrassed that she did not raise her head up.</p>
 <p>Hearing two women say these words to him, Qing Shui felt extremely happy in his heart. After all, they had also wanted children and their current age was just right to have kids.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”asked Qing Shui. Thinking back to the scene where she was staring blankly out of the window, she should be thinking about this during that time.</p>
 <p>“I was afraid that you would get worried.”</p>
 <p>“If you don’t inform me I’ll get worried. You don’t even inform me of such an important thing.”said Qing Shui with a smile as he carried her and sat on the bed.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I know.” replied Shi Qingzhuang with a faint smile as she looked at Qing Shui. The faint smile of hers was filled with the feeling of bliss.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At night Qing Shui went to stay at Huoyun Luoli and Canghai Mingyue’s rooms!</p>
 <p>On the afternoon of the second day, Qing Shui, Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji and Bai Gui the four of them prepared to head to the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent. Qing Shui’s family, Elder Ge of the Heavenly Palace and the rest of the people all came to send them off.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, take care!” said Wenren Wushang repeatedly as she smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>With a smile, Qing Shui came over and gave her a hug. He wanted to give her a little courage before leaving. Whispering softly by her ear, he said, “Wushuang, you are my woman. Don’t try to run away in this life or the next. You better not run away.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll not run. I’ll wait for you. I’ll forever be your woman.” whispered Wenren Wushuang softly into Qing Shui’s ear. Her beautiful face turned red, however as she was about to part with him, her courage grew larger.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gawked, and without batting an eyelid he gave a kiss on her earlobe and even on her beautiful cheeks before letting her go.</p>
 <p>“Mother, grandfather…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Qing Yi embraced each other before he told them to feel relaxed. After waving good bye to the other people, he joined Cang Wuya and the rest and mounted the Fire Bird, slowing flying out of everyone’s sight.</p>
 <p>It’s painful to say goodbye!</p>
 <p>Saying goodbye will always be painful. Even this kind of goodbye would still make people feel especially sad, therefore no one would wish to face a goodbye.</p>
 <p>No one had been to the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent, however they had a good understanding of how the continent worked. Therefore they had planned to reach the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent before making inquires about the Donggong Family.</p>
 <p>With the fame of the Donggong Family, it should be easily found, therefore they did not fret over this. The only worry they had was the strength of the Donggong Family and Qing Shui and the rest hoped that they would be not that strong.</p>
 <p>However Qing Shui currently has the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable and after feeding the Beast Pill to it, its current strength was already much stronger than before. This made Qing Shui’s self-confidence increase by quite a lot.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that he could not use the Nine Continents Travel, which made him feel quite depressed, as the journey was very boring and furthermore it was such a long distance.</p>
 <p>The journey was comparatively more safe,as there was no large demonic beasts and demonic beast hordes!</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do we find the Donggong Family immediately upon arriving at the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent?” asked Cang Wuya as he looked towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“The so called, know yourself, know your enemy and you will be forever victorious. However, when we arrive it would be best if we settle down first and not goout to hunt for information for a while. Since we are from another place, if we were to directly enquire about the Donggong Family it might make people suspicious.” said Qing Shui as he thought about it. He definitely felt the needed to slowly probe the strength of the Donggong Family before proceeding with their plans. If they were very strong, they would just postpone their plans and return in a few years, as this trip would still not be a waste.</p>
 <p>“Yes, hope that our trip goes smoothly and without a hitch.” said Cang Wuya with a sigh.</p>
 <p>Fei Wuji did not say anything, however Qing Shui could see from his expression that he was slightly emotional and the impatience that he could not verbally express. He had suppressed his emotions for too long.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Hundred Flowers Valley!</p>
 <p>“He’er, you’re thinking about him again.” said a old lady with white hair and a kid’s complexion. Faintly smiling, she walked towards the side of Yu He.</p>
 <p>This was the Hundred Flowers Valley and everywhere was fresh flowers. Although all those fresh flowers were incomparably brightly coloured, there were quite a lot within them that were extremely poisonous. Standing within the cluster of flowers, Yu He looked like a goddess with a hundred flowers around her.</p>
 <p>“Master, you’ve arrived. I’m not thinking about him.”replied Yu He as she smiled towards the Hundred Flowers Grandma.</p>
 <p>“Lass, you can lie to your master. Your longing for him has already seeped into your bones.” said the old grandma with a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, what’s the point in thinking about him? I don’t want anybody to give in to me, even love is not possible. I’d rather hide him forever deep within my heart.” replied Yu He while sighing.</p>
 <p>“Three years, in three years your Hundred Flowers Secret Arts should reach an advanced accomplishment level. At that time you will take over the Hundred Flowers Valley and will be able to bring the Hundred Flowers Valley and appear on the World of the Nine Continents, allowing the glory and splendor of the yester years to reappear.” said the old grandma happily.</p>
 <p>“Master, I’m afraid that I’ll disappoint you. The Hundred Flowers Valley is already a super sect. Will I be able to do it?” asked Yu He as she looked towards Hundred Flowers grandma.</p>
 <p>“Yes you can. You have the rarely seen Body of a Hundred Flowers. This Hundred Flowers Secret Arts is specifically tailored for you. At that time the name of the Goddess of a Hundred Flowers would definitely become famous across the nine continent. At that time, the Hundred Flowers Valley would also be well known to people.” replied the Hundred flowers grandma confidently.</p>
 <p>Yu He clenched her fists tightly: “ Three years, in three years I can go and find him…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The northern region of the Nine Continents was the Northern Sacred Lu Continent. The eastern region was the Greencloud Continent. The southern region was the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. The central region was the Central Territory. The northwest region was the Western Bull and Crane Continent. The northeast region was the Soaring Dragon Continent. The southwest region was Thee Dancing Phoenix Continent and the southeast region was the Vast Ocean Continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was born in the Greencloud continent. He had travelled to the Central Territory and this was the third continent that he had travelled to. The nine continents are very vast and as of now Qing Shui did not know if he was able to travel across the Nine Continents.</p>
