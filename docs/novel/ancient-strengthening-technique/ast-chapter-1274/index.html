 <p><strong>AST 1274 - Put down the Butcher’s Knife, Formation Eye Stone, Divine Beast’s Blood</strong></p>
 <p>The voice which came through out of nowhere made Qing Shui’s flesh creep. It felt as if he was being spied on, it felt really uncomfortable just like when someone didn’t wear any clothes in public.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body felt as if it suddenly went into an extremely cold place. The hair all over his body immediately stood on end. He felt as if his body was shivering all over even though it wasn’t actually cold. Following on, an old man appeared above the Fu Clan in the sky.</p>
 <p>The old man had a body that resembled a dried up bone and looked just like a malicious devil. While he looked at the old man, Qing Shui felt as if the old man might die at anytime. However, there was a strange looking stone-like object in his body which appeared like it was supporting him.</p>
 <p>Stone of Life!</p>
 <p>With just one glance, Qing Shui was able to recognize the stone as he himself had worn one before. It was during that time when he got heavily injured by the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and was left with only one or two days to live. Back then, Di Chen let him wore a pendant made of a Stone of Life. It had managed to extend his lifespan by three years.</p>
 <p>It was also because of the Stone of Life which Di Chen gave that he was able to hang on and comprehend the Force of Rebirth, and endured until the moment when his body felt as if it got reborned. Now, he noticed that the old man was also wearing the Stone of Life. Furthermore, it seemed like its energy was already quite depleted. It shouldn’t be a problem for the Stone of Life to support the old man for up to a year and a half. However, these circumstances doesn’t seemed to make any influence to the tremendous death aura that emitted from the old man’s body.</p>
 <p>“Old Ancestor!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui predicted that the old man had ties with the Fu Clan, he never expected for him to be their Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the old man showed up, he didn’t actually made any moves. Ever since he showed up, he just looked at Qing Shui and didn’t even turn to look at the people from the Fu Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stayed on alert. At the same time, he also sensed the old man’s strength and immediately weakened it along with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. No matter who they were, he would only put a discussion after they became weakened. By doing this, if they were to really start a fight later, Qing Shui wouldn’t get too flustered by his opponents.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui was stunned because after the old man got weakened, he still had a strength worth more than 5,000 sun, and it was even close to 6,000 sun. This meant that before this, the old man had a strength worth nearly 9,000 sun. No wonder Qing Shui could feel danger.</p>
 <p>The Palace Lord of the Heaven Secrets Academy had mentioned before that the most powerful person from the Western Oxhe Continent had a strength of around 8,000 sun. Could it be that the ones that the old man had talked about was these people who were at the brink of death?</p>
 <p>The old man who looked like a malicious devil also stared at Qing Shui with a strange look. Even after he got weakened, he didn’t made his moves. He spoke slowly: “Your aura is bright like a river of stars. Why must you resort to extermination? Putting one Fu Clan aside, even if ten Fu Clans tried to stop you, they will fail to do so. Under this kind of circumstances, if you can choose to let go of the butcher knife in your hand, you will gain insights into the other aspects of life..”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old man. Prior to this, he actually wasn’t left with any way to step down. Additionally, killing them would also be quite a decent option although it was also fine even if he didn’t do it. It was very difficult for the Fu Clan to change their fate.</p>
 <p>“Just be straight with your words. How do you feel about fighting me after you finished speaking?” Qing Shui knew that the old man wouldn’t fight him. He was able to sense this really strongly.</p>
 <p>“I’m not going to let you beat me. In the future, you will definitely have boundless achievements. The Fu Clan will also not fail to appreciate your kindness. How about this? I’ll give you a few stuffs in exchange for the safety of these people from the Fu Clan. Let them leave this place and become an ordinary people with family. Does this sound fine to you?” The old man let out a sigh and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh, you want to trade something in exchange for their life?” Qing Shui asked even though he already knew the answer.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>“Sure, but first, I want to see what it is. I want to see if it’s worthy enough to convince me to let them go.” Qing Shui said indifferently.</p>
 <p>“This is easy. Take it.” The old man immediately threw an Interspatial Silk Sachet at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately peeked into it with his Spiritual Sense. The space within the Interspatial Silk Sachet was fairly small and was only one cubic meter in size. There were only a few stuff within it and the most obvious one was a piece of Yang Stone. Even though Qing Shui still had a few of it, but when it came to Yang Stone, he would never complain of himself having too many of them. After all, he was a blacksmith.</p>
 <p>There was also a Yang Stone Sword. Unfortunately, the level of forging for this sword was too rough. Despite this, there would still be a lot of people who would be fighting over it if he took it out. Hence, it was still considered really valuable. The last two things were two small porcelain bottles.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately scanned it. To his surprise, one of the bottles had Divine Beast’s Blood in it. The other bottle was slightly bigger and to his surprise yet again, there were two Ice Silkworm’s eggs inside. At the moment when Qing Shui was about to summon back his Spiritual Sense, he spotted an ordinary stone at the side. He was stunned upon examining the stone.</p>
 <p>Formation Eye Stone!</p>
 <p>When someone with said the stone set up formations, he or she could double the strength of the formation. As the Formation Eye Stone ascended in grade, the strength of the formation would also follow along and become stronger.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s eyes shone for a moment. All of these could be said to be extremely precious. Merely the value of the Formation Eye Stone was more than enough. It was just that there were too few people who was actually aware of the uses of these things.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you scared that I will kill all of you after I take away these stuff?” Qing Shui questioned the old man indifferently.</p>
 <p>“Well if that were to happen, I can only blame myself for being blind.” The old man didn’t express any emotions on his face. Since the beginning, he was already like this.</p>
 <p>“I can let them go. I hope that you will tell them what to do. You guys can decide whether to remain in the Heaven Secrets Academy or leave.” Qing Shui wasn’t worried that they would make any moves. Besides, he knew that at the end of the day, only very few of them would manage to remain alive.</p>
 <p>Even if he was to not take any action, other people would do it in his place.</p>
 <p>“We will leave. Don’t worry, my words is still quite reliable, even when I’m someone who is at the brink of death. Besides, they will never have the capability to seek vengeance from you. I will cripple a bit of the cultivation of the stronger ones among them.” The old man said calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected the old man to have this kind of thought. In a way, doing this could be considered to have helped the Fu Clan to keep their heritage. It was only by doing this would they be able to thoroughly eliminate the intentions to seek vengeance which some of them harbored. For someone at his age, the old man could have seen through almost everything. Compared to surviving, anything like love and vengeance were just like drifting clouds across the sky. They weren’t even worth mentioning about.</p>
 <p>Being alive was tough, so was surviving. Compared to keeping a clan alive, nothing could be more important. Only by staying alive would there be hope.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left and immediately went back to his own courtyard. Simultaneously, things regarding the Fu Clan had also started to spread around the entire academy very quickly. Now, the one who felt the most worried was none other than the Tian Clan and the clans who took part in the plan to kill Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>As for the Fu Clan, after they left very quickly on the same day, they had disappeared without leaving even a single trace. The higher-ups in the Heaven Secrets Academy also didn’t do anything about it. The old man in golden dragon gown had warned them about it way long ago and the few old demons also didn’t ask too many questions about the Heaven Secrets Academy. Things like this wouldn’t in the least bother them.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t because the Old Ancestor from the Fu Clan was nearing the end of his life, things might have turned out differently. The old man was aware that this young man was someone not to be taken lightly of. The Fu Clan had placed itself within the Heaven Secrets Academy. Compared to the academy, the colossus itself, the Fu Clan was still nothing. This young man would definitely be someone protected by the Heaven Secrets Academy. Even if he wanted to lay his hands on him, he wasn’t sure if he would or wouldn’t be able to do so. However, if he really would go toe-to-toe against Qing Shui now, he wouldn’t get even the slightest benefit out of it.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you alright?” Naturally, the Eldest Princess had also found out about the things regarding the Fu Clan.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine. I am going to first help you sweep away all the obstacles within the Heaven Secrets Academy. After that, I will help you how to organize the forces around the academy.” Qing Shui smiled and responded. The Heaven Secrets Academy was a lot simpler. With its support, he could do everything around here with relative ease.</p>
 <p>In the event of facing off against the Fu Clan, Qing Shui had demonstrated his strength. Three people with a strength worth 5,000 sun got eliminated by him in just a moment’s time. This war was enough to help him stand at an indisputable position within the Heaven Secrets Academy. In addition to that, he was a member of the Breezing Wind Veranda and most importantly, he also shared a deep relation with the support of the Breezing Wind Veranda, Yu Sunu.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so impetuous. Just act within your own competence.” The Eldest Princess slightly knitted her brows and said gently.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I don’t feel like dying yet. I am going to rest for a while.” Qing Shui went back to his room.</p>
 <p>Today, he no longer planned to go look for the Tian Clan and the other clans. He was waiting as this battle alone had already proved more than enough for him. He believed that one condition was all he needed to settle things. Hence, he right away entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>He started off by first taking out the Formation Eye Stone.</p>
 <p>This object was only the size of a palm and both of its ends looked sharp. The middle part of it was oval in shape. It somehow resembled a dart but compared to it, it was a bit huge. Upon touching it, Qing Shui felt that it was slightly cold but he wasn’t able to feel even the slightest spiritual fluctuation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly exerted force with his palm. At the moment, he wouldn’t need too much strength to crush normal metallic essence. However, this Formation Eye Stone was unusually tough. He wouldn’t try to hold it with too much force cause if it broke, the only thing he could do was cry.</p>
 <p>This thing didn’t need to go through the blood dropping ceremony as it could be refined immediately. What surprised Qing Shui was that the amount of Divine Force which the Formation Eye Stone could absorb was a lot. It seemed that this was a first grade Formation Eye Stone.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know if the Formation Eye Stone was a first grade or if it once had an owner, but he didn’t really care about this. In any case, he was really happy that the Formation Eye Stone could immediately increase the strength of the bearer’s formation by one time.</p>
 <p>After the refining process ended, Qing Shui immediately used the Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>Within the Nine Palace Steps, the Nine Palace can now also be considered as a trapping formation. The flow of time of everything within the area which it covered had became slower. Furthermore, the area in which it enveloped had also became bigger. The speed at which he moved, as well as his reaction speed, seemed to have increased significantly.</p>
 <p>It was as if he didn’t recognize fatigue, Qing Shui only stopped after a long time. While using the Nine Palace Steps, he also practiced his Taichi Fist, Back Connecting Fist, Tiger Form and so on. He realized that all of them had a strength which he was really satisfied with. Their actual ability to deal damage had to be a lot stronger than his own strength.</p>
 <p>At one spot within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, there was an enormous stone platform. On top of it were the Demon Binding Rope, Soulshake Bell, Spirit Gathering Lamp, Heaven Shaking Drum, Coiled Dragon Statue, Spirit Channeling Jade and so on. Of course, there was also the Formation Eye Stone.</p>
 <p>The Yang Stone and other forging materials were placed at another stone platform. The case for medicinal pills and herbs on the other hand, were isolated on top of a stone platform. The ingredients and alcohol were all organized neatly. All of these stone platform were near each other, but they weren’t stuck against one another. Furthermore, there were a few storeys of them.</p>
 <p>The function of the Formation Eye Stone was too significant. After all, Qing Shui knew a lot of formations and by then, the amount of potential which he could unleash would be even bigger. He thought of the time when his grade was still quite low. He wondered just how powerful it would get once he ascended in grade.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put the Yang Stone on the stone platform for forging materials. He even put the sword on there as he planned to reforge it again in the future when necessary.</p>
 <p>Only after that did he take out the Divine Beast Blood.</p>
 <p>There was only a few drops of it within the bottle as it came in a very small quantity. Each drops of it were the size of a thumb and was very thick as it gave out powerful energy fluctuation. When Qing Shui peeked at it with his Heavenly Vision Technique, it only said that it could be fed to beasts to strengthen some of their abilities.</p>
 <p>It was just that Qing Shui had the Crimson Pellet of the Nine-headed Moon Wolf’s core. That was also a Divine Beast from legend. It could strengthen the powerful innate skills of demonic beasts, and would have even greater effect especially to wolf type demonic beasts and demonic beasts with more than one head. The strength which the pellet could increase right away was also quite decent. At the present, it might seem like the amount which it could increase was fairly little but to him at that time, it was already quite a significant amount. Even for magic potions owned by warriors, if a normal person was to eat it, even if their body didn’t burst, there would still be a limit to which their strength could increase. Only by getting stronger could one make use of its effects to its maximum potential.</p>
 <p>How was the effect of this Divine Beast Blood when compared to the Crimson Pellet of the Nine-headed Moon Wolf’s Core?</p>
