  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 380 - Helpless, Heart-broken Mingyue Gelou </strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">This is the strength of One with Heaven!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All this time, Qing Shui has never treated Taichi Fist as a technique against opponents, but as a technique to strengthen and build his body. Most importantly, Qing Shui was able to increase the “Nature Energy” in his body through the cultivation of Taichi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would never give up on Nature Energy since he was able to cultivate one of the strongest “Qi” in Heaven and Earth. Moreover, he was able to learn the benefits of Nature Energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking back, he noticed that he had begun cultivating Taichi with a leisure and carefree attitude. Even his breakthroughs were never intentional.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was funny to Qing Shui, as well as annoying, that this technique had been the first to reach the realm of “One with Heaven”!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui exited from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, it was already daytime.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he arrived at the courtyard, the third generations of the Qing Clan, including Qing He, were all there. He looked at the familiar grounds of the courtyard and happened to meet Mingyue Gelou’s gaze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou looked away shyly. While Qing Shui was moved from her gestures, he found it funny at the same time. He thought about how passionate she was last night, especially when she had straddled on top of Qing Shui; the flirtatious expression of her waist rocking about was swaying.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was only able to train a round of Taichi Fist today. The advancement of the realm made Qing Shui feel like he was becoming one with Heaven and Earth. Every move felt like an art, but at the same time, they were simple and lively.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he was just finishing his moves, the little kid rubbed her eyes while walking out barefooted. When she saw Qing Shui, she pouted: “Bad daddy, you didn’t wake me up from bed.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like he needed to say nice things to her. She was the one who slept together with Mingyue Gelou, yet she didn’t complain to Mingyue Gelou. Instead, she came to blame him. Qing Shui felt delighted and warm by the angry girl.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Whomever the children threw their tantrums to were ones they felt very dear to. That was what made Qing Shui very happy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui willfully gave directions to the training of Qing Clan’s third generation!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Not long after everyone had breakfast, Qing Shui could hear sounds from outside before they had a chance to wind down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue Gelou, come out!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou, who was just helping Qing Yi tidy up the bowls and utensils, suddenly dropped the bowl she was holding upon hearing those words!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Smash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were broken into pieces!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the pale-faced Mingyue Gelou and he could tell that she knew this person. But who is she terribly afraid of, and why was she so easily afraid despite the fact that Qing Shui was here?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou was even trembling uncontrollably!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui understood. He was able to guess who it could possibly be!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, don’t be afraid. Everyone is here for you.” Qing Yi quickly consoled Mingyue Gelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will go down and look!” Qing Shui stood up as he said that. The others stood up at the same time as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, You and me….. Let’s go together.” Mingyue Gelou said, as if she had made a strong determination. A thought constantly flashed by through her head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!” Qing Shui smiled as he replied to Mingyue Gelou!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui and the others from the Qing Clan came out, there were about ten people standing in the courtyard. The leader of the group was a handsome young man who looked to be about 30 years old.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man has a faint smile on his face. However, his lips were meager, giving off a mean and heartless demeanor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tan Yang, we no longer have relations with each other. What do you want with me?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took back his gaze as Mingyue Gelou asked the young man. Then, he understood that this man was actually Mingyue Gelou’s husband.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this point, Qing Shui felt a bit uncomfortable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of people from the Qing Clan looked at the young man and ten elder beside him with indifference, but no one could say a word about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No relation to me... As long as I’m alive, you, Mingyue Gelou, are my, Tan Yang’s, woman.” The young man said fiercely while staring at Mingyue Gelou. There were no emotions in his eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If I wanted you dead, you would be dead right now!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s voice came towering down!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang shifted his gaze towards Qing Shui. There was an unspeakable hatred in his tone: “Qing Shui, is it. I will just tell you today, the woman beside you, she is the lawful wife of mine. Could it be that you want to steal my woman away.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he finished his sentence, his face showed a ruthless, savory smile. Then, he looked at Mingyue Gelou. When she met his eyes, she quickly shifted and hide. She didn’t dare meet eye to eye with Tan Yang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We no longer have any relations with each other ever since I left that day.” Mingyue Gelou gritted her teeth as she spoke</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Give me back my daughter. Then, I will agree to you leaving me. Otherwise, you can come back with me together with our daughter.” Tan Yang said calmly. However, there was an indescribable determination in his tone, because he knew if he wanted to take the child away, Mingyue Gelou would have to obey his wishes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This action made Qing Shui reminisce about the time when his mother said something similar to what had just been said….. For a moment, Qing Shui felt heartbroken.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What if she doesn’t follow you back?” Qing Shui said in a serious tone as he frowned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I know you are part of the Heavenly Palace. More importantly, you are the youngest Elder of the Heavenly Palace. But I am also part of the Sword Tower. Do you wish to provoke hostility again between Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang stared at Qing Shui with keen eyes; there was an unspeakable arrogance in his tone!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was jolted by Tan Yang’s pressure. Before he consumed the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core and Greencloud Up-step Pellet, he couldn’t tell who is stronger or weaker. But now, to Qing Shui, Tan Yang was merely a piece of trash.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had fought with the 9th Tower Disciples from the Sword Tower before. Did that mean the ones who went to the Heavenly Palace were not their strongest disciples? Qing Shui felt that the problem was getting serious. This time, it was obvious that they were targeting him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could it be that the Sword Tower wanted to redeem themselves through this man called Tan Yang? It seemed that the Sword Tower thought highly of Tan Yang. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to represent the whole Sword Tower by himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No matter what, Sword Tower and Heavenly Palace were sects of the same grade. Qing Shui couldn’t help but glance at the four elders behind the young man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were two Peak-level 8th Grade Martial Kings. All of them were of the same grade as the elder from before. The other two elders must be tenth Grade Martial Kings, which was greater than the previous Peak-level 8th Grade Martial Kings. It seemed that Tan Yang was really of great importance to Sword Tower. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The difference between a tenth Grade Martial King and the Peak Martial King was the difference between Heaven and Earth.. The effort needed to go from tenth Grade Martial King to peak Martial King would require a vast amount of accumulated energy. Even ten tenth Grade Martial Kings could not defeat one peak-level Martial King. This was the unique strength of the different peak grades.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Whatever it is, he was not wrong to keep Mingyue Gelou by his side. But since her husband had come for her now, he should let her go back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clearly knew that he couldn’t reason with the situation any longer. The other party was also from the background of a big sect just like himself. Moreover, Tan Yang also had stronger martial warriors with him as well…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou looked at the frowning Qing Shui. Her eyes were filled with tears, but she forcefully held back. She lifted up her head towards the young man and said: “I will go with you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a pang in his heart. He extended his arm and grabbed Mingyue Gelou’s hand: “Mingyue, you don’t have to go. As long as I am here, I won’t let anyone take you away.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let go of my woman. Otherwise, don’t blame me if I wipe away your entire Qing Clan.” The young man narrowed his eyes, his murderous intent coldly forcing its way towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let me go. Gelou will remember the good deeds you have done for us both. Don’t be hasty. You still have other important things to do. Don’t be stubborn, I know you feel very uncomfortable, but there are times in life when you feel helpless. Not everyone gets what they want. This is my life, there is no need to be forceful.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou slowly pulled herself away from Qing Shui’s grip. She said those words with a soft tone and a smile!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could tell she was faking her expression by her apathetic tone. He could also tell that Mingyue Gelou feared him from the first moment Tan Yang had spoken to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will challenge you. Whoever loses will leave Mingyue.” Qing Shui said loudly to Tan Yang. His eyes are now totally bloodshot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not endure any longer!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Challenge? There will be a day for that, but today, I will not accept your challenge. Why should I bet my woman for you?” Tan Yang became even more arrogant when he saw Qing Shui’s bloodshot eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“State your conditions, I will accept.” Qing Shui gripped his hands together as he looked at Tan Yang. He wanted Tan Yang to accept his challenge. That way, everything in front of him will be solved easily after killing him in the battle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Not interested!” Tan Yang said with a straightforward tone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grab the child, let’s go back!” Tan Yang said to Mingyue Gelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crunched his fists, his blood is dripping from his palm! The blood dripped and splattered on the ground!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I won’t go, I won’t go, I want to be with daddy…...” Little Yu Chang shouted as she cried. Her face was filled with tears.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s whole body was shaking. How could he endure such things as a man. Even Death could not endure it, how could Qing Shui? He stomped on the ground and rushed towards Tan Yang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Swoosh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you move one more step, I will cut my throat!” Mingyue Gelou said softly as she blocked Qing Shui from moving forward.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, thank for for saving the little lass that time. I can never pay you back the debt I owe you. In life, all good things must come to an end. Our fate ends here. We won’t be happy even if we try to force it. You are a clever man, don’t do things you will regret later on.” Mingyue Gelou teared uncontrollably.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue… I am useless….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t say that. Don’t be sad. You are a man who will achieve great things in life, so you won’t suffer in the future. But now, you still need to endure all of this. You are a reasonable man, Qing Shui. Be patient, be patient…. Treat yourself well, I don’t regret, I won’t regret what we had with each other forever….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou’s tears flow down like a stream on her porcelain cheeks….. “Qing Shui, he won’t dare to touch me. I, Mingyue Gelou, am your woman. I will forever be your woman. I will not let anyone else touch me except you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked blankly at the beautiful woman blocking him. The woman who had been very passionate with him last night, the reasonable and sensible woman, she would always think for other people, except herself.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a remnant of unbearable sadness in those beautiful eyes. A bloodstain streamed out from the corners of Qing Shui’s mouth….&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“I will go down and look!” Qing Shui stood up as he said that. The others stood up at the same time as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, You and me….. Let’s go together.” Mingyue Gelou said, as if she had made a strong determination. A thought constantly flashed by through her head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!” Qing Shui smiled as he replied to Mingyue Gelou!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui and the others from the Qing Clan came out, there were about ten people standing in the courtyard. The leader of the group was a handsome young man who looked to be about 30 years old.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man has a faint smile on his face. However, his lips were meager, giving off a mean and heartless demeanor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tan Yang, we no longer have relations with each other. What do you want with me?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took back his gaze as Mingyue Gelou asked the young man. Then, he understood that this man was actually Mingyue Gelou’s husband.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this point, Qing Shui felt a bit uncomfortable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A lot of people from the Qing Clan looked at the young man and ten elder beside him with indifference, but no one could say a word about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No relation to me... As long as I’m alive, you, Mingyue Gelou, are my, Tan Yang’s, woman.” The young man said fiercely while staring at Mingyue Gelou. There were no emotions in his eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If I wanted you dead, you would be dead right now!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s voice came towering down!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang shifted his gaze towards Qing Shui. There was an unspeakable hatred in his tone: “Qing Shui, is it. I will just tell you today, the woman beside you, she is the lawful wife of mine. Could it be that you want to steal my woman away.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he finished his sentence, his face showed a ruthless, savory smile. Then, he looked at Mingyue Gelou. When she met his eyes, she quickly shifted and hide. She didn’t dare meet eye to eye with Tan Yang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We no longer have any relations with each other ever since I left that day.” Mingyue Gelou gritted her teeth as she spoke</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Give me back my daughter. Then, I will agree to you leaving me. Otherwise, you can come back with me together with our daughter.” Tan Yang said calmly. However, there was an indescribable determination in his tone, because he knew if he wanted to take the child away, Mingyue Gelou would have to obey his wishes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This action made Qing Shui reminisce about the time when his mother said something similar to what had just been said….. For a moment, Qing Shui felt heartbroken.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What if she doesn’t follow you back?” Qing Shui said in a serious tone as he frowned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I know you are part of the Heavenly Palace. More importantly, you are the youngest Elder of the Heavenly Palace. But I am also part of the Sword Tower. Do you wish to provoke hostility again between Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang stared at Qing Shui with keen eyes; there was an unspeakable arrogance in his tone!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was jolted by Tan Yang’s pressure. Before he consumed the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core and Greencloud Up-step Pellet, he couldn’t tell who is stronger or weaker. But now, to Qing Shui, Tan Yang was merely a piece of trash.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had fought with the 9th Tower Disciples from the Sword Tower before. Did that mean the ones who went to the Heavenly Palace were not their strongest disciples? Qing Shui felt that the problem was getting serious. This time, it was obvious that they were targeting him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Could it be that the Sword Tower wanted to redeem themselves through this man called Tan Yang? It seemed that the Sword Tower thought highly of Tan Yang. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to represent the whole Sword Tower by himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No matter what, Sword Tower and Heavenly Palace were sects of the same grade. Qing Shui couldn’t help but glance at the four elders behind the young man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were two Peak-level 8th Grade Martial Kings. All of them were of the same grade as the elder from before. The other two elders must be tenth Grade Martial Kings, which was greater than the previous Peak-level 8th Grade Martial Kings. It seemed that Tan Yang was really of great importance to Sword Tower. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The difference between a tenth Grade Martial King and the Peak Martial King was the difference between Heaven and Earth.. The effort needed to go from tenth Grade Martial King to peak Martial King would require a vast amount of accumulated energy. Even ten tenth Grade Martial Kings could not defeat one peak-level Martial King. This was the unique strength of the different peak grades.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Whatever it is, he was not wrong to keep Mingyue Gelou by his side. But since her husband had come for her now, he should let her go back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clearly knew that he couldn’t reason with the situation any longer. The other party was also from the background of a big sect just like himself. Moreover, Tan Yang also had stronger martial warriors with him as well…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou looked at the frowning Qing Shui. Her eyes were filled with tears, but she forcefully held back. She lifted up her head towards the young man and said: “I will go with you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a pang in his heart. He extended his arm and grabbed Mingyue Gelou’s hand: “Mingyue, you don’t have to go. As long as I am here, I won’t let anyone take you away.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let go of my woman. Otherwise, don’t blame me if I wipe away your entire Qing Clan.” The young man narrowed his eyes, his murderous intent coldly forcing its way towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let me go. Gelou will remember the good deeds you have done for us both. Don’t be hasty. You still have other important things to do. Don’t be stubborn, I know you feel very uncomfortable, but there are times in life when you feel helpless. Not everyone gets what they want. This is my life, there is no need to be forceful.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou slowly pulled herself away from Qing Shui’s grip. She said those words with a soft tone and a smile!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could tell she was faking her expression by her apathetic tone. He could also tell that Mingyue Gelou feared him from the first moment Tan Yang had spoken to her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will challenge you. Whoever loses will leave Mingyue.” Qing Shui said loudly to Tan Yang. His eyes are now totally bloodshot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not endure any longer!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Challenge? There will be a day for that, but today, I will not accept your challenge. Why should I bet my woman for you?” Tan Yang became even more arrogant when he saw Qing Shui’s bloodshot eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“State your conditions, I will accept.” Qing Shui gripped his hands together as he looked at Tan Yang. He wanted Tan Yang to accept his challenge. That way, everything in front of him will be solved easily after killing him in the battle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Not interested!” Tan Yang said with a straightforward tone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grab the child, let’s go back!” Tan Yang said to Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crunched his fists, his blood is dripping from his palm! The blood dripped and splattered on the ground!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I won’t go, I won’t go, I want to be with daddy…...” Little Yu Chang shouted as she cried. Her face was filled with tears.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s whole body was shaking. How could he endure such things as a man. Even Death could not endure it, how could Qing Shui? He stomped on the ground and rushed towards Tan Yang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Swoosh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you move one more step, I will cut my throat!” Mingyue Gelou said softly as she blocked Qing Shui from moving forward.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, thank for for saving the little lass that time. I can never pay you back the debt I owe you. In life, all good things must come to an end. Our fate ends here. We won’t be happy even if we try to force it. You are a clever man, don’t do things you will regret later on.” Mingyue Gelou teared uncontrollably.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue… I am useless….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t say that. Don’t be sad. You are a man who will achieve great things in life, so you won’t suffer in the future. But now, you still need to endure all of this. You are a reasonable man, Qing Shui. Be patient, be patient…. Treat yourself well, I don’t regret, I won’t regret what we had with each other forever….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou’s tears flow down like a stream on her porcelain cheeks….. “Qing Shui, he won’t dare to touch me. I, Mingyue Gelou, am your woman. I will forever be your woman. I will not let anyone else touch me except you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked blankly at the beautiful woman blocking him. The woman who had been very passionate with him last night, the reasonable and sensible woman, she would always think for other people, except herself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a remnant of unbearable sadness in those beautiful eyes. A bloodstain streamed out from the corners of Qing Shui’s mouth….&nbsp;</p>
