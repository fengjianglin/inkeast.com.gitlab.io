 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t expect that Man Jing would have the Divine Square Cauldron. This item was the most precious to Qing Shui at the moment and it was also something which he had desired the most. If his Flying Sword Divine Weapon could be upgraded by a few levels, his abilities would rise significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had defeated Bei Huangyu, he knew that he had just entered that circle and his strength was at the very bottom. After all, he had some techniques and abilities which he needed time to perform. If he wasn't given the chance to do so, he could do nothing but be killed instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui placed the Divine Square Cauldrons into the Treasure Basin, planning to use them to upgrade the Flying Sword after their quality had been improved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was in a very good mood. The Rainflower Pavilion's Pavilion Mistress had even said that she would keep a lookout for the Divine Square Cauldrons and she would further thank him after she had gotten a child. However, Qing Shui had already decided that the two Divine Square Cauldrons from earlier was sufficient for the medical fees. If there were more Divine Square Cauldrons in the future, he wouldn't refuse them nor would he let them lose out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are those little cauldrons very useful to you?" Nuo Lan sat opposite Qing Shui and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, they are. I have a technique which requires me to deplete these things." Qing Shui didn’t tell the whole truth, but it wasn't exactly a lie neither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I see. I'll help you find more of them. I remember one of my friend having it in the past. It looked the same. She only kept it because she thought that it looked nice." Nuo Lan recalled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Can you help me ask your friend then? I'm willing to have a trade with her. I should have many things that she should be interested in." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry. It'll be fine with me around, assuming it's still around. You'll still have to thank me after this." Nuo Lan smiled and looked at Qing Shui. She felt that this young man was getting more and more mysterious and it seemed that his medical skills were too heaven-defying as well. The same went for his alchemy and cooking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What else could she do? She knew that it wasn't a good thing to be overly curious about a man, but there were situations where one wouldn't be able to pull away despite knowing this logic. She was able to stop herself from prying too much, but there was no way that she could stop the curiosity that was growing in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How do you want me to thank you? Why don't I gift myself to you?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That'd be nice, but I can't afford to accept it." Nuo Lan said a little dejectedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui found it really funny. He hadn't expected that Nuo Lan could say something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, I've gotten some news. Are you interested to hear about it?" Nuo Lan suddenly said. There seemed to be hope flickering in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What news is that? Is it so good that it can light up your eyes like this?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"A treasure beast has appeared in Redcloud Valley. Are you interested?" Nuo Lan didn't make things clear. She clearly wanted to let Qing Shui ask her questions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? Treasure beast? What kind of treasure beast?" Qing Shui's interest was piqued. The Dragon Slaying Beast was an evolved form of a treasure beast and of course, he would be very interested in them. Such heavenly and earthly treasures were extremely rare and since he had encountered them, he would have to go and try out his luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"An Advancing Divine Worm!" Nuo Lan's eyes gleamed as she said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What is it? What uses does it have?" Qing Shui hadn't heard of the Advancing Divine Worm before and although he wouldn't underestimate worms, he didn't think well of them either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Their usage is very simple. They can be engulfed by demonic beasts, allowing the demonic beasts to evolve into a new grade. Their aptitude would increase by a notch, although the actual amount of increment is unknown. At the very least, their overall strength would double." Nuo Lan said with great yearning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's interest was piqued. This thing was definitely considered to be a great treasure. His demonic beasts would need them. For example, the Demonic Dragon Spider, Long Zhu`er, Dark Phoenix, and Little Rin needed them. Even if he were to raise the grade for the weakest one, the double in strength would still be very useful. Moreover, this thing had a decisive effect in increasing demonic beasts' aptitude thereafter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How many Advancing Divine Worms are there? Are they big? Are they strong?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Advancing Divine Worms are considered to be in the greatest numbers amongst the treasure beasts. Some people actually don't fancy it as it only has an effect on demonic beasts with a strength that's below 20 billion Dao force. It's considered to be quite a good medicinal herb amongst the heavenly and earthly treasures, but when it appears, there would often be at least three of them and not more than eight. Their sizes are that of a cow and they aren't strong, but they can dig holes and it isn't easy to catch them. Most importantly, there are a lot of people after them and there would be many people fighting for and snatching them." Nuo Lan explained briefly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now had a general understanding. Treasure beasts tend not to be strong, but their abilities to escape and protect themselves were what made them tough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now had a great interest in the Advancing Divine Worms. He decided to make a trip to check them out and get his hands on a few of them to make his demonic beasts stronger. By then, he should be able to stand his ground, even if he was only relying on the few demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's go try our luck. They might just end up belonging to us." Qing Shui said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll be satisfied with just having one to give to my little fox." Nuo Lan's eyes had narrowed into a crescent slit, appearing extremely seductive. Qing Shui could not help but think that she was a great demoness whose seduction was greater than even Qing Hanye's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Hanye had the Nine Yin Body and a pair of beautiful eyes, the martial technique she had cultivated wasn't one that charmed others. It was different for Nuo Lan, whose physique was the most seductive Immortal Fox Physique and she even cultivated the most seductive martial technique. Thankfully, Qing Shui had good self-control and both his Heavenly Vision Technique and Yin-Yang Image had a mind-clearing effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? When are we going to set off?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's set off now. Someone came across an Advancing Divine Worm yesterday and I reckon that everyone's headed over there right now." Nuo Lan started to feel anxious upon saying this. If they were to set off late and others were to get their hands on the Advancing Divine Worms because of that, she would be very upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things were on the right track and Qing Shui didn't need to be constantly here. Anyway, the people who came would take queue numbers and Qing Shui would inform them to come forth when he was free. After all, treatments of terminal diseases came with unclear payments requests. Therefore, he was usually not busy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After cleaning up the place briefly and informing the others, Qing Shui left together with Nuo Lan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Redcloud Valley was situated between the Northern Emperor Domain and the Northern King Domain. Therefore, Qing Shui had to be very careful this time around. After all, it wasn't such that only people from the Northern Emperor Domain would go. People from the Northern King Domain would be going as well. Other than these people, he wasn't sure if people from other places would also be going.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the surface, it appeared as if the Northern Emperor Domain's Northern Emperor Domain was the strongest city, with the strongest Divine Palace and Taiyi Immortal Palace. However, other than the Northern Emperor Domain, there were many other cities and it was unknown what kind of powerful experts and other existences had kept themselves concealed. After all, not all powerful influences were willing to head to the Northern Emperor Domain.</span></p>
