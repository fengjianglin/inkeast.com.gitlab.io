 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She slowly walked towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her figure was extremely alluring with all the curves in the right places. The contours of her body were exquisite and her pair of delicate snow-white legs were like those of an immortal maiden walking through the world, exuding a charm that could stir the soul of those who saw them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her long hair draped over her shoulders, and her flowery eyes, straight nose, and cherry-like mouth truly made her an object of beauty that would mesmerise countless people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui was completely stunned. He never would have imagined that the Great Palace Master would actually be her. This woman had a Nine Yin physique and only now did he realize that he had never forgotten her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui recalled that some time ago, he had still thought of her, but never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined that even without returning to the Greencloud Continent, he would meet her again over here. Although he still couldn’t be 100% sure that she was the Great Palace Master of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace, he felt very confident in his guess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last he saw her was already decades ago, roughly thirty years if he recalled correctly. The passing of the years showed no signs on her beautiful face but she now had a more mature beauty compared to the past, and her demeanor was even more mesmerizing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her charm wasn’t in any way inferior to Huoyun Liu-li. Huoyun Liu-li had the charm of a little woman, but Qing Hanye’s charm leaned towards the imposing side. Ordinary maidens would have no way of being compared to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing her, Qing Shui thought back to the ‘familiar scenes’ that happened in their dreams. The scene now seemed to have reverted to the time back then...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Qing Hanye who was in the dream stood stark naked before him. Qing Shui simply stared at her perfect body, her snow-white skin, and shapely breasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her flat stomach and the most exemplary willowy waist linked to a curvy and perky ass. Her jade legs were long and slender, and with no clothes covering it, they were mesmerizing to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment, Qing Shui’s clothes were all removed as well. His frame was packed with muscles, but it was not the unsightly type. The Ancient Strengthening Technique he practiced was able to refine his bones, tendons, meridians, and flesh. Right now, his perfect muscled frame even shone with the light of perfection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye pulled Qing Shui to the bed. The two of them laid down there and stared into each other eyes in this space of dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s fiery lust had already reached its peak, to the extent where he felt the flames of his own lust burning him. The nameless art he practiced, in addition to the Ancient Strengthening Technique, frenziedly circulated energy within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui finally moved. He embraced her and both his hands started roaming around her soft and elastic skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then buried his head and motorboated her, kissing and suckling on the pink tips of her snowy peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, who was in the ‘dream’, moved. After that, Qing Hanye felt a sense of relaxation, as a comfortable warmth began to circulate around her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ………………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye then flipped her body around and pressed down on Qing Shui, straddling his hips… This beautiful vision and the sense of their bodies pressing together gave Qing Shui the knowledge of what it meant to have a taste of paradise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That smile, as well as her misty eyes, her slightly parted mouth, the delicate and soft feel of her body, and her lustful moans that lightly sounded out…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feeling in the ‘dream’ was extremely realistic. The two of them complemented each other perfectly, and seemed to be connected via telepathy. She would mirror each of Qing Shui’s moves flawlessly at the slightest motion of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was especially so when Qing Hanye knelt down on the bed. Her beautiful eyes flashed with a hint of shyness. She then lifted her beautiful ass up high as her moist cavern exuded a sense of welcome, waiting for Qing Shui to penetrate her…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">………….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui woke up from his daze, he realised Qing Hanye was already before him. He didn’t think that he would have such a vivid imagination and right now, facing Qing Hanye, his expression was somewhat unnatural.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui awkwardly stared at her. Although nothing had happened in reality between them, Qing Shui knew that Qing Hanye was in love with him in the past, but things didn’t really work out for one reason or another. He just didn’t imagine that he would see her once again in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were simply no end to wonders in the world. To think that Qing Hanye would actually be the Great Palace Master of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. This made him extremely curious and only after a long time did he greet her, “How are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m okay, what about you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice was filled with magnetism, and it was somewhat on the low side. However, those who heard the sound of her voice would feel their souls stirring. It was as though her voice contained some magical power. Right now, Qing Shui noticed that Qing Hanye was looking at him so fixedly that she didn’t even blink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Palace Master, to think that we would actually meet in such a situation.” Qing Shui shook his head and spoke in a somewhat helpless tone of voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I also didn’t expect it. I feel very happy. The fate you spoke of is truly a mysterious and wonderful thing.” Qing Hanye shifted her gaze to the surroundings as she slowly spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also discovered that she was now much more independent compared to the past. Standing there, she was as charming as ever and she also exuded a sense of indescribable beauty and sexiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is your grandfather still well?” Qing Shui casually asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye’s expression involuntarily turned grim for a moment before she lightly shook her head, “He’s no longer around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he heard this, Qing Shui felt sorrow in his heart. Staring at Qing Hanye, back then this woman and her grandpa lived together. Her grandpa was none other than the great elder of the Immortal Sword Sect, eventually becoming the sect leader in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could guess even without thinking that it should most probably be because of her grandpa’s death that she chose to leave, which was how they could meet here again today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorry? Don’t be sad for things that have already happened in the past. Your grandfather would want you to live happily too.” Qing Shui didn’t know how to console her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It has already been many years. If grandpa were still alive, he would surely be very joyful with my current accomplishments.” Qing Hanye’s countenance returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m very curious. How did you become the Great Palace Master of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
