 <p><strong>AST 739 - A Risky Kill, Four Folds of Offensive Strength</strong></p>
 <p>Including Zuoshi Yun, there were seven people left in the distance. Each and every one of them looked really pale. Other than Zuoshi Yun, the other six people were slowly surrounding Qing Shui. Unfortunately, they were all filled with anxiety.</p>
 <p>The way things turned out had totally exceeded their expectations. Anyone knew that once a person achieved great rank, all his friends family would share their fame. The young man in front of them, he was someone who was about to attain that.</p>
 <p>“It’d have been great if he is someone from Zuoshi Clan.” Zuoshi Ziyan looked at Qing Shui before moving on to look at the pale Zuoshi Yun. When compared to him, the geniuses from Zuoshi Clan weren’t worth even a pair of sandals.</p>
 <p>Weaken, weaken…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui weakened all six of the people that were charging towards him in a row. The remaining people all had abilities that were worth around two stars, so when they got further weakened by him, their abilities became worth less than a star and a half.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Fire Bird and instantly went into the state of the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens. He breathed out an intense black flame and made both the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant charge towards them, one from above, the other bellow.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Hell’s Inferno!</p>
 <p>The Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly and Jade Emperor Queen Bee were also summoned out by him. But he made them hang on to either the Fire Bird or the Diamond Gigantic Elephant as they continuously initiated their unique attacks at the people from Zhuoshi Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, faced off against Zuoshi Ziyan. The odds of the fight were slowly tipping towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Did you regret it?” Qing Shui once again clashed against Zuoshi Ziyan’s. The effect of damage increase once again emerged and he right away pushed back his opponent. In between, Qing Shui continuously peppered Zuoshi Ziyan with his Hidden Weapons. Even the people who were fighting in the distance got hurt by them. Or else, the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant would not be able to hold their ground against them.</p>
 <p>If the enemies drew closer, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would use the Mighty Elephant Stomp.</p>
 <p>At the beginning, one of the old men from Zuoshi Clan rapidly made his way to the front but very unfortunately, he got petrified by the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly and immediately got torn apart by the Mighty Elephant Stomp of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>This instilled a kind of fear in the other five people, causing them to not dare to get too close to Qing Shui. Qing Shui would also shoot out a Hidden Weapon with poison from time to time, making him impossible to defend against. Once it hit the target, the fate that awaited the target would only be death.</p>
 <p>“Zuoshi Ao, tell me, do you think we will die today?” One of the old men asked.</p>
 <p>For people from Zuoshi Clan, even if it had been a guard looking after the gate, he would be looked up upon by other people. No matter where they went, they would be respected by other people. Who would have expected a day to come where they were pushed back like this? Furthermore, it was because of a young man.</p>
 <p>“Zuoshi Yanlang, don't ask questions like this. I'm feeling really nervous deep down. I haven't lived long enough to die.” The old man said while letting out a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Let's finish of these two Demonic beasts first, I refuse to die under the feet of these two Demonic beasts.”</p>
 <p>“You two go from the back, you go from the left while the two of us attack it from the front.” Zhuoshi Ao looked at both the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant and ordered the other four men.</p>
 <p>“Alright!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waited until this moment to use the most powerful supplementary technique. The Art of Pursuing caused Zhuoshi Ziyan’s speed to drop down.</p>
 <p>Binding Talisman!</p>
 <p>Binding Talisman!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would take some time to throw out the Binding Talisman. He was waiting for the right moment to kill the elderly men. There were only two methods to do so, it's either he kill them with poison or kill them by force.</p>
 <p>Even though poisons were reliable, his opponent was holding the powerful Thunderbolt at the moment. Hence, it would be very difficult for his Hidden Weapons to work. The Shadowless Needle could only be used at short range and it also needed time to reload. However, this time was already enough for the enemies to kill him a few times.</p>
 <p>As for the Frosted Iron Balls, the enemy could block it with his long weapons. Even the Primordial Flames could also be blocked by the opponent. Hence, he could only counter his opponent with force if he wanted to kill him. But now, Qing Shui would only pose a threat to his enemy if he was under the effect of Damage Increase. If he really wanted to kill his enemy, he would need to increase his offensive strength significantly for one more time.</p>
 <p>On their next clash, Qing Shui used a technique which he had never used before.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, it could only cause a bit of damage to the enemy.</p>
 <p>But more often, Qing Shui would be blown backwards by Zuoshi Ziyan. His body had already long been stained by the blood which flowed out from the corner of his mouth. It was just that the more they clashed, the more confident he looked.</p>
 <p>This was also one of the things that motivated the people from Zhuoshi Clan to continue battling.</p>
 <p>“Young man, you only managed to push me back once. Even though your body was really tough, you still lacked in offensive strength. What's the point in holding on? Let me help end your pain.” Zuoshi Ziyan said as he pushed back Qing Shui once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Actually, he was also feeling a bit helpless now. But Qing Shui had lefthimself a path of retreat. Once the effect of the Skywolf Crystal Card disappeared, he would leave. The worst outcome was just for him to put away the Demonic Beasts and escape with Nine Continents Steps Effect.</p>
 <p>The effect of the crystal card could still last for about seven minutes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was waiting for the right moment. If he managed to make it in time, he would be able to end the fight today. Qing Shui felt the familiar strength emerging and spreading out around his body.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>He left a small wound on Zuoshi Ziyan’s body. At the moment, Qing Shui was holding a hammer in his left hand and the Big Dipper Sword in the other. After all, the knowledge contained in was a bit more profound.</p>
 <p>The Combination Sword Technique could also help raise a bit of offensive strength.</p>
 <p>The more they clashed, the more frustrated Zuoshi Ziyan felt. Despite having blood stains all over his body, the young man in front of him just wouldn’t fall. From time to time, he would even use attacks which could injure him. His body was terrifyingly powerful, with a terrifying recovery ability. If it had been other people, they would have long since been dead.</p>
 <p>“Today, only you guys can die.” Qing Shui rubbed off the blood on the corner of his mouth and smiled at Zhuoshi Ziyan.</p>
 <p>The familiar force once again emerged. Coincidentally, Zuoshi Ziyan struck towards him furiously with his attack. The halo on top of the Thunderbolt flashed with a weird light. Qing Shui on the other hand, he locked his sight on the chest of his enemy.</p>
 <p>A series of explosive noises rang up in the air.</p>
 <p>“I’ll risk it once!” The blood in Qing Shui’s body felt as if it has started burning because there was only a few breaths of time left.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant while approaching the enemy’s Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Minute Subtlety all the way to its limit. The Thunderbolt Spear pierced through him at the corner of his chest. Qing Shui on the other hand, pierced through his enemy's chest with his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, he actually managed to penetrate through his body with one thrust.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. After that, he came to realize that the Damage Increase effect of the Four-Eared Shadow Mouse Crystal Card has merged with the unique effect of Critical Damage and immediately caused an attack that was four times as strong. He managed to penetrate through Zhuoshi Ziyan’s chest with only one strike.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui also got stabbed by the spear, he reduced the damage to its minimum. The two stabbed each other almost at the same time. Qing Shui was paralyzed but at this moment, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant managed to make it in time with its Mighty Elephant Stomp. After the Fire Bird got Qing Shui, it immediately retreated backwards and forcefully pulled Qing Shui off of the spear. Qing Shui’s blood spilled out.</p>
 <p>This was also something that Qing Shui prepared in advance. If he didn't do so and his enemy didn’t get a fatal wound, Qing Shui would only be killed by the enemy’s Thunderbolt. This was all to protect his life.</p>
 <p>But Qing Shui could only withstand that pain. He believed that the spear had twisted roots and intertwined joints. The injuries that he sustained were a few times more severe than what they looked like. However, he managed to stay alive. As long as Qing Shui could stay alive, he would be able to recover and heal himself.</p>
 <p>It's worth it!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had blood all over his body but he still let out a happy smile. The death of this old man meant the elimination of Zuoshi Clan. He took out a piece of Golden Buddha Aura Lotus and swallowed it.</p>
 <p>His damaged body recovered at a speed which was visible to the eye. The people on the opposite side were stunned as they stared at Zuoshi Ziyan who was barely standing in mid-air.</p>
 <p>The long spear dropped down!</p>
 <p>“Old Ancestor!”</p>
 <p>“Old Ancestor!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Ziyan was on the verge of collapsing. As he looked at the remaining Zuoshi Clan’s clan members, he had a lot of mixed and complicated feelings. He once again moved his gaze to Zuoshi Yun.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Yun on the other hand, had a face that looked as pale as a paper. He didn't have the guts to even look at Zuoshi Ziyan.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zuoshi Ziyan let out a long sigh and once again glanced at them. It was a glance filled with disappointment and reluctance to leave. It was uncertain if he was disappointed with himself or with the others. After that, he slowly closed his eyes and his entire body dropped down.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Ziyan, the Old Ancestor of Zuoshi Clan died!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s wounds recovered very quickly. It was just that his bloody clothes made him look like he was in a extremely sorry state. But all of these were no longer of any importance, he had won. The remaining people were just the same as a the beginning. It was very easy for him to kill warriors like them, who only had strength worth one and a half stars.</p>
 <p>The effect of 7 Stars Armour hadn't disappeared. After all, it would last for an hour and it had only been half an hour. He had half of the time left.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rode on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and immediately used the Mighty Elephant Stomp to blow them away. How would people with strength worth one and a half stars dare to face the shockwaves with strength that was worth two and a half stars?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, used the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion to kill the warriors who fell for his trap. Previously, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant killed one of the warriors and injured the other one of them. Hence, there were only four warriors left who could still fight.</p>
 <p>The battle turned into a one-sided massacre!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Combination Sword Technique!</p>
 <p>The effect of the Crystal Demonic Beast Card was gone. Against these people, Qing Shui could only ignore up to 20% of their attacks with his Critical Damage. However, his Combination Sword Technique also helped increase his offensive power by another 20%. So if he was to include the State of One with Elephant into it, he would be able to instantly kill them. This was because of Qing Shui’s extremely strong defense. As long as they didn't hit Qing Shui’s vitals, he wouldn't be threatened by anything.</p>
 <p>The last person Qing Shui killed was Zuoshi Yun.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who was standing in mid-air slowly calmed down. It was done, everything had come to an end. This fight helped Qing Shui feel a lot of stuff. It didn't matter if his strength hadn't gone through any breakthroughs, he managed to break through a lot in his mind. It was just like when you compare a person who has never gone out to a person who has been to a lot of places, they would have a lot of experiences. The more you see, the more you learn, the same applied to warriors. This match was very important to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>After he dropped down, Qing Shui put away the Thunderbolt Spear. Even though it wouldn't really be useful to him, he should still keep good stuff like this. If he was to give it to someone, it would still be considered doing someone a favor.</p>
 <p>The inner cores of the Golden Eagles produced a lot of stuff . At first, Qing Shui planned to refine Demons but he took his idea back. There were a lot of opportunities for him to do so in the future.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked into the sky. He didn't leave but went back to the place near Zuoshi Clan. He looked at the surroundings of the house from afar as well as the nearby stuff around it. Zuoshi Clan was a secluded Clan. It already had a small population to begin with. Even though he killed quite a lot of their members last time, there were a few who managed to escape. Qing Shui wanted to test his luck and see if there was anyone from the clan who would come back to retrieve their treasures.</p>
 <p>It's impossible for a supreme aristocratic clan to not have any treasures. Qing Shui felt that it would be a waste if he gave up on it, hence, he decided to guard this place for a few more days. If he could get the things which Zuoshi Clan left behind, it would definitely help him avoid a lot of trouble.</p>
