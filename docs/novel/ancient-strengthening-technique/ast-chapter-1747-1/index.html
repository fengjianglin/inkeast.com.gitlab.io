The Pearl’s effect was not weaker compared to the Divine Water Beads. This increased Yiye Jiange's abilities by close to three folds. Both her physique and the legacy that she possessed had an undeniable effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange had the Drakaina legacy in addition to her powerful physique. Therefore, Qing Shui didn't find this result strange at all. Then Yiye Jiange got the Buddha Sword to recognize her as its owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The displayed prowess when Yiye Jiange was using the Buddha Sword was undeniable. After he got the sword, Qing Shui had already made up his mind to give it to her. Even he was astonished when this snow white longsword's holy and pure aura, perfectly merged together with Yiye Jiange's aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too perfect. It seemed as if this sword had been prepared just for Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Buddha Sword recognized Yiye Jiange as its owner, it also demonstrated powerful abilities. Qing Shui could tell from his Heavenly Vision Technique and even he found it unbelievable.</span></p>

The name wasn't important. What important was that this sword was suitable for Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It increased all abilities by two folds and an additional five folds to her speed, reduced all damages by at least half, increased the body's endurance, and the recovery of all injuries by five folds.</span></p>

Even Qing Shui felt a little envious. In terms of attacks, his own Golden Battle Halberd wasn't a match for this Sacred Jade Divine Sword. However, his Golden Battle Halberd could damage Divine Artifacts. Although the possibility of destroying Divine Artifacts was still very low, even some people who had reached the pinnacle in Body Refinement might not be able to fend off its powerful destructive force. The Golden Battle Halberd was the nemesis to those who had a powerful defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the Sacred Jade Divine Sword was a growing Divine Artifact, and this just made it even rarer. However, Qing Shui felt puzzled that there was no story behind this Divine Artifact. He didn't see anything on it. Could it be that it had yet to progress to that level?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn't important, as long as it was something good. Right now, the increase of Yiye Jiange's strength made her the strongest existence next to Qing Shui out of the story. Right now, she was only a little bit weaker than Qing Shui and her strength had surpassed 30,000 Dao force...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought about the introduction of the ladies in the Portraits of Beauty. They were exceptional talents with Divine Bodies and by the look of it, as long as they had the opportunity, their abilities would improve in leaps and bounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui was very happy that Yiye Jiange had become so strong. He heaved a sigh of relief. After all, he was going to leave. Right now, both Yiye Jiange's and Muyun Qingge's power had increased tremendously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this delay, half of the day had passed. Qing Shui looked at Qing Hanye. Although she hadn't shown anything on her face from the beginning to the end, he could still feel the little feeling of dejection in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't try to hide anything and just reached out his hand to take hers. Qing Hanye's face turned a little flushed. Right now, she was still very shy before Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've thought about it a little earlier. You have the Nine Yin Body and there are still the Five Elements Pearls with the metal, wood, fire, and earth attributes. You aren't able to use the one with the fire attribute, but I can. Moreover, with our physiques, we can each take two pearls. I can take metal and fire pearls while you take wood and earth pearls."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui said these, he took out two pearls and handed them to Qing Hanye. "Come, let's go and increase our prowess."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pulled Qing Hanye with him to a quieter place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's strength was explosive and the metal attribute was extremely sharp, a good match for the Golden Battle Halberd's nature. Each person could only take one of the Five Elements Pearl, but Qing Shui and Qing Hanye had unique physiques. Qing Shui had no idea if it was a good thing. For example, in Qing Hanye's case, her physique brought her a lot of problems. She couldn't be an ordinary woman and in this lifetime, she could only become husband and wife with a man who had the Nine Yang Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was lucky and encountered one. Otherwise, she would really have to be alone throughout her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the situation was different for Qing Shui. The Nine Yang Body and the Nine Yin Body had vast differences. This was also something which puzzled Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Hanye used the Five Elements Pearl with the earth and wood attributes, she received an unprecedented increase in her power. However, it was only an increase around two folds. This made Qing Shui very puzzled. When he used the two pearls, his physical strength had only increased by one fold...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui seemed to understand it now. The stronger one was, the lesser was the increase. For Yiye Jiange's case, she had an increase of three folds. For Qing Hanye, her abilities increased by two folds, while he only received an increase of one fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was in fact very terrifying. Right now, it was possible for one to suddenly increase their abilities but it was only from a breakthrough to a new level. Qing Shui was very satisfied. Right now, his strength had reached about 90,000 dao force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Yiye Jiange and Qing Hanye were slightly over 30,000 dao force. Muyun Qingge was slightly lower. Luo Qingcheng and Muyun Qingge was about the same as Muyun Qingge, but was slightly higher, at a bit over 20,000 dao force. It was a pity that…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wrote down the martial techniques in the Five Elements Pearls and gave each of them a copy. The Five Elements Pearls had already been distributed and Muyun Qingge gave Qing Shui those rare metal that she had obtained previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an amazing meteoric iron and qualitywise, better than any other metals that Qing Shui had seen in the past. Qing Shui thought of the Sun Shooting Bow and recalled Muyun Qingge’s high proficiency in archery. To think that he had forgotten about this previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Drakaina tribe were naturally proficient in the using of bow and arrows. Thinking of this, Qing Shui gave the Sun Shooting Bow to Muyun Qingge and said, "I'll forge some arrows for you later."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge hesitated a little before receiving the Sun Shooting Bow from Qing Shui. However, the moment she held it, something strange happened. A brilliant glow encompassed Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. The Divine Artifact had recognized its owner by itself...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had forgotten that the Sun Shooting Bow was also a Divine Artifact. To have a Divine Artifact recognized an owner by itself was the most amazing thing. However, the possibility of this to happen was too low and this was also the first time, that Qing Shui had seen this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge seemed to be stunned as well and only regained her sense after so long. Qing Shui also sensed that Muyun Qingge's powers had increased tremendously once again, and had surpassed Yiye Jiange and Qing Hanye. However, she didn't surpass them by much and her strength was at about 40,000 dao force...</span></p>

Most importantly, the Sun Shooting Bow's shape had also changed. It was however just a minor change. The main thing was that the bow could now be used as a sword.</span></p>
