 <div class="innerContent fr-view" id="chapterContent">

  <p dir="ltr"><strong>558 Towards the Central Continent, The Triple-Eyed Grass Green Frog</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There’s no need for that, Sister Chen. By the time we reach the Central Continent, give me some time and I will give her another set, alright?” Qing Shui sincerely told Di Chen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You still have more of these Five Elements Fruits?” Di Qing was surprised. Qing Shui had already gifted ten to her sister earlier so she didn’t expect him to still have more…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“But I need more time.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone dropped the topic after that. The time had been set. They would set off in only three days’ time!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui returned to the Qing Clan and was prepared to spend some quality time with his family over these three days. After all, his trip to the Central Continent would take at least two years. It was impossible for Qing Shui to return home once a year due to the long distance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was happy whenever he thought of the Fire Bird. It was quite different than it was before. Not many human cultivators or demonic beasts under the Martial Saint level could defeat it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone naturally gathered together when they knew that Qing Shui was leaving soon. The cultivation of the few ladies had also improved by a lot. Canghai Mingyue and Yiye Jiange were now at the peak Martial King realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ling Zhanhan oversaw the Qing Clan and his strength was considered one among the best of the Greencloud City. Furthermore, none of the Qing Clan’s disciples were below Xiantian now. The Qing Clan’s strength was no longer negligible.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan and Yuchang were extremely clingy to Qing Shui. The little lasses were more sensible now, especially Luan Luan. She who possessed the Heart of Seven Orifices could almost match up to child of sixteen or seventeen years old, even surpass them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since Huoyun Liu-Li had a breakthrough in relationship, her face was almost glowing and she looked extremely beautiful. Qing Shui now felt guilty for not, since he had been busy with cultivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Over these three days, Qing Shui tried to squeeze out more time to be in their company. He mostly had to visit a few bedrooms at night. They were more daring perhaps because they knew he would be leaving soon again. This allowed Qing Shui to enjoy the boundless pleasures they could offer to the greatest extent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He basically used every single position he knew. Even the reserved Canghai Mingyue allowed him to do her from behind once. The slapping noises generated from him ramming against that sexy, fair ass made Qing Shui felt like he was floating in the realm of the immortals.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt the entire world shaking with every movement of those beautiful hips…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three days passed very quickly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, take care of yourself on your journey,” Qing Yi worriedly reminded while pulling onto him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry, Mother. Your son is old enough not to worry you anymore,” he assured Qing Yi. &nbsp;The moment of parting was always the most depressing one.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have a safe journey!” Qing Luo smiled at Qing Shui. Lin Zhanhan nodded at him from the side. He didn’t say anything but it was all conveyed in this small action.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Qing’er, travel safely!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will be fine, sister!” Di Qing laughed at Di Chen. Qing Shui stood at one side and nodded with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, hug!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan exclaimed, immediately leaping into Qing Shui’s arms!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Me too!” Yuchang stood at another side while tugging on Qing Shui’s sleeve.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stretched out his other arm and lifted Yuchang into his embrace as well!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let us be off. If we don’t, they’re going to cry!” Di Qing told Qing Shui softly in a mild tone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He waved once again at the Qing Clan before climbing onto the back of Fire Bird with Di Chen!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fire Bird let out a clear screech and spread its gigantic wings, slowly taking off. The figures standing in the distance gradually became smaller and smaller until they completely vanished from his field of vision.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You hate to part with them?” Di Qing stood beside Qing Shui and asked softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I haven’t been around much after sixteen years old, so I’m never spending enough time with them,” Qing Shui said slowly. His gaze was still fixed on the place where he could no longer see.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are a good person. A true man.” Di Qing smiled at him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui choked at her statement. He didn’t expect such a refined and beautiful woman to tell him something like this. It felt a little coquettish and he was mostly unused to it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What I am saying is that you’re someone who dares to admit and take responsibility for all your actions. You have many people who care and like you,” Di Qing quickly continued. Perhaps she, too, felt that her previous statement had come off a little odd.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you for your praise. It is very rare to get a praise from you.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why do you say that?” Di Qing looked at him. Her enchanting and beautiful eyes stared at Qing Shui’s. She wasn’t much shorter than him. With her hair pinned up, she had almost the same height as Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We fought during our first two meetings. Do you think two opponents can praise each other?” Qing Shui recalled their first meetings and still thought it a little outrageous even now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We weren’t really fighting each other seriously. Besides, thinking back on it now, didn’t you think that it was fun?” Di Qing couldn’t hold her laughter in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Fun? I was almost killed by you if I hadn’t been careful last time. I don’t see how that would be fun.” Qing Shui smiled wryly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You knew very well that you couldn’t beat me that time, yet you were still so persistent. That makes me angry every time I think about it. It was rare for me to lower my voice, yet someone have the gall to even ignore me.” Di Qing blinked her bright eyes at Qing Shui, as if she was anticipating what he would say next.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am from the Heavenly Palace and I have already considered destroying the Sword Tower during that time. I’m a little perverted and you’re not bad-looking. I was just afraid of being unable to bring myself to kill you when the time came. What’s more, I wouldn’t have known how I died,” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It doesn’t seem like you are acting in front of my sister. You have even admitted that you are a pervert. Have you ever thought of doing anything to sister…..”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am not a good person, but I don’t think I am a bad person either. I still have my morals. The favors that I owe to Sister Chen are not something I can ever repay with my entire life. I will not allow anyone to bully, insult, or betray her.” Qing Shui softly interrupted Di Qing’s question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing watched how this man had casually made a statement like this, yet it didn’t seem like it was a pretense.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She didn’t mention anything else about Di Chen. She knew that it would be meaningless to discuss those any further!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s your plan at the Central Continent? Do you mind telling me?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fire Bird was now charging full speed ahead in the sky, reaching twice the speed of sound. With that speed, they could cover the distance of about 100,000 miles in a day. Even so, they’d still need a little more than three months’ time to reach the Central Continent. The regions in the World of the Nine Continents was indeed vast. It was basically impossible to leave a region without a super powerful Flying Beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know. I haven’t thought about that,” Qing Shui replied in a serious tone after thinking for a while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing was taken aback by Qing Shui’s response. She then asked in a strange tone, “Are you thinking of visiting the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at the remarkably stunning beauty before him as she knitted her beautiful eyebrows together. “I still don’t want to die yet. Even if I am going to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, it’s not going to be right now.” He lightly shook his head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing smiled at Qing Shui after hearing his words. She stared into the mountain peaks that were disappearing quickly behind them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The continents in the World of the Nine Continents were not connected to each other and they were a few million miles apart from each other. There were oceans, rivers and wastelands in between them. Other than a few specific passageways that were a little safer, most of those areas were extremely dangerous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Travellers who travelled between the continents usually had powerful Flying Beasts or Mythical Beasts as mounts. For those without a powerful Flying Beast, they opted for travelling by land. Otherwise, they might be finished off without a single trace left by a group of large flying beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Compared to the sky, the land was a little safer since one had strategical advantages when using the terrain. It improved their chances of survival. In the air, the mount was the most crucial key to survival. If anything happened to the mount, you would probably be torn apart by a group of demonic beasts, leaving you with no bones before you even reached the ground.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was why most people would opt to travel by land in a group. They would usually form a caravan and employ some powerful team to guard them as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The major teams that were specialized in undertaking these kinds of missions owned many powerful land-based demonic beasts. These beasts ran as if they could fly and were not in the least bit inferior to the Flying Beasts. On top of it all, they had high endurance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Then again, most teams wouldn’t normally accept this kind of escort mission which involved travelling between continents unless they came with extremely irresistible rewards.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not really worried about being attacked by any demonic beasts in midair because demonic beasts below the Martial Saint level would avoid Fire Bird as soon as they saw it. Furthermore, Qing Shui still had a Soulshake Bell with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They flew continuously until evening time, during which they stopped by a lake.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a very wide natural lake, much wider than Qing Shui’s entire Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. The water of the lake was very clean thanks to the great ecology in the World of the Nine Continents, even though the water deeper than ten metres wasn’t very visible. The lake water was light green in color, but the water plants, fishes, and prawns in it were quite a sight.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a vast grassland that stretched on boundlessly beside the lake. Many herbivores could be seen roaming around, while some birds came to the lakeside for a drink. The lake and grassland basked in the evening sunset, creating a harmoniously tranquil scenery.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lied down on the slanted grass by the lakeside. He felt unusually serene in his heart. Although he didn’t really know how to put it in words, he felt exceptionally tranquil.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing walked to his side and sat down with her arms wrapped around her knees. She crooked her head to look at Qing Shui who was lying by her side.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you exhausted?” Di Qing softly asked him with a smile on her face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why do you ask?” He turned his head around to look at this lady who was in very close proximity to him. She was indeed a gorgeous lady with bewitching beauty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ve heard some things about you. Ever since your coming of age ceremony, you seem to have gone through quite a lot over the past ten year. I’ve heard you even have quite a handful of near death experiences. Are you miserable?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Not all all. When you have dreams and motivation, you won’t feel the miserable at all. Every single time your dream comes true, it is like a great happiness and wealth. Besides, I’m doing all these things willingly. If someone is willing, they would not feel miserable no matter how difficult things can be,” Qing Shui laughed as he recalled everything he had been through for these past few years. It was a very hearty laugh.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s true. You should be very blessed. You have a mother who loves you, many family members who are very close to you, even a few stunning ladies who love you. There should be many people who envy you.” Di Qing blinked those intoxicating eyes as she gazed at him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that women were always passive. The beauty of the lady standing before him was otherworldly, her pitch black eyes exuding an illusory aura. Her body was slender and lithe; the curves of her body were soft and delicate. She was stunningly elegant despite being plainly dressed. Her beauty was not icy cold, but the aura she exuded were a mix of dominance and coldness. Her beauty was ethereal and hazy, but one would be enchanted after seeing her alluring eyes! She was a woman that was extremely difficult to manage, yet one that was an elegant and noble.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although she was smiling, Qing Shui couldn’t really tell what she was thinking. Her extraordinary grace was even harder to grasp than Di Chen, as she forever exuded an illusory air around her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, envious huh? Actually having one woman to love is the happiest thing. Give her all the love and love everything about her,” Qing Shui randomly said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stood up and walked towards the lakeside after finishing his sentence, leaving Di Qing to sit there, a little baffled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pure Gold Fishing Rod!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After seeing the lake, Qing Shui had the sudden urge to fish. He naturally recalled his Pure Gold Fishing Rod, a heaven-defying graded treasure.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Something took the bait!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He saw a green fish being hooked. It was a Grass Carp of about half a foot long, highly intelligent and delicious. It was considered to be a high grade consumable fish on the market.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He retrieved a water bucket that was filled halfway and tossed the Grass Carp in it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He reeled in another three Grass Carps, two water snakes and a gigantic frog in his subsequent attempts. The gigantic frog was about the size of a three-years-old toddler. As long as something became too huge it would look extremely terrifying, no matter what it was. Although this gigantic frog was neither a demonic beast nor a wild beast, Qing Shui instantly dumped it back into the water after seeing its horrifying size.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was ready to stop after one final reel!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing walked to Qing Shui’s side as she watched him in great interest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can I have a try too?” Her voice was very soft.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Di Qing who was a little shy. At just a glance, he could tell that she seldom behaved like this. He passed the Pure Gold Fishing Rod to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing happily accepted the rod. Qing Shui could tell that she had fished a lot in the past from the way she skillfully handled the rod.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time it took a little longer. Talking should be strictly avoided when fishing, so both of them stayed very close to each other, neither of them speaking. Qing Shui was waiting for her to reel in one or two more fish, after which they would go stew some fish soup.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fifteen minutes passed but the fishing bobber remained still. When Qing Shui was fishing earlier, he could reel in about four Grass Carps and some other fishes in just fifteen minutes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing turned her head around and threw Qing Shui a couple of questioning looks in between, as if asking him for an explanation. Qing Shui only shook his head with a smile!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It moved!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the space of nearly half a breath, Di Qing immediately pulled the Pure Gold Fishing Rod with all her might. However, he threw the fishing rod and fled with a red face as soon as she saw what were reeled in.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed at the things that were the size of two palms on the hook.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were two frogs that were doing their naughty business. One was lying on top of the other and Qing Shui couldn’t even identify which one was croaking in extreme dissatisfaction…..&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The truth was that as soon as those two dark green sparkling and translucent frogs were reeled in, he thought that those two little things were quite attractive. However, there were too many beautiful things in the World of the Nine Continents so he didn’t really think much of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But then, he suddenly noticed another eye situated slightly above and in between their eyes. It made them appeared to be mysterious and strange, yet attractive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Triple-eyed Grass Green Frog!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was suddenly excited to find a pair of them on top of that. He wasted no time in catching them and tossed them into the pond in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With that, the pond gained another species of living being. But Qing Shui was not excited because of that, he was excited because they were the Triple-eyed Grass Green Frogs! Although they weren’t powerful demonic beasts, they were precious medicinal ingredients and were extremely scarce. This was because they could only be found far away from human habitation, in places with an abundance of spiritual qi. Their efficacy could be used in medicine to raise the quality of medicinal pellets, although the amount was uncertain. Their other uses were also unknown. Qing Shui knew from historical records that these kinds of things were definitely of the Gifted Earth Treasure grade.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>558 Towards the Central Continent, The Triple-Eyed Grass Green Frog</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There’s no need for that, Sister Chen. By the time we reach the Central Continent, give me some time and I will give her another set, alright?” Qing Shui sincerely told Di Chen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You still have more of these Five Elements Fruits?” Di Qing was surprised. Qing Shui had already gifted ten to her sister earlier so she didn’t expect him to still have more…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“But I need more time.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone dropped the topic after that. The time had been set. They would set off in only three days’ time!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui returned to the Qing Clan and was prepared to spend some quality time with his family over these three days. After all, his trip to the Central Continent would take at least two years. It was impossible for Qing Shui to return home once a year due to the long distance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was happy whenever he thought of the Fire Bird. It was quite different than it was before. Not many human cultivators or demonic beasts under the Martial Saint level could defeat it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone naturally gathered together when they knew that Qing Shui was leaving soon. The cultivation of the few ladies had also improved by a lot. Canghai Mingyue and Yiye Jiange were now at the peak Martial King realm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ling Zhanhan oversaw the Qing Clan and his strength was considered one among the best of the Greencloud City. Furthermore, none of the Qing Clan’s disciples were below Xiantian now. The Qing Clan’s strength was no longer negligible.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan and Yuchang were extremely clingy to Qing Shui. The little lasses were more sensible now, especially Luan Luan. She who possessed the Heart of Seven Orifices could almost match up to child of sixteen or seventeen years old, even surpass them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ever since Huoyun Liu-Li had a breakthrough in relationship, her face was almost glowing and she looked extremely beautiful. Qing Shui now felt guilty for not, since he had been busy with cultivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Over these three days, Qing Shui tried to squeeze out more time to be in their company. He mostly had to visit a few bedrooms at night. They were more daring perhaps because they knew he would be leaving soon again. This allowed Qing Shui to enjoy the boundless pleasures they could offer to the greatest extent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He basically used every single position he knew. Even the reserved Canghai Mingyue allowed him to do her from behind once. The slapping noises generated from him ramming against that sexy, fair ass made Qing Shui felt like he was floating in the realm of the immortals.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt the entire world shaking with every movement of those beautiful hips…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Three days passed very quickly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, take care of yourself on your journey,” Qing Yi worriedly reminded while pulling onto him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry, Mother. Your son is old enough not to worry you anymore,” he assured Qing Yi. &nbsp;The moment of parting was always the most depressing one.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Have a safe journey!” Qing Luo smiled at Qing Shui. Lin Zhanhan nodded at him from the side. He didn’t say anything but it was all conveyed in this small action.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Qing’er, travel safely!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will be fine, sister!” Di Qing laughed at Di Chen. Qing Shui stood at one side and nodded with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, hug!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan exclaimed, immediately leaping into Qing Shui’s arms!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Me too!” Yuchang stood at another side while tugging on Qing Shui’s sleeve.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stretched out his other arm and lifted Yuchang into his embrace as well!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let us be off. If we don’t, they’re going to cry!” Di Qing told Qing Shui softly in a mild tone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He waved once again at the Qing Clan before climbing onto the back of Fire Bird with Di Chen!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fire Bird let out a clear screech and spread its gigantic wings, slowly taking off. The figures standing in the distance gradually became smaller and smaller until they completely vanished from his field of vision.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You hate to part with them?” Di Qing stood beside Qing Shui and asked softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I haven’t been around much after sixteen years old, so I’m never spending enough time with them,” Qing Shui said slowly. His gaze was still fixed on the place where he could no longer see.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are a good person. A true man.” Di Qing smiled at him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui choked at her statement. He didn’t expect such a refined and beautiful woman to tell him something like this. It felt a little coquettish and he was mostly unused to it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What I am saying is that you’re someone who dares to admit and take responsibility for all your actions. You have many people who care and like you,” Di Qing quickly continued. Perhaps she, too, felt that her previous statement had come off a little odd.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you for your praise. It is very rare to get a praise from you.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why do you say that?” Di Qing looked at him. Her enchanting and beautiful eyes stared at Qing Shui’s. She wasn’t much shorter than him. With her hair pinned up, she had almost the same height as Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We fought during our first two meetings. Do you think two opponents can praise each other?” Qing Shui recalled their first meetings and still thought it a little outrageous even now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We weren’t really fighting each other seriously. Besides, thinking back on it now, didn’t you think that it was fun?” Di Qing couldn’t hold her laughter in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Fun? I was almost killed by you if I hadn’t been careful last time. I don’t see how that would be fun.” Qing Shui smiled wryly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You knew very well that you couldn’t beat me that time, yet you were still so persistent. That makes me angry every time I think about it. It was rare for me to lower my voice, yet someone have the gall to even ignore me.” Di Qing blinked her bright eyes at Qing Shui, as if she was anticipating what he would say next.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am from the Heavenly Palace and I have already considered destroying the Sword Tower during that time. I’m a little perverted and you’re not bad-looking. I was just afraid of being unable to bring myself to kill you when the time came. What’s more, I wouldn’t have known how I died,” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It doesn’t seem like you are acting in front of my sister. You have even admitted that you are a pervert. Have you ever thought of doing anything to sister…..”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am not a good person, but I don’t think I am a bad person either. I still have my morals. The favors that I owe to Sister Chen are not something I can ever repay with my entire life. I will not allow anyone to bully, insult, or betray her.” Qing Shui softly interrupted Di Qing’s question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing watched how this man had casually made a statement like this, yet it didn’t seem like it was a pretense.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She didn’t mention anything else about Di Chen. She knew that it would be meaningless to discuss those any further!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s your plan at the Central Continent? Do you mind telling me?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fire Bird was now charging full speed ahead in the sky, reaching twice the speed of sound. With that speed, they could cover the distance of about 100,000 miles in a day. Even so, they’d still need a little more than three months’ time to reach the Central Continent. The regions in the World of the Nine Continents was indeed vast. It was basically impossible to leave a region without a super powerful Flying Beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know. I haven’t thought about that,” Qing Shui replied in a serious tone after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing was taken aback by Qing Shui’s response. She then asked in a strange tone, “Are you thinking of visiting the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at the remarkably stunning beauty before him as she knitted her beautiful eyebrows together. “I still don’t want to die yet. Even if I am going to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, it’s not going to be right now.” He lightly shook his head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing smiled at Qing Shui after hearing his words. She stared into the mountain peaks that were disappearing quickly behind them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The continents in the World of the Nine Continents were not connected to each other and they were a few million miles apart from each other. There were oceans, rivers and wastelands in between them. Other than a few specific passageways that were a little safer, most of those areas were extremely dangerous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Travellers who travelled between the continents usually had powerful Flying Beasts or Mythical Beasts as mounts. For those without a powerful Flying Beast, they opted for travelling by land. Otherwise, they might be finished off without a single trace left by a group of large flying beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Compared to the sky, the land was a little safer since one had strategical advantages when using the terrain. It improved their chances of survival. In the air, the mount was the most crucial key to survival. If anything happened to the mount, you would probably be torn apart by a group of demonic beasts, leaving you with no bones before you even reached the ground.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was why most people would opt to travel by land in a group. They would usually form a caravan and employ some powerful team to guard them as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The major teams that were specialized in undertaking these kinds of missions owned many powerful land-based demonic beasts. These beasts ran as if they could fly and were not in the least bit inferior to the Flying Beasts. On top of it all, they had high endurance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Then again, most teams wouldn’t normally accept this kind of escort mission which involved travelling between continents unless they came with extremely irresistible rewards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not really worried about being attacked by any demonic beasts in midair because demonic beasts below the Martial Saint level would avoid Fire Bird as soon as they saw it. Furthermore, Qing Shui still had a Soulshake Bell with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They flew continuously until evening time, during which they stopped by a lake.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a very wide natural lake, much wider than Qing Shui’s entire Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. The water of the lake was very clean thanks to the great ecology in the World of the Nine Continents, even though the water deeper than ten metres wasn’t very visible. The lake water was light green in color, but the water plants, fishes, and prawns in it were quite a sight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a vast grassland that stretched on boundlessly beside the lake. Many herbivores could be seen roaming around, while some birds came to the lakeside for a drink. The lake and grassland basked in the evening sunset, creating a harmoniously tranquil scenery.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lied down on the slanted grass by the lakeside. He felt unusually serene in his heart. Although he didn’t really know how to put it in words, he felt exceptionally tranquil.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing walked to his side and sat down with her arms wrapped around her knees. She crooked her head to look at Qing Shui who was lying by her side.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you exhausted?” Di Qing softly asked him with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why do you ask?” He turned his head around to look at this lady who was in very close proximity to him. She was indeed a gorgeous lady with bewitching beauty.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ve heard some things about you. Ever since your coming of age ceremony, you seem to have gone through quite a lot over the past ten year. I’ve heard you even have quite a handful of near death experiences. Are you miserable?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Not all all. When you have dreams and motivation, you won’t feel the miserable at all. Every single time your dream comes true, it is like a great happiness and wealth. Besides, I’m doing all these things willingly. If someone is willing, they would not feel miserable no matter how difficult things can be,” Qing Shui laughed as he recalled everything he had been through for these past few years. It was a very hearty laugh.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s true. You should be very blessed. You have a mother who loves you, many family members who are very close to you, even a few stunning ladies who love you. There should be many people who envy you.” Di Qing blinked those intoxicating eyes as she gazed at him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that women were always passive. The beauty of the lady standing before him was otherworldly, her pitch black eyes exuding an illusory aura. Her body was slender and lithe; the curves of her body were soft and delicate. She was stunningly elegant despite being plainly dressed. Her beauty was not icy cold, but the aura she exuded were a mix of dominance and coldness. Her beauty was ethereal and hazy, but one would be enchanted after seeing her alluring eyes! She was a woman that was extremely difficult to manage, yet one that was an elegant and noble.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although she was smiling, Qing Shui couldn’t really tell what she was thinking. Her extraordinary grace was even harder to grasp than Di Chen, as she forever exuded an illusory air around her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, envious huh? Actually having one woman to love is the happiest thing. Give her all the love and love everything about her,” Qing Shui randomly said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He stood up and walked towards the lakeside after finishing his sentence, leaving Di Qing to sit there, a little baffled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pure Gold Fishing Rod!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After seeing the lake, Qing Shui had the sudden urge to fish. He naturally recalled his Pure Gold Fishing Rod, a heaven-defying graded treasure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Something took the bait!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He saw a green fish being hooked. It was a Grass Carp of about half a foot long, highly intelligent and delicious. It was considered to be a high grade consumable fish on the market.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He retrieved a water bucket that was filled halfway and tossed the Grass Carp in it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He reeled in another three Grass Carps, two water snakes and a gigantic frog in his subsequent attempts. The gigantic frog was about the size of a three-years-old toddler. As long as something became too huge it would look extremely terrifying, no matter what it was. Although this gigantic frog was neither a demonic beast nor a wild beast, Qing Shui instantly dumped it back into the water after seeing its horrifying size.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was ready to stop after one final reel!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing walked to Qing Shui’s side as she watched him in great interest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can I have a try too?” Her voice was very soft.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Di Qing who was a little shy. At just a glance, he could tell that she seldom behaved like this. He passed the Pure Gold Fishing Rod to her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing happily accepted the rod. Qing Shui could tell that she had fished a lot in the past from the way she skillfully handled the rod.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time it took a little longer. Talking should be strictly avoided when fishing, so both of them stayed very close to each other, neither of them speaking. Qing Shui was waiting for her to reel in one or two more fish, after which they would go stew some fish soup.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fifteen minutes passed but the fishing bobber remained still. When Qing Shui was fishing earlier, he could reel in about four Grass Carps and some other fishes in just fifteen minutes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing turned her head around and threw Qing Shui a couple of questioning looks in between, as if asking him for an explanation. Qing Shui only shook his head with a smile!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It moved!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the space of nearly half a breath, Di Qing immediately pulled the Pure Gold Fishing Rod with all her might. However, he threw the fishing rod and fled with a red face as soon as she saw what were reeled in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed at the things that were the size of two palms on the hook.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were two frogs that were doing their naughty business. One was lying on top of the other and Qing Shui couldn’t even identify which one was croaking in extreme dissatisfaction…..&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The truth was that as soon as those two dark green sparkling and translucent frogs were reeled in, he thought that those two little things were quite attractive. However, there were too many beautiful things in the World of the Nine Continents so he didn’t really think much of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But then, he suddenly noticed another eye situated slightly above and in between their eyes. It made them appeared to be mysterious and strange, yet attractive.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Triple-eyed Grass Green Frog!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was suddenly excited to find a pair of them on top of that. He wasted no time in catching them and tossed them into the pond in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With that, the pond gained another species of living being. But Qing Shui was not excited because of that, he was excited because they were the Triple-eyed Grass Green Frogs! Although they weren’t powerful demonic beasts, they were precious medicinal ingredients and were extremely scarce. This was because they could only be found far away from human habitation, in places with an abundance of spiritual qi. Their efficacy could be used in medicine to raise the quality of medicinal pellets, although the amount was uncertain. Their other uses were also unknown. Qing Shui knew from historical records that these kinds of things were definitely of the Gifted Earth Treasure grade.&nbsp;</p>
