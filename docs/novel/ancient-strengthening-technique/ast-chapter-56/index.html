 <p><strong>Chapter 56 Meeting Shi Qing Zhuang again.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0056 – Meeting Shi Qing Zhuang again</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the thunderstruck expression of Situ Bu Fan, Qing Shui waved his hands towards him and beamed. Littered around the ground were the unconscious bodies of all his friends.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A bitterness arose in Situ Bu Fan’s heart. This group of friends, especially Shi Zong Yao from the Shi Clan, had already broken through to the 5th Grade of the Martial General Realm. Thinking back to when he had lost to Qing Shui in the Qing Clan, and after he returned to Hundred Miles City, Shi Zong Yao was the one who was the most vocal, and had scolded Situ Bu Fan until the dog’s blood dripped on his head [1]. He called him a pig head and other nasty sounding names, throwing away the face of Hundred Miles City. To think that now, that same“country bumpkin” actually defeated Shi Zong Yao. Wasn’t his defeat even more humiliating than himself?</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was just human nature. When there was only one person who was defeated, the person would inevitably feel that he is useless. However, when among the group, if a person with a stronger cultivation level than him had lost, then it was no longer a disgrace. It was a truth that the person standing before him was stronger than them!</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, the ruckus caused many people on the street to train their sights upon him. With no wish to be spectated like a caged animal in a zoo, Qing Shui motioned Qing Shi and Qing Shan to prepare to leave the area. However, the instant he turned his head, a numbness filled his heart. Was he hallucinating? The ice cold visage of the person which he had always dreamt about was right there in front of him!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qing Zhuang!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qing Zhuang was wearing a fiery-red pleated skirt, as her cold eyes were filled with complexity. She stood there mutely not even saying a word, and just stared at him silently.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Qing Shui now, felt his heartbeat quicken. The person he always wanted was standing right in front of him, gazing at him. Despite his experiences from two lifetimes, he was essentially still a virgin and did not have much experience with the opposite s*x. Although he had read a lot of dating theory books, and even watched many artistic films, how could that be compared to reality! Licking his lips, he told himself not to be nervous as he greeted Shi Qing Zhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“H… Hi! How are you doing? Do you remember me? I was the one who rode your emberlion steed that day when you visited the Qing Village.” Qing Shui rustled his hair as he hurriedly forced a smile onto his face to cover for the awkward moment where he had stuttered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qing Zhuang’s cold countenance slightly melted as her sexy red lips slightly twitched into a light smile. Ahhh that smile, it was akin to the brilliance of the life-giving sun in the dead cold of winter, and the blissful wind that blew past you during the scorching heat of the summer. Qing Shui found that he had forgotten the words he was preparing to say, as he lost himself in her smile.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Follow me!” Shi Qing Zhuang’s cool and sweet sounding voice drifted over, before she turned and left.</span></p>
  <p><span style>An extremely complicated feeling mixed with bitterness and depression arose in Situ Bu Fan’s heart. Shi Qing Zhuang was a woman who had been betrothed to him ever since they were babies, and she had never even spared a glance at him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui started, but he swiftly recovered. With a huge grin on his face he waved goodbye to Qing Shi and Qing Shan. That smile on his face was something that all men knew about – the smile of someone about to get laid. After the two of them had departed, Qing Shui speedily chased after the silhouette of Shi Qing Zhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Qing Shui heard the two words uttered coldly by Shi Qing Zhuang, he immediately came to rapt attention. Although he disliked pretentious and haughty ladies, but to him, this was the true personality of Shi Qing Zhuang! Furthermore, she had not even glanced at her fiancee, but had already spoken with him. He silently cheering himself on. </span><i><span style>Hehehe, seems like I’m really popular indeed.</span></i><span style> Not to mention that currently, Shi Qing Zhuang was the most beautiful lady he had ever met.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Behind them, Situ Bu Fan gnashed his teeth in frustration, as a venomous look filled with hatred was directed at the back of Shi Qing Zhuang and Qing Shui. Gritting his teeth, he swore, “F*cking adulterous couple, one day I will fondle her right in front of your eyes.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As they walked together, unknown whether it was mere coincidence or pre-planned action, the shoulders of Qing Shui constantly rubbed against that of Shi Qing Zhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qing Zhuang slightly wrinkled her brows, as she coldly stared at Qing Shui who was beside her. To her surprise, she discovered that this little fellow actually had refined and exquisite features, and had a face filled with elegance and slight bit of masculinity, with eyes filled with a clear sense of direction. This was a man who knew what he wanted to achieve in the future. Inadvertently, she could not help but to compare him to those “refined” men who were around her, who appeared gentle and kindhearted on the surface, but in reality were constantly checking her out secretly with eyes filled with lust. The difference between them was akin to that of heaven and earth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His eyes, were especially charming. They seemed to hold within them an enchantment that made people want to stare at them. In between his eyebrows, was a hint of heroic spirit that could entrance most ladies. Additionly, that cheeky smile of his was filled with enthusiasm and brightness on the outside, but Shi Qing Zhuang could tell that it was nothing but a mockery. She could see that hidden within Qing Shui’s smile, were traces of traits that were similar to her, aloof and proud. Overall, Shi Qing Zhuang could not help but to conclude that this little fellow was indeed good looking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Shi Qing Zhuang froze. </span><i><span style>How could I be so mesmerized with external appearances, and not to mention this is a kid that is even younger than me.</span></i></p>
  <p><span style>“Elder Sis Zhuang, why are you staring?” Qing Shui suddenly interjected, calling out a term that seemed somewhat appropriate. After all, Shi Qing Zhuang was about 5 years older than him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After hearing the term used to address her, Qing Shi Zhuang almost jumped up in shock, but quickly, got over it. It seemed somewhat correct for Qing Shui to address her as such.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t you know that you have just created immense trouble?” Qing Shi Zhuang calmly stated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Trouble? What trouble do you mean? Could it be that bunch of trash?” Qing Shui laughingly replied. Qing Shui could sense that the reply made earlier by Shi Qing Zhuang vaguely hinted at concern for his well-being, which caused his heart to be slightly warmed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Trash? You are right, but do you know who these trash are?” Shi Qing Zhuang’s lips lightly twitched, as though she was suppressing her laughter because Qing Shui just made a joke. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui shook his head, staring at Shi Qing Zhuang, waiting for her to tell him the answers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You should know that Situ Bu Fan is from the Situ Clan. Among the trash, one of them was my 2nd brother, Shi Zong Yao, there was also the young master of the Ding Clan. And do you know that the Ding Clan was a large clan on the scale of the Situ Clan? You really are something, first time in Hundred Miles City and you have already created trouble with three of the largest clans here.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sh*t.” Qing Shui thought. Never did he expected that Shi Qing Zhuang’s brother would be among the people he defeated. However, despite explaining everything, Shi Qing Zhuang did not appear upset, or have any hints of dismay or reproachfulness, even after knowing that he was the one who defeated her brother.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Although you defeated this bunch of people, you ought to know that with their caliber, there is no way that they were the main scions of the four great clans. Take my second brother for example, under the doting care of my parents and with the aid of countless spiritual medicine, he broke through to the 5th Grade of the Martial General Realm. But so what? What has it done for him? He severely lacks actual combat experiences, even a 1st Grade Martial General that has honed their skills in actual combat would easily be able to defeat him.” Shi Qing Zhuang explained as her brows slightly creased. It was as if she was trying to warn Qing Shui of something unsaid.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehehe, are you worried for me or concerned about me.” Qing Shui smiled cheekily, as though he was not worried at all.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“Although you defeated this bunch of people, you ought to know that with their caliber, there is no way that they were the main scions of the four great clans. Take my second brother for example, under the doting care of my parents and with the aid of countless spiritual medicine, he broke through to the 5th Grade of the Martial General Realm. But so what? What has it done for him? He severely lacks actual combat experiences, even a 1st Grade Martial General that has honed their skills in actual combat would easily be able to defeat him.” Shi Qing Zhuang explained as her brows slightly creased. It was as if she was trying to warn Qing Shui of something unsaid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe, are you worried for me or concerned about me.” Qing Shui smiled cheekily, as though he was not worried at all.</span></p>
