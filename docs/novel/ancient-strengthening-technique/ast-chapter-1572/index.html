 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;"A person's strength is limited. Brother, don’t put me so high up on a pedestal; we will have hope in defeating the enemy if everyone works together. Let's work hard for everyone in the Sea King’s Palace." Qing Shui raised his cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Those who are sitting here are all brothers, sisters and best friends. Our life and death go hand-in-hand." Muyun Qingge raised her cup of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Cheers!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dining table was quite harmonious. Everyone sitting here were all powerful characters of the Sea King’s Palace and were either the tribe's leaders or chiefs. The reason why they were so peaceful was because of Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Drakaina Tribe was also a Dragon Goddess' Tribe. They all have powerful heavenly techniques. In case they awakened the bloodline in their bodies, they'd become terrible existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them absolutely acknowledged their allegiance to Muyun Qingge. As for the question whether there was a more powerful patron behind her, no one knew. Though her bloodline hadn't awakened, her strength wasn't something anyone could ignore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each tribe had a chief as well as a few elders under that position. They all stayed in their domains but they all belonged to the Sea King’s Palace. Their honor and glory ran together with the Sea King’s Palace, hence they all joined together to fight against the outside invaders. After all, if the Sea King’s Palace fell down due to the attack, their only fate was to be taken as captives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the only exception would be traitors inside, as they'd be the opponent's outstanding allies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about the existence of traitors inside, Qing Shui remembered Yiye Jiange's previous words. Since she said that the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace had absolute certainty to take down the Sea King’s Palace, he wondered whether there was anything fishy going on here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the banquet, Qing Shui returned together with Yiye Jiange. After all, Qing Shui was her husband and it was proper that they returned together. Qing Shui didn't even have to look for a place to live and could live in Yiye Jiange's palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge didn't go to disturb them as this pair of husband and wife hadn't seen each other in a long time. Merely, she didn't know that nothing had yet happened between Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was just like the Crystal Palace, just that it was larger. It was pretty inside the sealing barrier and also quite clean. There was ample spiritual qi here. Qing Shui pulled Yiye Jiange as they walked through a path of stones with cypress like trees to both sides. Though they weren't tall, they looked good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them talked about many things during the walk. Those were all affairs which happened during these years. This place was quite important to Yiye Jiange currently as it could be said to be her home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, she was planning to return and find Qing Shui but she couldn't leave the place. She had obtained the Drakaina inheritance and if something happened to the Sea King’s Palace, she'd feel worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence the matter was delayed. She didn't think that Qing Shui would come to find her. At this juncture, although she hadn't seen him in a long time, she still believed in him. Since he had come, the current situation ought to be solved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She believed Qing Shui had the ability to do that; this was the one kind of feeling she sensed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange's palace wasn't big but it was quiet here. Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange entered inside. His mood was quite tranquil as he pulled Yiye Jiange with a calm heart, but he felt an indescribable excitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gazed at that beautiful soul-shaking face from time to time. Feeling satisfaction in his heart, he said, "Jiange, I never thought there'd be one day when I'd have improper thoughts about you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why didn't you have improper thoughts? Do I look that ugly?" Yiye Jiange asked though she knew the answer, but the two of them spoke these words as they were a form of enjoyment for them as well as a way to express their feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"In the beginning, I looked at you as my Master who has akin to an Immortal and I only held admiration towards you, feeling like a dancing clown in front of you," Qing Shui reminisced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, Yiye Jiange was also only in Xiantian Grade 4 stage then and there was no need to even talk about him. Of course, it was over 20 years ago and a lot of things had changed over these years, and their meetings had also dwindled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, both of their strengths had reached this level, and they remembered that many things had happened over these 20 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange thought of the Lion King's Ridge. The reason this man was unable to let go to such a degree was due to her. All in order to reach the target she had set down, a target to climb the Lion King's Ridge in 20 years and he had accomplished it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What are you thinking about? Feeling so happy." Qing Shui looked at the corners of her mouth curling upwards, they were quite charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I was thinking about the day when we had walked together before. It seems so distant now, but I can remember it clearly." Yiye Jiange tightly squeezed Qing Shui's hand as she said these words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Me too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They entered the palace as they spoke. Although it was called a palace, it wasn't actually that big and was the same as a pavilion. The interior facilities were simple and comforting and possessed a sweet fragrance. The entire room seemed quite clean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, there are people colluding with the enemy inside the Sea King’s Palace. They didn't act during the previous attacks but since the enemy is determined to win this time, they'll definitely act."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange said slowly after sitting in the room. There wasn't much time as they had to eliminate these conspirators before the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you know who they are?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Jin Liyu!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised by Yiye Jiange's words. He never thought the conspirator was Jin Liyu. Beastmen were quite simple and revered strength. Moreover, Jin Liyu was the 3rd Palace Master. Normally, there was no chance of conspiring with the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How can it be him?" Qing Shui was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I saw it personally. He only had one condition, but it's a pity that he also doesn't know that he was just being exploited." Yiye Jiange sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What condition?" Qing Shui was curious about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange blushed a little but said with a soft voice: "He wants me and Muyun Qingge as well as a water domain of the Sea King’s Palace."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"F*ck! He even dares to scheme for my woman. I originally thought he had a screw loose in the head but didn't expect he had fooled even me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Jin Liyu was the undiscovered traitor, then things didn't look well for the Sea King’s Palace. Merely Qing Shui didn't understand why he didn't attack beforehand. He wondered if the plan was to handle him alone later or capture him, Yiye Jiange, and Muyun Qingge all in one go. Qing Shui felt that the reason Jin Liyu hadn't acted before was perhaps he wasn't assured about the chances of success. After all, it wasn't easy to handle both Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui’s vulgar appearance and shook her head while smiling: "Actually, the Sea Dragon and the Vicious Shark Palaces also only want to exploit Jin Liyu, that's all. The reason they were attacking Sea King’s Palace is mostly because of Muyun Qingge so how they can agree to his condition. After the matter is done, Jin Liyu wouldn't be able to escape the fate of being massacred."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Drakaina Tribe's enticement is so much? Why is everyone planning to aim for Muyun Qingge?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange's complexion turned unnatural: "A Drakaina's body is quite special. A pure Drakaina can let her man obtain huge benefits and their descendants would also be pretty outstanding. Aren't these conditions pretty attractive?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed awkwardly: "So it's like that, it's very enticing inde..."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange wanted to say something but Qing Shui had already blocked her lips, his tongue forcing itself into her mouth, chasing after hers.</span></p>

After such a long time, the feelings between them had become clear again. Qing Shui didn't plan to let her off this time again. He wanted her to become his woman, the happiest woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Jiange, do you still remember my previous words?" Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange's pupils narrowed slightly as her pale face blushed, this scene was enough to make Qing Shui go berserk, but he made a great effort to control himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What?" Yiye Jiange asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't know whether she had forgotten or she did this deliberately, but he felt that she hadn't forgotten.</span></p>

Qing Shui turned while hugging her, making her lie on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange nodded her head shyly which Qing Shui felt was quite unexpected, but her heartbeat had clearly quickened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I remember saying that I want you to beg me to undress you and also want you to help me undress and then ride on top..."</span></p>

No man had dared to speak so wantonly in front of her. The only one was Qing Shui, so it was impossible for her to forget, eternally impossible to forget it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange slowly leaned towards Qing Shui's ears: "You're not allowed to be excessive!"</span></p>

He knew that for Yiye Jiange to do this was already similar to the Sun rising from the West. He hugged her as he gazed at her sexy face.</span></p>

Yiye Jiange clenched her teeth to say: "I want to become your woman..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange said that and then buried her head beside his neck, not agreeing to raise it.</span></p>

He could exploit that at a later time when it was needed.</span></p>

Qing Shui was completely nude now as he slowly leaned over her body, kissing her lips, nose, cheeks, ears, neck, and...</span></p>
