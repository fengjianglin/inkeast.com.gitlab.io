 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't kill me. I promise that I'll never have any ideas about her in the future." Mo Tianzhi didn't wish to die. He knew that the young man, who could defeat him in a single move, wouldn't be a simple character. It'd be a waste of his life even if he were to be killed. After all, his clan wouldn't be able to step out even if he were killed since he was the one who wanted to snatch the woman of an expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, I won't kill you. It's not that I'm afraid of the Demon Gate, but I just don't want to make things more complicated. However, since you dare to have ideas about my woman, I've decided to cut off your thing," Qing Shui said and smiled like a devil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Tianzhi's countenance turned ghastly as he clenched his legs tightly together. "Don't! Change it to something else! Please change it to something else! Otherwise, you might just as well kill me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Tianzhi cried out hysterically. He knew that everything, which Qing Shui was saying now, could become a reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then how about this, you can cut off one of your legs. If you don't do it and I were to be the one to take action, my aim might be off and you might lose two legs." Qing Shui took one step back when he saw Mo Tianzhi's horrified expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Tianzhi hesitated a little and gritted his teeth, slashing off one of his legs from the point slightly lower than where his kneecap was at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't say anything and turned to leave together with Tantai Lingyan and Nuo Lan. It wasn’t advisable to stay here for long, and it was better for them to return to the Northern Emperor Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan kept silent, and Qing Shui took her hand all this while, not letting go. This made Nuo Lan feel a little jealous but she soon smiled again. Why was she feeling jealous? She didn't have any relation with Qing Shui. Although he had seen her naked body when he was saving her, it was a special circumstance and couldn't be viewed based on normal situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon arriving at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Nuo Lan went up first. She knew that Qing Shui now had a lot of things to say to his woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't stay at the Imperial Cuisine Hall and called out the Dark Phoenix. The Dark Phoenix flew up while he and Tantai Lingyan stood on its back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They only came to a stop after arriving at a small quiet mountain. Only then did Qing Shui speak up, "You've come for the Five Tiger Immortal Palace, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmmm!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Have you forgotten what I've said?" Qing Shui said furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Qing Shui's enraged expression, Tantai Lingyan felt very warm inside. This man was afraid that she would be in danger. Knowing that he was worried for her, she said softly, "I didn't forget, but..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you think that I'm afraid of danger and am dragging it out, not wanting to help you?" Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No, Qing Shui, don't be like this. I know that I've been impulsive. You're the person closest to me. No matter what you do, it won't change the fact that you're the most important person to me." Tantai Lingyan gently shook Qing Shui's hand that was holding hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She seemed to be acting coyly, but her expression was still as cold as ever. However, in Qing Shui's eyes, her expression was very gentle. He hugged her and said, "I've been working hard all this while, but I still need a little more time. I've already asked around. Those people from the Five Tiger Immortal Sect used to be under the control of the Five Tiger Immortal Palace. They are now only in charge of the Five Tiger Immortal Sect, but they still have a position in the Five Tiger Immortal Palace that is not to be neglected. The Five Tiger Immortal Palace and the Demon Gate are allies, advancing and retreating as one. If we were to go now, we'll only be courting death."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know. I'm only here to ask around for information. I didn't know that you were here," Tantai Lingyan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Leave this matter to me and don't be taking on any risks. If anything were to happen to you, I'll really go crazy. If that were to happen, even if I were to wipe out the Five Tiger Immortal Palace and the Demon Gate completely, it wouldn't pacify the pain of losing you." Qing Shui tried to imagine the scenario of something happening to Tantai Lingyan. He knew that he really wouldn't be able to stand it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and gently wrapped her hands around his neck, resting her head against his shoulder. "Am I really that important?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You are, very important. Although I have other women as well, other than not being able to sacrifice one of my woman for another, I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you," Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're fated to have a life with many love entanglements. This is also why they're all so in love with you. Otherwise, it'd be useless no matter how outstanding you are." Tantai Lingyan sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't expected that a woman like her would say something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know that I'm not faithful to just one person, but I really can't control myself. There are many times when I try very hard to control myself, feeling afraid that you ladies would be unhappy if I have too many women with me."Qing Shui said awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I won't blame you. I won't mind no matter how many women you have with you," Tantai Lingyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shivered, and a dejected emotion rose up. Maybe she didn't really like him and didn't care about him...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I just don't like restricting you. It's impossible for you to give up your women for just one person. This is regardless who that person is, even if you have to give up your life. I don't know what I'm feeling now; It might be that I like you,” Tantai Lingyan said, sensing Qing Shui's dejection and lifted her head to look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That beautiful face was so close before him and extremely breathtaking. Her beautiful arms gently wrapped around his neck, and Qing Shui's arms around her slender waist tightened. He said softly, "Lingyan, I love you. From the first time I met you, I've decided to make you my wife. This also became a motivation for me later on. I've always been working hard to progress so that I can be a match for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan knew this. Qing Shui had told her about this in the past. However, there was now a confession added in, and it made her turn a little red. She thought of the first time they had met; how young and inexperienced he had looked back then. He was only just an immature young man at that time, but he had awakened her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm your woman. I'll be yours in this entire lifetime," Tantai Lingyan said shyly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at her embarrassed expression lit up a fire in Qing Shui's heart. There had been a fire raging in his heart for the past few days. They had been away from each other for too long, and Qing Shui had a strong urge. He said, a little jittery, "I'd like to kiss... you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan lowered her head and replied, "Mmm." Qing Shui had no idea if she had agreed. Just as he was wondering if he should lift up her head, Tantai Lingyan raised her head slightly. However, her pair of beautiful eyes were shut, and her thick black eyelashes gave off an indescribable feeling of beauty.</span></p>

It gave him an indescribable feeling. He kissed lightly on those slightly cold lips, sucking those lips that were like petals, while a breathtaking feeling surged through his spine.</span></p>
