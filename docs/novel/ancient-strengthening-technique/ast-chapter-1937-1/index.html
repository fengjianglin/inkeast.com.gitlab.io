 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui would do it. In his past life, the rich guys would find some renowned teachers for their own children, even for primary level tutors. This was crucial, one of the essences was to attach an identity to the kid. Whenever needed, the teacher’s name would uphold the student’s status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same in the World of Nine Continents. The fundamental of a great education was to find a good teacher with great strength and high status. Even if the kid failed to be very successful in the future, his identity would act as a protective talisman. Normally, the others would never humiliate the student if he did not dare to provoke the teacher. That would be shaming the teacher, hence, no one would be so silly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not need that for now. It was pointless since being his son itself was a strong identity. Apart from that, he ought to be independent. Without the real strength, a superior identity would be meaningless. It was better to rely on oneself instead of begging for mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three years’ time was a brief period for strong warriors since they had several hundred years of lifespan. In three years, Qing Shui managed to build a steady foundation here. At least, the Great Confucian Empire and others had the inadequate strength to go against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he refined the Immortal Dao Divine Origin, Qing Shui reckoned that he could wipe out a daunting force like the Great Confucian Empire all by himself. However, Qing Shui was unsure if he would succeed, since nobody ever knew the existence of any terrifying old monster in the Great Confucian Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, Qing Shui’s current strength was terrific and he could hardly find an opponent of his level. The Paragon Strike could exert 1.2 billion Dao Force, that was astounding enough to overturn the ocean and brew the storms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of that, Qing Shui itched to find an opponent and polish his skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In three years, not only Tantai Lingyan achieved great improvement, the others had stunning advancements too. On top of that, Qing Shui’s presence in these three years provided inestimable assistance with his medicinal pills, Art of Healing, and Origin Qi to help them breakthrough……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone around Qing Shui had distinguished constitutions. Without Qing Shui, they would end up on the path of success too, but his presence enabled them to take a much shorter time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong could probably catch up to him. Now, they had 10 million Dao Force after experiencing several Divine Tribulation. They could probably stand side by side with Qing Shui if he did not refine the Immortal Dao Divine Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After refining the Immortal Dao Divine Origin, Qing Shui once again took the lead far ahead, even the strongest Tantai Lingyan, Yiye Jiange, and Qing Hanye could never catch up to him. This time, Qing Shui took a huge leap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye did not get pregnant or have Qing Shui’s kid in three years. Qing Shui was helpless about it since this was common among those who had achieved great improvements. Besides, one of them had the Nine Yang Body while the other had the Nine Yin Body, so their child must have a unique constitution. However, it seemed to be challenging to even have their own child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye wanted to have a baby too. She was afraid that as her strength grew stronger, she would lose the chance to have kids. Thus, she was demanding and tried very hard with Qing Shui whenever they were together. However, she failed to get pregnant even after these attempts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three years was relatively short to get pregnant, many people took ten years, twenty years or even more than that. She was not in a hurry, but she knew it was almost time for Qing Shui to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Imperial Cuisine Hall did not open a new branch because Qing Shui had yet to find a suitable candidate. It was difficult to find someone with superb Art of Healing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides, Qing Shui already lost the passion to look for a candidate. If he happened to meet one, he would definitely not cherish his own old broomstick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!” The Thirteenth Prince greeted Qing Shui respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In three years, Qing Shui taught him countless things. At present, he truly valued Qing Shui as his Master and was sincerely impressed without feeling awkward for his age. It did not matter when one started learning, the one who mastered the lesson should be the teacher. In fact, nobody cared about age in the Main Continents. Qing Shui also did not see much difference between fifty years old and five hundred years old. Only when both of them had the same strength, the fifty years old would have a larger potential than the five hundred years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong, Thirteenth Prince?” Qing Shui saw something from the Thirteenth Prince’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Old Ancestor said to pass over the Great Confucian Empire to me today,” The Thirteenth Prince raised his head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui startled and smiled, “Alright, I’ll go with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw this day coming. They agreed previously that the Old Ancestor of the Great Confucian Empire would let him accompany the Thirteenth Prince and announce him as the Master of the Thirteenth Prince on the same day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a nutshell, it was not easy to make the Thirteenth Prince the Great Emperor of the Great Confucian Empire. Other than being appointed by the Old Ancestor, they had to be convincing and received equally strong supports. Otherwise, the position of the Great Emperor would not last long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those days, the Barbarian Emperor got the position out of special reason. Plus, the Barbarian Emperor had excellent strength. When he was the ruler, the three forces of the Great Confucian Empire had their own different ways in everything. Moreover, the Great Confucian Empire was too huge, even several smaller Dynasty and Empire were already independent and out of control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Confucian Empire was aware of these but they did not voice it out. Anyhow, they were in no position to do so. They waited for the one who would become the Great Emperor to crack his head and deal with this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than that, the Immortal Palace and Empire around the Great Confucian Empire were watching over the situations. The Great Confucian Empire was a large share of meat with a rich background that accumulated over generations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that the Old Ancestor must have noticed his refinement of the Immortal Dao Divine Origin, it was not surprising. After all, it was something given by the Old Ancestor, it should be a piece of cake to find out about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Old Ancestor said there’s no need to hurry, we can take three to five months’ time,” The Thirteenth Prince thought and said.</span></p>

Go back and get ready, I’ll be there three days later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, Master, I’ll return to the Great Confucian Empire then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go!”</span></p>

This was irrelevant to the ordinary citizens, they were not concerned about the new Great Emperor. However, some of them cared about him too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people did not want the Thirteenth Prince to become the Great Emperor and he would be doubted. Without a powerful strength and support, he would never come to the throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also the reason why the Old Ancestor made the Thirteenth Prince Qing Shui’s student.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time fast forwarded to the big day, the Emperor City was full of crowd. Anyone could enter the Emperor City on this day, but the guards were constantly on patrol. The Emperor City was boundless, nothing from the past life could match with this.
