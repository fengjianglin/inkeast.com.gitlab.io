This wasn’t much problem for it, and even if it was a swamp, at the Dragon Slaying Beast’s level, it would be able to move around on the swamp as if it was on land. After all, it could even fly, let alone walking on swamps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Nuo Lan, can a dead Advancing Divine Worm be absorbed by demonic beasts to give them the advancing effects?" Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It can. Many people would capture and subsequently kill them. After all, they would disappear if you aren't careful. Therefore, people find it safer to kill them and then toss them into an interspatial silk sachet. With this, it doesn't matter if they are dead or alive. The most important thing is the Advancing Divine Worms' Origin Essence Pills. Although their bodies would also have a great effect, their Origin Essence Pills are still the most important component." Nuo Lan explained to Qing Shui. This was no secret and was known to many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at this endless stretch of the Red Swamp, Qing Shui had no idea where to go to even began looking for the Advancing Divine Worms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan, on the other hand, was very calm. She looked at Qing Shui and assured him, "We don’t need to be in a hurry. We can't rush these things. Those people are waiting and so can we. The Advancing Divine Worms can't be underground for over two hours. This means that after every two hours, the Advancing Divine Worms must come up for a change of air. However, they usually come up for only a short period of time, about the time taken to drink a cup of tea."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Qing Shui heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed plausible. The time for one cup of tea wasn't short, but he was only worried that these creatures would hide in very concealed places and revealing only their heads. It would make them very hard to find.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui mentioned his concerns to Nuo Lan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan laughed and said, "No many how sly the fox, it won't be able to win against a good hunter. People have studied this before. The instant these creatures come up for a change of air, they would fully appear on the surface, with a thickness of a person's waist and over four meters in length, similar to a size of a big buffalo. However, they would only remain in that state for the time to get a breath, and then they'd be able to change their forms. They can even dart into the swamps. Even if they just came up, they can still go back in. However, if they don't stay on the surface long enough, they won't be able to remain underground for two hours. Therefore, even if they were to dart back in again, they usually would have to come up for another breath of air not long later."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, people would usually stay in a spot for two hours and if there aren't any motions then they would change location. Everything depended on luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that his luck wasn't bad, but he still felt that the chance for this to happen was too slim. However, the moment it appeared, if the person was strong, there would still be high chances of capturing them. However, they would need help to surround the worms. Despite all these, the chances of the worms escaping would still be very high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's one over there! It disappeared again after a short appearance!" A voice rang out in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone shouted and many people headed over. Qing Shui looked at Nuo Lan, "Should we head over?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's go over and take a look. It might just happen to appear before us." Nuo Lan said, not minding it much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some things tended to be so mysterious and amazing. They didn't leave. Qing Shui felt a mysterious wave not far away and hit out with a Dragon-capturing Hands. And then, Qing Shui was greeted with a surprising scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It really appeared here. This should be that one which had been noticed by others previously. After all, it wasn't especially far away and it wouldn't be strange for it to disappear from there and appear here. Qing Shui had used his Dragon-capturing Hands to capture this big silvery-white worm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stun was not effective！</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Advancing Divine Worm was immune to any kinds of attack. Qing Shui felt the thing in his hand was very slippery and he was unable to have a firm grab on it. However, the worm would disappear the moment he were to drop it and he couldn't possibly throw it somewhere. Soil and rocks were all counted as the earth element and this fellow could enter the ground and disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui anxiously brought out the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace and placed the Advancing Divine Worm into it, and then tossed the entire thing into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was an amazing thing. Most interspatial objects didn't allow one to put in any sort of lifeforms in them. All kinds of lifeforms would be repelled. Qing Shui didn't dare to place the Advancing Divine Worm in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal just like that since there was also soil in the realm. If it were to disappear in his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, then he wouldn't be able to do anything about it either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he thought of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. With this, the Advancing Divine Worms could only wait quietly for Qing Shui's decision on how to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan was also surprised as she looked at Qing Shui, "Did we just get a hold of one so easily?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You saw it yourself. I caught it by accident." Qing Shui shrugged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ridiculous. What do you by accident? If others were to hear that, they'll be driven to their deaths." Nuo Lan said. She also felt very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You won't drive others to their death. If you don't hand it over, the two of you might be the ones to die today." At this moment, a voice rang out. A middle-aged man in black robes had suddenly appeared nearby without them noticing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw this person, he recognized that he was the black-robed middle-aged man he had seen earlier--the person from the Demon Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? Who are you? Why do I have to hand over something I caught myself?" Qing Shui looked at the black-robed middle-aged man seriously and asked, smirking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man had a pair of lifeless bulging eyes, with especially big scleras that made him looked very terrifying and others would feel uncomfortable. Qing Shui recognized who this guy was. Or rather, it could be said that Qing Shui found out what Demon King Inheritor this person was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silver-Eyed Demon King！</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was said that the eyes of the Silver-Eyed Demon King were very amazing. It was a pair of extremely powerful and mysterious eyes that could reduce the opponent's speed and control their mind. It had a lot of effects and were also very big. However, one's strength was also very important. If the difference between the two were too great, the effect would be a lot weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan frowned. This wasn't the Northern Emperor Domain, but they managed to encounter the Demon Gate's Silver-Eyed Demon King. They had no idea if there were any other members of the Demon Gate here. Not to mention, even this Silver-Eyed Demon King's strength was stronger than her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's unsure who'd be the one dying here today. I wonder if the Demon Gate would feel sad over your death if you were to die?" Qing Shui continued the provocation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Seems like you know a lot. I'll give you the time to drink half a cup of tea to consider. Otherwise, I won't be able to guarantee what will happen." The man said very happily and even stared at Nuo Lan with his pair of sanpaku eyes[1], as if wanting to eat her up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gestured to Nuo Lan. Now that things had come down to this, there was no other way to handle it. Many people had crowded around, but most of them were just wanted to watch the excitement. After all, this black-robed man had already stepped in.</span></p>
