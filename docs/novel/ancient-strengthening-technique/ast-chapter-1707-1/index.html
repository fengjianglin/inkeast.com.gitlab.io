 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui's current strength, he didn't manage to gain an upper hand in the situation due to the sudden attack. Moreover, it was also because he was worried about the ladies. After all, their gaps in strength were still quite large compared to his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hell Tigon's strength had already been weakened by the Dragon Slaying Beast by 20%. Despite so, Qing Shui still felt that it was a troublesome opponent. Thankfully, he still had some more moves up his sleeves which he hadn't used.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hell Tigon's huge body had been fended off by Qing Shui earlier and this seemed to have impeded its pride. It opened its great mouth and sprew out crimson flames toward Qing Shui and group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hell's Inferno!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like the Hellfire Phoenix's flames, with the only difference being in their prowess. Qing Shui wasn't afraid. He could neglect almost 70% of the damage from any spirit energy attacks. Therefore, although the Hell Tigon was very powerful, it wasn't much of a threat to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ye`er, you guys be careful. There's no need for you to step forth. It's fine to just help from the side." Qing Shui said, without even turning his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the three ladies, Qing Shui's relationship with Qing Hanye was basically set in stone. As for the other two, it was still hard to say. Muyun Qingge hadn't clearly said that she liked him, and this made him feel a lot more at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a man had all the ladies' affections to him, things would become complicated. Love was a double-edged sword, and if not used properly, it will bring harm to both parties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't that Qing Shui was playing hard to get. He just believed that it was enough. If there were more additions to his women, he would feel even worse. Men were simple creatures that couldn't resist temptations. When a man who had a sense of responsibility encounter situations like these, he wouldn't feel that it would be easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress had a mature charm and was also very understanding. Ever since she had made it clear to Qing Shui of her feelings and that she would leave things to fate, she didn't bother Qing Shui any further and only acted like an elder sister. However, Qing Shui could still sense that she liked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Be careful!" Qing Hanye called out as she continued to provide assistance from the side. She was very strong, at least, compared to the Sunset Palace Mistress and Muyun Qingge. She was around the level of Qing Shui before he had attained a breakthrough. However, when the Hell Tigon was her opponent, she could only manage to protect herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bathed in the Hell's Inferno, Qing Shui swung his hand and the Nine Continents Mountain appeared before him. Its size remained the same, but its prowess had increased tremendously. Most importantly, it had a powerful Shield Attack. If the absolute shield attack were to appear, it could neglect the opponent's strength and deal the opponent a heavy blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used the Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant onto the Golden Battle Halberd, neglecting defense and dealing an impactful attack on the opponent. Moreover, with the Golden Battle Halberd's traits, even the Hell Tigon had quite a lot of hesitation. It even felt a little scared, especially after having had two holes pierced through itself by the Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Battle Halberd's absolute penetrating impact, in addition to that explosive power, was something that even the Hell Tigon couldn't withstand with its sturdy and steel-like body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little damage only dealt a minor injury to the Hell Tigon's huge body. This was the advantage of having a huge body. Having thick skin and flesh was something which was compatible with any cultivation level. It was like the lethal difference for a person to be pricked by a needle or to be pierced by a dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui's actions had already angered the Hell Tigon. Its savage dragon head suddenly turned a blood-red color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bloodhand Dragontiger Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blood fog filled up the surroundings and it was as the fog had dyed the entire space with a red color. However, it didn't affect the vision. Within the crimson fog, a red phantom image of a Hell Tigon appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The phantom image was only ten-meter in size. Although it was considered huge when standing before Qing Shui, when it was compared to the Hell Tigon, with one being at ten meters while the other at 500 meters, the former was like a miniature size. However, it still contained violent powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aura it exuded was domineering and had a powerful overwhelming effect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The manors in Qing Shui's previous life were often guarded by items of tigers or lions. The Hell Tigon was a Tigon and based on the beliefs from his previous life, its ability to pressurize would be even stronger. However, this was merely a legend and no one knew if it was true or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor's Qi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui no longer held back and brought out his best techniques. The Hell Tigon's strength was once again reduced despite it just having recovered a significant amount of it. However, in all, it was still slightly stronger than when it had been weakened by the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything was within Qing Shui's expectations. An existence of such a level would have its own ultimate technique, just like Qing Shui's Paragon Strike. They tended to have their own special techniques that could increase their powers, but most of them were often too time-restricted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's Emperor's Qi and Art of Pursuing were heaven-defying paragons and could neglect all differences in levels. Furthermore, their effects couldn't be removed. They were truly very domineering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the blood red Hell Tigon was getting increasingly clearer, Qing Shui felt a little anxious. Everyone would feel a little nervous when facing dangers from an unknown future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Go!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used his mind to control the Nine Continents Mountain, sending it charging out toward the blood red Hell Tigon at rapid speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

He merely wanted to have a grasp of its abilities. Upon coming into contact with the blood-red Hell phantom image of the Hell Tigon, the Nine Continents Mountain was immediately sent flying from the backlash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the Nine Continents Mountain that was sent flying back, Qing Shui didn't choose to ponder anymore. He felt that there wasn't much time and swung the Golden Battle Halberd!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</span></p>

He had a lot of confidence in the bloodthirsty demonic vines. Moreover, he had also put in the most effort in this and had basically never failed when using it before.</span></p>

Earlier on, Qing Shui still believed that the fire element wasn't the wood element's weakness and it should be able to withstand it.</span></p>

Most importantly, Qing Shui underestimated the prowess of the Hell Tigon's flames. The wood element sacrifices itself to build on the fire element's power. He now felt as if he had smashed his own foot with a rock. He sensed the power within the blood red Hell Tigron, which seemed to be growing increasingly stronger.</span></p>

By this time the vines were all gone, the blood red Hell Tigon was already exuding black-reddish smoke from all over its body. It was as if an unrivaled ferocious beast had emerged from the underworld.</span></p>

This was bad. His physical body was powerful and his spirit energy even allowed him to neglect close to 70% of all attacks. However, he would never have expected that the opponent's ultimate move, Flame of Soul, wasn't included in the 70%.</span></p>

If one wasn't able to withstand it, they could become disorientated or worse, land themselves in a vegetative state. However, they wouldn't die nor would they feel much pain. They would instead, lose a part or all of their memories, and become mentally purged.</span></p>
