Other than spending his time at the Medical Pavilion, he had been considering how he could get in touch with that lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever he thought about this, he would feel defeated. He felt that he couldn't do anything...</span></p>

Now, what he had to do was to get stronger. When he could get sufficiently strong, he would be able to come into contact with that lady with no effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of the Demon Lord Palace's nature, they would definitely fight with other influences. When the time came, it would be hard for them not to have come into contact with each other!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quadruple Portion Alchemy Recipe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui studied this alchemy recipe in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The difference between the Quadruple Portion Alchemy Recipe and Double Portion Alchemy Recipe were that one could be that one allowed the user to use double the amount of medicinal pills, while the other allowed one to use four times the usual amount. The other thing was that if one had used the Double Portion Alchemy Recipe before, the Quadruple Portion Medicine could be used two more times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effects could not be stacked. Since he had previously used the Double Portion Medicine Twice, he couldn't use it for four times even with the Quadruple Portion Medicine</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a look at the medicinal herbs in the Quadruple Portion Alchemy Recipe. He realized that half of them were the same as the ones in the Double Portion Alchemy Recipe. It was just that the age required for the medicinal herbs were higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt that if he were to try refining it now, the success rate would not be low. However, the rate of failure would be quite high as well. After giving it some thought, he still decided to refine it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Recently, Qing Shui had already started preparing for the Five-Yang Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Four-Yang Pill was a critical point. There was a demarcation between the Three-Yang Pill and the Four-Yang Pill. It was relatively easier to move from the Four-Yang Pill to the Five-Yang Pills. The level of difficulty was all relative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After everything was prepared, Qing Shui started refining the Quadruple Portion Medicine. Qing Shui had already understood that if he wished to bring change to the Qing Clan and to the people around him, he could only do it through the route of medicinal pills. As for the martial arts, he felt that he still needed to study more about them. He felt that there were many techniques which weren't suitable for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were also some which were suitable. For example, Mingyue Gelou cultivated the Tiger Form, and Yehuang Guwu brought it to an unbelievable stage. Even Qing Shui felt that he was no match for Yehuang Guwu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greencloud Up-step Pellets, Yang Pills, Origin Returning Pills, Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellets and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets, as well as the Gold Needle Constitution Nurturing. Using the Nine Yang Gold Needle to strengthen the body, as well as some wine and cooking... Most of Qing Shui's items served primarily for one's cultivation. All these were Qing Shui's foundations and, with enough time, the rise of Qing Shui was something that would eventually happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around in his attempt to refine the Quadruple Portion Alchemy Recipe, Qing Shui didn't especially care for success or failure. Even if he were to fail, he would always learn something from it and get additional experience. Then, when the time came, he would be able to refine them successfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the Spring of Life, Qing Shui thought of the Devil Spring in the Demon Lord Palace. He had only heard of it but hadn't seen it for himself. Qing Shui didn't know what the Devil Spring looked like, but just felt that the name sounded a little evil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had previously heard that it could awaken the devil in one's heart. The Devil Spring would have no effect on ordinary people. It would only affect those who had a devil in one's heart. Everyone had a devil in their heart, but the devil in question here must be one that could be awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, a person might not dare to kill another person. But if someone else were to kill everyone else in his family, then he would dare to kill his enemies. In this circumstance, the devil in him would be considered to have awakened. The Devil Spring had a powerful effect to people like these, lighting up the power of one's soul, allowing his or her cultivation to soar tremendously. As for how far a person could progress, it would depend on the individual's aptitude and comprehension level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greater one's aptitude and level of comprehension, the more powerful one would become. However, the flaw would be that one could be controlled by the devil in one’s heart when entering a state of Qi Deviation. The person would end up with a desire to kill and become bloodthirsty, brutal, violent, and crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was a Devil Suppression Tree next to the Devil Spring. When Qing Shui heard this, he thought of the Bodhi Tree in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He had the feeling that the Devil Suppression Tree could be the Bodhi Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Suppression Tree produced the Devil Suppression Fruit, which could be taken as it was or be refined into the Devil Suppression Pill. It could prevent one from entering a state of Qi Deviation for up to several years. This was the Demon Lord Palace's foundation. If the Devil Suppression Tree was destroyed, the Demon Lord Palace would subsequently be destroyed from within many years later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui thought of the situation concerning the Bodhi Tree. The Bodhi Fruit was hard to come by as luck was a factor to be considered. The tree might not necessarily produce Bodhi Fruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed that Qing Shui would have to take some time to go take a look at that Devil Suppression Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than the medicinal pills mentioned, Qing Shui had also refined quite a number of Heaven Secrets Academy. In the past, Yan Jinyu had given them to him and they were medicinal pills from the Heaven Secrets Academy, therefore he was able to get his hands on the alchemy recipe. It was considered decent to have been able to increase one's physical strength by one cloud, except that the restrictions were great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After preparing everything, Qing Shui started to refine the Quadruple Portion Alchemy Recipe. He did it carefully, yet he wasn't too fearful about it. He had planned to just take it as an experience. However, the result made Qing Shui very happy. It had actually succeeded...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quadruple Portion Medicine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Effect: Can increase the amount of medicinal pills one can take by four times and can overlap the effects of similar medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very happy. The overlap mentioned should be that if he had used the Double Portion Medication, then the Quadruple Portion Medicine could only be used for one two more times. If he were to use the Quadruple Portion Medicine, then in the future, if he were to use the Quintuple Portion Medicine could only be used once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>

Although it appeared that there were only the 12 Earthly Branches and the Elder Association. Furthermore, the Elder Association would generally not get involved in ordinary matters. However, the 12 Earthly Branches were massive. Other than the Medical Pavilion, the other leaders of the other 11 branches each had an address as a Devil Chief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Devil Chief Jin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Devil Chief Jin was the leader of the 12 Earthly Branches'&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Secret Service Palace</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. He was the youngest Devil Chief in the 12 Earthly Branches. He was powerful and handsome, with a very bright future. Many people knew that he liked the Demon Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Devil Chief Jin had never confessed, nor had he done anything overboard. Toward the Demon Lord, he had always done his best. He could give up everything he had for the Demon Lord Palace, all for the sake of the Demon Lord.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Recently, Qing Shui's reputation was quite good in the Demon Lord Palace. Everyone knew that he had treated the Vice Palace Lord, even the Demon Lord had a meal with him before...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power of rumors were very strong. Right now, many people knew that the Miraculous Physician Qing Shui had come to the Demon Lord Palace for the Demon Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were people who said that Qing Shui was like a toad lusting after a swan's flesh, aspiring to gain something he wasn't worthy of having. People have said that Qing Shui was competing with Devil Chief Jin, and there were also those who said that Qing Shui's medical skills could be of help to the Demon Lord. Therefore, the rumors made it sound that the relationship between Qing Shui and the Demon Lord got closer and closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gazed at this man who looked very handsome and had a good figure. He wondered if a man like this were to go out, would he get taken advantage of by some ladies...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hello, I'm Jin Ci."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man greeted Qing Shui seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time the two of them had met!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hello, I'm Qing Shui."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're both members of the Demon Lord Palace, so we can talk about anything. Why don't we sit down and have a good chat?" Jin Ci smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright! This way please." Qing Shui smiled and welcomed Jin Ci.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Although Qing Shui had guessed a part of the reason, he wasn't very sure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother Qing, you're too polite. You can just call me Jin Ci."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother Jin, I shan't stand on ceremony then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's fate that we can meet. It wouldn't do for us to be so stiff with each other. Since we're together today, then I shall cut to the chase." Jin Ci smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't like to talk in circles either."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, then I'll cut to the chase. I like the Palace Lord..." When Jin Ci said this, he still sounded a little unconfident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. "Since Brother Jin likes the Palace Lord, then why don't you tell her that? It useless for you to be telling me this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Coughs... Brother Qing, please just speak the truth. We're all men. Do you like the Palace Lord?" Jin Ci was shocked by Qing Shui's words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Although the Palace Lord is cold and arrogant, there should be many people who like her. Yes, I like the Palace Lord, but you should know that it's useless to be liking her." When Qing Shui thought of that lady, he felt defeated. However, thinking he still had some advantages, he felt slightly more at peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right. Therefore, I won't feel anything even if I know that you like the Palace Lord. On the contrary, I feel closer to you. It has been so many years. I know that I have no hopes, but I can't give up on my feelings. Till now, I haven't found anyone with even a hint of possibility of succeeding either." Jin Ci said with a little bitterness as he looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If she were to like some other guy, would you feel sad?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course, but I'll only feel sad. It's crap to be saying that even if the lady I like likes someone else, I'll be happy if she is. I'd rather that she be with me without especially being happy than her being happy with someone else. I'm just speaking the truth, I hope that you won't make fun of me." Jin Ci spoke outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was how the people in the Demon Lord Palace were like, but Qing Shui liked this about them. "What would I make fun of you? I think the same. I don't like people who are hypocrites and who would care about their own reputation no matter what they do."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right. I really feel that it's an affinity to be able to meet you, but I won't be giving way to you." Jin Ci looked at Qing Shui and said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Women are not things to be given. Moreover, the Palace Lord isn't a person that anyone would be able to give away. It might be useless for us to say anything here. If a man is able to get her heart so easily, then we wouldn't have to wait till now." Qing Shui said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's true. If you can get her heart, I'll sincerely give you my blessings." Jin Ci said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You won't be secretly cursing me, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I won't. I'm not capable of doing one thing under the surface and secretly doing another behind others’ backs. If I were to really think that, I'll tell you honestly."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The reason I'm here today is because there's something I need your help with." Jin Ci gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? Brother Jin, please go ahead." Qing Shui felt that this was the real reason why Jin Ci was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'd like Brother Qing to help me appear more youthful. I've started to grow old. I wonder if Brother Qing can help me with this. I'll definitely offer you great thanks." Jin Ci said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had not expected this to be the case. Right now, Jin Ci only seemed middle-age. If it was really as he said, then in another two to three years, he would become the latter phase of middle-age, where he would really appear old and weather-worn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Jin Ci hadn't given up on the Demon Lord. He was a person who knew what he wanted and wouldn't admit his loss easily. Therefore, Qing Shui felt that as long as the Demon Lord wasn't attached, Jin Ci would never give up.</span></p>
