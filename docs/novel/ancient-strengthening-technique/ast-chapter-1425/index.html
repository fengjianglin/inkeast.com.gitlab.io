 <p><strong>AST 1425 - Divine Beast Sect, Lü Brothers, Ancient Ruin</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned around to see a mature woman. Her features were mature but refined; her lips were a bit thick, but they carried a bit of sexiness. Her hair was coiled up, which made her neck appear even longer.</p>
 <p>“Oh, Qing Shui, this is my master,” Shen Ling hastily told Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Greetings senior, it wasn’t any huge matter. Miss Shen has already told me the way to head for the Demon Lord Palace,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I heard Ling’er play a melody. She said you were the one who gave it to her. Would you mind if Ling’er let me look at it?” The woman said and smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Of course, I don’t mind. If you like it please, you could teach it to anyone,” Qing Shui said indifferently.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s attitude bewildered those around him. Any technique was a treasure within the World of the Nine Continents, so nobody would give out their battle techniques without proper compensation. The more powerful the technique, the more stingy people became. They would consider it a priceless treasure.</p>
 <p>The woman could tell that the melody Shen Ling played was powerful. But as her senior, and especially as a music addict, she would not dare to ask, especially if it was hers. If someone else taught Ling’er, sometimes teaching it to others was not permitted.</p>
 <p>“Oh, then thank you. Mister is now a member of the Demon Lord Palace. Divine Sound Sect and Demon Lord Palace stand on the same front, so if there is time, I would love to discuss and explore music with Mister,” said the woman courteously.</p>
 <p>“That sounds good. I am interested in the music of the Divine Sound Sect.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After they chatted for a while, Qing Shui focused on the Divine Beast Sect. The Divine Beast Sect was male only, and each of them carried the aura of a wild beast. Their body size did not matter, as they all carried the same aura.</p>
 <p>“You are Qing Shui from the Western Oxhe Continent. You killed people from the Desolate Sect Lu Clan.”</p>
 <p>At this time, a coarse voice was transmitted over.</p>
 <p>Two men from the Divine Beast Sect walked out. They were about middle aged. They were both tall and burly, and their bodies carried a terrifying wild beast aura. If one closed their eyes, they would feel a terrifying beast before them.</p>
 <p>Once he heard that line, Qing Shui knew who they were. They were the genius brothers from the Desolate Sect. They were the brothers who had the Heart of Demonic Beast. They looked alike, regardless of their height or body size.</p>
 <p>“I am Qing Shui. Killing members of the Lu Clan? I’m not sure, I only know that I kill people that are worth killing,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>These two had a scary innate talent, and they were both Peak Martial Emperor. However, they practiced Divine Beast Possession, so their real strength was at beginner False God. They were both beast tamers, so he was not sure whether they had also tamed some horrifyingly strong beasts.</p>
 <p>“Young man, you seem strong. How about we exchange pointers when things here are settled. I hope you can safely walk out of the Ancient Ruin,” the man said with much confidence.</p>
 <p>A single man spoke all these words. On the other hand, the fellow with the slightly darker skin tone had not spoken a word.</p>
 <p>Divine Beast Sect had two slightly old elders here, and they walked out, “What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>“Master. He killed the apprentice’s family. There needs to be an end to this matter.”</p>
 <p>“Is that so? Then, let the matter here be settled first before we deal with it. How about it?” said the chubby elder toward Demon Lord and Hua Rumei.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei smiled lightly, “If anything, just talk to him directly.”</p>
 <p>The old man was stunned, as he looked towards Qing Shui. Then, Qing Shui said with indifference, “I will accompany anything you want, but don’t regret it when the time comes.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, everyone, let’s stop talking now. We need to get ready to head inside. I believe they have already sent quite a few people inside. Don’t let them steal all the treasures.” Hua Rumei smiled toward the upset Divine Beast Sect members.</p>
 <p>“Right, let’s enter!” The woman from Divine Sound Sect said in agreement.</p>
 <p>“Enter. This matter can be discussed later, it is not like they can run off,” said a lean and peculiar old man.</p>
 <p>Member of the Wild Ghost Valley!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the elder who wore loose clothing. This elder gave off an overpowering gloomy and cold aura. Just as Hua Rumei had explained, Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley had a closer relationship.</p>
 <p>Moreover, these brothers definitely held a high position. Otherwise, they would not make enemies with the Demon Lord Palace for one mere person.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord took the lead, and the members of the Demon Lord Palace followed her. The Divine Sound Sect also followed them and directly flew toward the giant boundary.</p>
 <p>Some members of the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley would enter as long as they could break through the boundary barrier. The higher the risk, the bigger the reward. If they were lucky, they could even take advantage of the situation.</p>
 <p>A somewhat strong force was transmitted; it was the boundary’s repelling force. Those who were Marital Emperor and above could withstand it, so they could enter with ease.</p>
 <p>Vaguely, Qing Shui realized that he was already within the Ancient Ruin. Once he entered, there was an indescribable aura. It was very clear and had hints of desolation and ancientness.</p>
 <p>Looking further away, he could not see the end. There were shadows of the mountains and a giant green plain. There were sparsely spaced trees and thick luscious grass underneath his feet. There were some animals around, but it was mostly filled with wild beasts. Once they saw the humans, the beasts ran off in fear.</p>
 <p>There was an area nearby covered with rocks, and these giant rocks were all about the size of little hills. They were roughly a hundred or so meters tall.</p>
 <p>This location was mystical, and this area was still part of Dragon Chant Mountain. The boundary was at the reverse scale area of Dragon Chant Mountain. However, the surrounding area was spacious and empty, and he could see no end to it.</p>
 <p>Someone had found the Ancient Divine Shrine, but it was too dangerous. After many casualties, they returned to spread the news. In front of benefits and interest, sometimes life was no longer that valuable. Not that it was not valuable, but humans were born to like adventure, or perhaps they were born with greed.</p>
 <p>Most people would hope for fortune within their heart, so they would like to gamble.</p>
 <p>Of course, many people were also confident in themselves. Just like a cliché from his previous life, those who drown in the river all knew how to swim. Many of those who drown knew how to swim. Otherwise, they wouldn’t enter the water in the first place. Those who don’t enter the water won’t drown.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Divine Shrine was directly west. Qing Shui had not seen people from the Dragon Palace, nor had he seen anyone else. Right now, they grouped together to form a faction. With everyone together, even if there was an opportunity, they would not pull their back leg. Compared to the righteous group, their strength was weaker. If a problem occurred, those people that called themselves the righteous group would not mind wiping them out in the Ancient Ruin.</p>
 <p>These people treated the Four Great Evil Powers as the head. However, this time, members of the Demon Lord Palace would go first. That was because they knew that the Demon Lord Palace and the Dragon Palace were going to fight within the Ancient Ruin. There was going to be one side that fell in this battle. Perhaps both parties would fall or even be completely wiped out.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, we will go ahead first!”</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei’s words were enough to explain everything. They greeted the others. Then, they quickly left the location.</p>
 <p>After they left the view of the others, they consecutively used the Nine Continent Steps. They had already left the others far behind.</p>
 <p>Divine Sound Sect, Divine Beast Sect, and Wild Ghost Valley together. This was not a group that anyone could take down. Within the Ancient Ruin, having lots of people was not always a good thing.</p>
 <p>He used the Nine Continents Step until he had two uses left. Qing Shui stopped. These two uses were his life saving measures, as this place was unlike any other.</p>
 <p>This area was covered in grassland and forestry, but a large portion of it was in ruins. There were also rugged mountainous areas and swamps. It was a messy area that had lots of luscious plants. Many beasts existed here.</p>
 <p>“We will stop here for one day. Usual standards, everyone do their own things,” the Demon Lord ordered.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood, as he watched others from the Demon Lord Palace cultivate or patrol the area. These were all elites of the Demon Lord Palace, which was her foundation. To love her was to love everything related to her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of his formation.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation!</p>
 <p>This was difficult to cultivate, but those within the Ancient Ruins were the best of the best. Qing Shui saw Jin Ci and a tall burly man chatting.</p>
 <p>The Devil Chief of Battle Pavilion. His strength must be a terrifying existence. If he was in the Demon Lord Palace, he would be someone of power. It was rumored that he was an old subordinate of the Demon Lord’s family, and he had quite the sway within the Demon Lord Palace. Half of the matters of the palace would involve him. If there were any battles, the Battle Pavilion would always be there.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, come here!” Jin Ci looked at Qing Shui and hurriedly greeted him.</p>
 <p>Jin Ci was envious of how Qing Shui could hang around with Hua Rumei and the Demon Lord. However, he was undisturbed, as he was not one to remember hate. That was because even if Qing Shui was not here, he would still not have a chance.</p>
 <p>“This is Zhan Yu, Brother should know, Big Brother, this is Qing Miraculous Doctor. He is the one who cured Vice Palace Lord,” Jin Ci said with a smile with some subtleties.</p>
 <p>The smile made Qing Shui confused.</p>
 <p>“Qing Miraculous Doctor. Thank you for treating Rumei. I, Zhan Yu, owe you a favor,” the tall burly man said seriously.</p>
 <p>He looked like he was already past middle age. His face carried a healthy and manly aura. This fellow was a charming man, especially given his age.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards Zhan Yu. Then, he understood, “Brother Zhan, please don’t be overly courteous. Just refer to me as Qing Shui.”</p>
 <p>“Then, I won’t be overly courteous. Brother Qing, in the future, we will both fight alongside Demon Lord Palace.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, Brother Zhan’s relationship with the Vice Palace Lord seems beyond the norm!” Qing Shui said as he laughed.</p>
 <p>“She is my fiancé. We were about to get married, but something happened. Thus, things were delayed. I had wanted to thank brother sooner, but Rumei did not allow it,” Zhan Yu laughed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not thought that the man wearing a blood red battle suit was Hua Rumei’s fiancé, but he was happy regardless.</p>
 <p>“Brother seems to be very fortunate. Now that sister is healed, when will you guys get married?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“She said to wait until the matter here is settled. She wants you to be our wedding witness,” Zhan Yu said happily.</p>
 <p>“Sounds good. Oh right, I have a formation technique that might be of interest to you and Brother Jin.” Qing Shui took out the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation and placed it in front of the two of them.</p>
 <p>“A good formation technique, but it needs some time. This is our Battle Pavilion’s Battle Blood Formation that we have used for half my life. It would be too difficult to discard it and learn something else.” Zhan Yu looked like he was in a bit of a dilemma. Although the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation was good, the Battle Blood Formation was better suited for Battle Pavilion and its members.</p>
