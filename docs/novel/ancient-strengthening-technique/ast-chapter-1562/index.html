The blush on her cheeks was like rays of the setting sun. However, she knew Qing Shui wasn’t doing this to take advantage of her. She also could sense that at the point where Qing Shui’s finger tapped at, the cold qi within her body would be driven away. Next, Qing Shui began the acupuncture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did so methodically, slowly placing the Gold Essence needles around the woman’s body. Her left leg had the least number of needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body was completely exposed to him and the most sensitive part was also touched by him. She initially thought she would die but who would have thought he really did have a method to save her. How would they interact with each other in the future?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She suddenly felt something on her leg. A warm hand was clutching her feet and when she sensed that, she had already discovered that the cold qi in her body was being expelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that was the removal of the needles. Qing Shui’s actions were agile, finishing in a few moments. After Qing Shui removed the last needle, the woman hurriedly put on her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui had already exited the formation and removed it. He was extremely fatigued from the treatment. However, he heard footsteps behind him and when he turned around, the woman had already put on all her clothing and was following him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the matter?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman wasn’t wearing the conical bamboo hat. A red blush appeared on her face as she spoke in a gentle tone to Qing Shui, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “There’s no need to thank me. You still have to help me look for her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman now felt the waves in her heart which hadn’t calmed down yet. She smiled, “Don’t worry, I will take you there. Since Jiange is your wife, it would be wonderful if you also joined our Sea King Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui asked, “Are there many humans there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is naturally a lot. The Sea King Palace wouldn’t lack humans, and humans have many roles to play in there. Usually, for those renegades who have no paths left for them, they would all join the Sea King Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seems like among the power factions in the Sea King Palace, humans are the strongest.” Qing Shui was actually wondering how to find the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, indeed they are very strong. However, the vast majority are weaker than you.” The woman spoke in a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I still don’t know what to call you. Would you mind telling me your name?” Qing Shui politely asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Muyun Qingge.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are just like your name, as pretty as the sound of your name is melodious. Are the rulers of the Sea King Palace that of the mermaid race? I’m very curious about mermaids, do you mind giving me a brief intro? However, let’s drop it if it’s confidential.” Qing Shui wanted to know but he didn’t want to make things difficult for her as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mermaid is a unique race, but they are actually humans. It’s just that their talents and potentials are much much stronger compared to ordinary humans. For example, they are like people among humans who have unique bloodlines, like the golden bloodline, and the violet-gold bloodline.” Muyun Qingge didn’t hesitate and directly stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that is the case. Are there a lot of members of the mermaid race then?” Qing Shui was filled with inclination towards the aquatic race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not that many. Actually, the aquatic race can be segregated into many different races. They are the same as humans and their intelligence level isn’t any inferior to them either. Humans can cultivate martial arts and even expand or change their form for greater strength during combat. The aquatic race didn’t need to have any gimmicks and already have their natural form to depend on. One could say that the aquatics are more suited for combat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now knew that the ocean wasn’t as peaceful as in his previous life. There was another world in there, He then asked again, “But it seems like no one on land has discovered the existence of the aquatics.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A long time ago, humans and aquatics were allowed to enter each other’s territories freely. But after the primordial war, a new law came about. Before aquatics reached a certain level in strength, they wouldn’t be able to enter lands on the surface. Just like how ordinary people would drown in the sea… And even if they grew strong enough and could visit some places, their strength would be greatly diminished as they are not in their element. Only a rare few races wouldn’t suffer from this limitation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks for telling me so much.” Qing Shui now could be considered to have an elementary understanding of the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Earlier you still said there was no need for thanks but now it is you who thanked me. Although I have no blood relations with Jiange, we are like true sisters. Since you are her husband, you are one of my family as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge’s words made Qing Shui’s heart leap. The alluring effect of these words was extremely strong. These normal words when spoken by this woman would inevitably cause many to fantasize wildly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s already quite late today. Let’s set off for the Sea King Palace tomorrow.” Muyun Qingge stared at Qing Shui as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Qing Shui had no objections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll go rustle some food up, you can take a rest first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know how strong Muyun Qingge was but he knew she wouldn’t be weak for sure. He set up two tents here and he went to capture two mountain hares for food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s action was extremely proficient. Muyun Qingge kept watching him by the side and didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you hungry yet? Here, this is for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui passed a roasted hare thigh to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s cooking skills were legendary, the wild game’s fragrance was brought out by the roasting. This kind of meat had a very nice bite quality to it and every bite was filled with fragrance that was extremely satisfying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge ate a bite and stared with astonishment at Qing Shui. She had eaten many things before but this was the first time she felt that this was the best thing she ever had. Initially, she thought this was the feeling of ‘rebirth’ brought to her but after thinking about it, it didn’t seem like the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, her body had recovered but her heart was still stressed. Her body was seen and touched completely by Qing Shui so she didn’t know how to feel relaxed in front of him. She didn’t really have an appetite initially and only took a bite out of courtesy, but the moment she took a bite, she almost couldn’t control herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is delicious, isn’t it? Here, take this as well.” Qing Shui passed a hind leg of the hare to her after noticing that she had finished eating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hind legs of this particular breed of mountain hare were the most delicious part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge didn’t act polite. She simply nodded and accepted it. “It’s truly tasty, I’m so hungry today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you are hungry then just eat more. Don’t worry about your weight.” Qing Shui smiled at her. At their current level of strength, it was extremely easy to maintain their physique. For big people who cultivate, it’s either they needed that physique for some techniques, or they didn’t bother with how they looked. Naturally, there were also some people who cultivate that wouldn’t be able to change how they looked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if I like it, I cannot lose control.” Muyun Qingge shook her head gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that right now, she wasn’t calm at all. Her words had some hidden intents in it but Qing Shui understood and didn’t say anything. In addition, he didn’t feel that he was wrong in that matter. There was no right or wrong in that matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, I’m full now. You should rest early. We shall head to the Sea King Palace tomorrow.” Muyun Qingge pushed away her earlier unhappy feelings and smiled at Qing Shui before returning to her tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded in response, he understood she needed some peace and quiet. He noticed that there was still plenty of meat left. With meat in front of him, how could he not have wine to go along with it? Earlier before he had a chance to take some wine out, Muyun Qingge had already left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opening up a flash, Qing Shui directly poured wine down his throat. Muyun Qingge was in a daze in the tent, through the gaps she could see Qing Shui and when she saw him, her heart involuntarily pounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a proud woman, and was a palace lord of the Sea King Palace, completely controlling a region of water. Her lifespan was very long and it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that she could almost stay young forever. She didn’t expect to fall prey to the emotions of the heart so early in her life. She wouldn’t reject love so she wouldn’t run away if she encountered it. However, what happened between them was something she had never expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a traditional woman. If it was some other women in her shoes, being saved by a doctor, they might even repay him with their bodies. After surviving death, their perspective would be broadened and they’d also need an outlet to vent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After surviving from certain death, many people would change. They would cherish things more than before. There was another type as well who felt that life was short. They would usually play their hardest when they were young, spending extravagantly and having no regrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was neither of these types, she treated many things seriously. Qing Shui knew that her heart now should be feeling extremely complicated but she wasn’t willing to show it as she once said that she would rather choose death than to allow Qing Shui to undress her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maybe in her heart, she didn’t really want to die as well. She was merely looking for an excuse to allow Qing Shui to treat her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui ate and drank at the same time, soon finishing his meal. Martial cultivators are extremely strong and all of them have great appetites. If they used their yuan qi, they could even eat an entire cow in one sitting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning to his tent, Qing Shui rested for a awhile before entering the Violet Jade Immortal Realm. This incident with Muyun Qingge left Qing Shui a little perplexed. The countenance of Yuan Su appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su’s problem was the same as Muyun Qingge. Right now, Yuan Su’s relationship with Qing Shui was lukewarm as well, seeming neither close nor distant. Qing Shui didn’t know what was their relationship exactly as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, things were like this. The more one didn’t wish for anything to happen in terms of relationship, the easier unexpected things would occur. If one wanted to improve their relationship with someone, something contrary would occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already found his own way. He would just allow nature to take its course. Just like Yuan Su or Muyun Qingge, he wouldn’t intentionally force things. He had already treated Qin Qing as his woman; unless she decided to leave with hatred, he would never let go of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Staring at the spiritual spring in the realm, the entire Violet Jade Immortal Realm underwent a marvelous transformation because of it. There were even earth divine stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has been a period of time since he emerged from the Poison Dragon Pool. Right now, the Poison Dragon Flower had already matured. Naturally, the reason was that it was in the Violet Jade Immortal Realm with earth divine stones around it. If it’s out there, it would still need another ten years. Back then, Qin Qing also knew the Poison Dragon Flower would mature fast but she had no idea the exact time frame it would take. Hence, she wanted to kill the Poison Dragon before waiting for the flower to mature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the sake of this flower, many people were willing to wait several ten years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, Qing Shui wanted nothing more than to go to the Ice Ocean Domain. He wished to raise his strength to another level. Nobody knew how the world beneath the sea was, Qing Shui was filled anticipation with regards to this exploring the unknown feeling. How many terrifying primordial beasts were there? How many existences that are more terrifying than those on the land would there be?</span></p>
