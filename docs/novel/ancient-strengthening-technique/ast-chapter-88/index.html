 <p><strong>Chapter 88 The Power of the Agility-Enhancing Fruit.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0088 – The Power of the Agility-Enhancing Fruit</strong></p>
  <p>After Qing Shui looked at the description on the Stone Steele, which clearly indicated that the second level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was unlocked, Qing Shui looked at the agility-enhancing tree, trying to see if there was any difference. </p>
  <p>Next to the energy-enhancing tree, there was another tree which didn’t look much different. The fruits on the tree were almost exactly the same as the energy-enhancing fruits, only their color was green. It was a beautiful dreamy shade of green, unlike the green shade of an unripe fruit. </p>
  <p>This fruit looked out of the ordinary just from its appearance. The exterior of superior things were usually detailed, stately, or grand and spiritual. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui still didn’t understand why he had unlocked the second level of the spatial realm, but he just shook his head and stopped dwelling on it. It didn’t matter anyways since it was good news!</p>
  <p>“Didn’t I just f*ck a beautiful woman?”</p>
  <p>A light bulb seemed to turn on in Qing Shui’s mind. </p>
  <p>Because of the existence of the strength-enhancing and the agility-enhancing fruits, Qing Shui could assert that the next level of the spatial realm would probably bring stamina-enhancing, physique-enhancing, and magic-enhancing fruits. Of course, there could always be other fruits that he couldn’t think of at the moment, since these were just from a beginner’s guide from the game he played, and not really accurate. </p>
  <p>There was a Yin-Yang design in his spatial realm. Could it be that he and Shi Qingzhuang were combined like Yin-Yang today?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui dropped his jaws in shock. “Could it be that I have to make love to a woman in order to upgrade the spatial realm?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui suddenly became expressionless, with only one thought on his mind, “This spatial realm is so lewd!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “Maybe it’s a coincidence? It must be!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked towards the green agility-enhancing fruit again. There were ten in total, and each was about the size of an adult’s fist. With the experience that he had last time, Qing shui just directly picked a fruit. </p>
  <p>It was quite heavy in his hands, weighing approximately half a jin, but it didn’t come as a surprise to him because of the experience last time with the energy-enhancing fruit. After all, the agility-enhancing fruit was basically the same as the energy-enhancing fruit except for the color. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked over the clean agility-enhancing fruit, and took a bite. “Hmm, it’s pretty crispy, but I don’t taste anything.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that it was an excellent fruit, although tasteless. He quickly finished the agility-enhancing fruit, and ate another one since Qing Shui knew that he had to refine it later. </p>
  <p>“Last time I felt a wave of warmth after eating the energy-enhancing fruit. Why is there no feeling this time?” Confused, Qing Shui sat on the ground, and activated his Ancient Strengthening Technique. </p>
  <p>Just when Qing Shui was wondering why there was no reaction, a wave of clear qi rose from his abdomen and spread all around his body. That comfortable feeling was like walking out of sludge. </p>
  <p>The three million and six hundred thousand of his pores all felt great.</p>
  <p>“This feels so much better than when I ate the energy-enhancing fruit.” </p>
  <p>“My body indeed feels much lighter.” He took a step, a casual step, but this step stunned Qing Shui because this step was about twice the distance as a regular step. That feeling was excitement! So fast, so far, so profound!</p>
  <p>“This is the effect of the agility-enhancing fruit!” Qing Shui could clearly feel that his body was lighter, as if he thrown away a heavy package. His entire body was filled with power!</p>
  <p>“Speed is strength, but now I know how it feels. I could only comprehend before that a faster speed would increase the strength of a hit, but if I did not experience it myself like I did today, I really wouldn’t understand how deeply it could affect me!” Qing Shui was pleasantly surprised, as if he stolen another man’s wife.</p>
  <p>He plucked all eight fruits to prevent them from taking the place of future fruits. After all, a hundred years later he would get ten more!</p>
  <p>Next Qing Shui walked around the spatial realm for a bit. He would need time to get used to the sudden doubling of his speed. </p>
  <p>He first tried to walk, then slowly jog, run, and sprint. There were many time when Qing Shui almost fell, or crashed into the barrier. </p>
  <p>When Qing Shui could finally barely use his speed right now for ghostly steps, three days had passed in the spatial realm. The pot of delicious turtle soup was already in Qing Shui’s stomach. </p>
  <p>He thought about that fragrant smell. The taste which was like the ambrosia of the immortals, and was comparable to sucking Shi Qingzhuang’s saliva when he was kissing her. This clearly showed just how delicious the taste of the turtle soup was. </p>
  <p>Grudgingly, Qing Shui caught another turtle, broke apart it’s shell, removed its internal organs, and obtained its meat again. Compared to the first time, Qing Shui was much more skilled, and his speed was much quicker. </p>
  <p>When Qing Shui exited the spatial realm, the time outside had not even been four hours. Qing Shui held the pot and slowly walked towards Shi Qingzhuang’s room. </p>
  <p>He walked in the room quietly. </p>
  <p>Shi Qingzhuang was still in a deep slumber, her brows wrinkled. Her expression seemed as if she could wake up any moment. Qing Shui put the pot, along with a bowl and a small spoon, and placed them on the wooden table in the room. </p>
  <p>After setting the food down, Qing Shui slowly walked next to the bed and sat down sideways, and quietly gazed at Shi Qingzhuang. He knew he would probably never have this kind of opportunity again, so he decided to take advantage of it. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui wanted to gaze at her this way forever, but another thought told him to leave. He didn’t know why he would have that thought, but he felt that was the right thing to do. </p>
  <p>Just when Qing Shui decided to leave, he glanced at the the weak and delicate Shi Qingzhuang on the bed. Qing Shui was worried that a bad person or beast would enter the room and make him feel regret for the rest of his life.<br></p>
  <p>It was just that Qing Shui felt unrest in his heart. He was scared of what she would do when she awoke because of the way that he treated her, especially since she had a fiance. In addition, she was drugged with aphrodisiac by her fiance, and was taken away halfway during her escape…</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If her stupid fiance talked nonsense in Hundred Miles city, Shi Qingzhuang’s reputation might be lost. However, he most likely wouldn’t spread the rumor. Qing Shui was just hoping that the people around him wouldn’t talk.</p>
  <p>When he saw Shi Qingzhuang’s clothes lying around the bed, from outerwear to undergarment, Qing Shui slowly tidied up her belongings. He picked up Shi Qingzhuang’s undergarment, a small and shiny silk-like fabric. Although it was nothing outrageous from his past life, like lace or a thong, it still made a man’s blood vessels expand. </p>
  <p>The blanket just could not cover the sexy curves of Shi Qingzhuang’s naked body, and Qing Shui had a complicated look as he stared at it. He didn’t want to own it just for a moment. He liked owning things forever, only for him, especially when it involved women. No one can take away his woman after he claimed ownership, unless the woman didn’t love him and left voluntarily. </p>
  <p>While Qing Shui indulged himself in his fantasy, Shi Qingzhuang on the bed opened her pair of clear eyes. </p>
