 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was startled. This wasn’t the first time he had encountered such matters. There was actually a faint trace of aura surrounding her that didn’t resemble humans. She could be considered a demon immortal. A powerful demon immortal would also not be able to hide all of its aurae completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Legend has it that for demon immortals who reached the Divine realm or were at the peak of False God, they could shed off 50% of their demonic qi and start to transform into a life form resembling humans. But even so, there would still be some traces of demonic beasts characteristics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were some mystical traits of the demonic beast race. Not all demonic races could transform into humans. An example was the mermaid tribe. They were among the extremely rare few who could do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought back to his previous world where legends about the world of immortals existed. They said that all kinds of demonic beasts, no matter how inconsequential, would eventually be able to transform into humans once their cultivation reached a high enough level. The powerful demon beasts of this World of the Nine Continents couldn’t completely transform into humans. At most they could only change their size and their external appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Qing Shui even thought about whether there might be humans cultivating demonic techniques which caused their aura to leave a trace of demonic qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were no humans who had demonic qi in this world. Even if they cultivated some unusual techniques, as long as they were humans, they wouldn’t be able to produce demonic qi. Those who cultivate the demonic arts had a completely different aura compared to real demonic beasts. One was just an external demonic aura, while the other was a demonic aura that came directly from one’s bones and soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked over subconsciously. He picked up the dishes on his table and sat down opposite to the female in the conical hat as he spoke, “May I sit here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Qing Shui asked the question, he had already sat down and was staring straight at that female. Despite her wearing a conical bamboo hat, her beautiful features could still be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you already sitting down? You are so rude.” An elegant voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already disguised his features, although he wasn’t afraid to show her how he looked. He stared at the woman, wanting to figure which point of her was different compared to other humans but he was soon disappointed. He wasn’t able to see through anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui glanced at the woman again, he felt a faint killing intent. The cultivation base of this woman was very strong, and it wasn’t out of place for her to exude killing intent. After all, he kept staring at her and as a woman, she would naturally not be happy with that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don't have other intentions, Miss, please calm your anger. I only sensed a trace of extraordinary immortal qi from your body and was feeling very curious.” Qing Shui didn’t know what to say. The woman must have thought he was a wastrel or a hoodlum from his behavior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After speaking, he felt an even stronger killing intent, but that dissipated in an instant. Right now, even with the conical bamboo hat, Qing Shui could feel the woman surveying him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal qi. To put it nicely, it was immortal qi, but it could also be referred to as demonic qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui spoke, he started to eat his food. It felt as though he only wanted to say this. The woman stared, then she re-evaluated this stranger. She was shocked that even though she was only emitting a tiny amount of demonic qi, this man in front of her could still sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know what you are talking about.” The woman’s voice turned cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I said I have no malicious intentions. I’m just curious and wished to ask you for help.” Qing Shui smiled. If he guessed right, this woman most probably was a part of the Aqua Race, the mermaid tribe. In that case, she might be someone from the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, why should I help you?” The woman didn’t confirm nor deny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought about it and couldn’t think of a reason why she must help him. He paused for a while before continuing, “I’m a doctor. I can owe you a favor, and as long as that patient you wished for me to save has a breath of life left, I would be able to save him. I wonder if this condition works for you or not?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was surprised. She thought for a while and spoke, “I will temporarily believe in you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman actually felt that Qing Shui wasn’t someone who spoke without thinking. She also didn’t know why she trusted him, but in any case, she wouldn’t suffer any temporary losses. If she didn’t feel like helping him, she could always find an excuse and push him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have a friend who went to the Sea King Palace in the Ice Ocean Domain. Could you help me locate her?” Qing Shui hesitated for a while before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he was only speculating about the identity of this woman and wasn’t sure if she was actually apart of the Aqua Race or not. After he spoke, Qing Shui was filled with anticipation regarding her answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water regions of this world were more inferior compared to those living on land and both sides had never interfered in each other’s businesses. The main reason was that there were a vast majority of ordinary humans and Aquatics; they had no way leaving their natural environment and this was the main reason for the peace between the two races in the world. Ordinary humans would at most come into contact with the water to take a swim or fish for food, but It was different for experts. Experts from the human race or the Aqua Race might infiltrate the water or land environments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But these were all the minority, and they wouldn’t really look for a battle neither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was very quiet, as she slowly ate her food. She didn’t even raise her head when she replied, “Just because I have this trace of demonic qi in me, you think that I’m part of the Aquatics?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truth to be told, I’m only guessing. If Miss is unable to help me, just forget my request. It’s been a long time since I met such a pretty girl. Just treat it like I can’t hold back and came to speak with you today.” Qing Shui could always just wait for his Poison Dragon Flower to mature and his strength to improve before he went to search himself. He already had a spirit fish in any case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This time, it can be considered that you found the right person, but I don’t know who you want to look for. I have some connections and can help you look around.” The woman slowly spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart leaped with joy but he was a little cautious. After thinking awhile, he took out a portrait of Yiye Jiange and placed it on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman glanced at the portrait before she exclaimed in astonishment, “Who are you and why are you looking for her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t feel any anger when she saw the astonished expression of the woman. After contemplating a while, he decided to honestly reply, “I’m looking for her because she is my wife.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your wife? Stop lying. Why would she fall in love with you?” The female acted like she just heard the funniest thing in the world and started laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew this was because he was currently in disguise but he was not very happy with the woman’s attitude. “Why can’t she fall in love with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you think your age is a bit too old? I’ve seen the drawing of her husband before.” The woman laughed lightly. It felt like she had already seen through Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui knew this woman noticed that the face he was wearing wasn’t showing his true features. He then smiled and said, “Seems like Miss is already beginning to trust me. You should know her, can you bring me to see her?”</span></p>
