  <p><strong>AST 0072 – Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique</strong></p>
  <p><i><span style>Hehehe, yet another good thing.</span></i></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui salivated. This sudden burst of happiness caught him unawares. Happiness did indeed occurred at unexpected moments!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just looking over the name caused Qing Shui to be awed. He was sure that this needle technique definitely had connections with the &lt;&lt;Ancient Technique: Flames of Yin-Yang&gt;&gt;. Could all the techniques that were unlocked use the Ancient Strengthening Technique as their base? Are they able to complement each other to perfection.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let’s take a look first. Not counting this, the techniques I unlocked today: Alchemy and the Ancient Yin-Yang Flame technique, were already sufficient for me to benefit through my whole life.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It was not a mistake to immerse myself in gaming hahaha. Thank you, [Western Fantasy]!” Qing Shui grinned.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, what the… this is a set of acupuncture technique!” Qing Shui was startled. Initially, he thought that this was a set of attacking techniques, but who would have thought that it was a set of acupuncture techniques instead!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Ancient Strengthening Technique, wants me to treat illnesses?” Puzzlement shone in his eyes, as he continued scanning the unlocked information.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Primal Chaotic Divine Needle technique, was one of the original acupuncture techniques that existed back in the ancient times. One uses the Qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique as a base. Using the energy emitted by the Yin-Yang Flame, or otherwise known as the Primordial Fire, one can complement it with this particular set of needle technique to treat the illness and injuries of immortals and demons!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you fucking serious? So overpowered!” Qing Shui almost drooled again, he definitely have to invest the time in learning this set of needle technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>What are the problems that occurred most for Cultivators?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Injury, was one of the most common things that a cultivator would face. That was partly the reason why medical doctors and alchemists were such revered positions in this world of the nine continents. If one was able to let an extremely powerful cultivator owe you a favor, couldn’t that also be considered a form of wealth?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Now, I could be barely considered an Alchemist I suppose. Although I can only concoct the Golden Ointment, in the future I am sure to be a peerless alchemist. Every alchemist would start out as an outstanding doctor, as only doctors would be familiar with the effects and characteristics of various medicinal pills and ingredients.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was really akin to being sent charcoal in the midst of a snowstorm! This surprise was just too unexpected, and the happiness that came about was too sudden. Six years… For 6 years, he had no hints of any breakthroughs. To think that now he would suddenly be entreated with so many godly techniques and knowledge. If this was a form of compensation, then Qing Shui felt he was extremely pleased with it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The technique of the Primal Chaotic Divine Needle, the method of qi circulation, the acupoints, and the information about treatment for various illnesses flooded his mind. At this moment, Qing Shui could truly feel the awesomeness and mysteriousness of this particular set of needle technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui in the sea of consciousness, envisioned faint shadows of two golden needles into existence, and slowly practiced. </span></p>
  <p><i><span style>How awesome is the sea of consciousness? I could create something out of nothing?</span></i></p>
  <p><span style>“Come, give me a beauty to hug!” Qing Shui lustily called out!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ai, there was no response… Could it be that it only worked for things that would aid him in comprehending the techniques unlocked……</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The techniques unlocked could really be complemented, and the agility and nimbleness gained from practicing the Solitary Rapid Fist, were all displayed. They were all tremendously effective in aiding him in the understanding and usage of the Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Luck, was a type of skill too. This saying was verified by Qing Shui now. Were it not for his first bout of enlightenment, in which he mastered the essence of the Solitary Rapid Fist, then it wouldn’t have been so easy for him to train in the Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The needle technique, other than curing illness, could also ignite the potential of one’s talent, smoothen qi flow, aid in recovery, strengthen the body and quality of Yuan energy…</span></p>
  <p><span style>An unknown amount of time passed, and Qing Shui gradually started to awaken from that special state. He discovered that he still stood in the training hall at the peak level of the Night Fragrance Court, which was also the last place he remembered when Wenren Wu-Shuang lightly knocked his head.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ai, what’s that smell, so unpleasant!” Qing Shui glanced around his surroundings, before focusing on his body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“F*ck! This is Impurities Cleansing again!?” There was a grey layered of oil-like substances seeping out of Qing Shui’s pores.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After exclaiming in delight, Qing Shui proceeded to strip naked, but just as he was about to enter the heated pool, Wenren Wu-Shuang arrived as she stared blankly at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“HELP! There’s a pervert!!” Qing Shui shrieked, before swiftly jumping inside the pool.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You… What are you saying!” Wenren Wu-Shuang probably wished that a hole would open up right now for her to hide inside.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Especially when she saw the thing dangling in between his legs, causing her cheeks to bloom with the redness of a sunset, shining with a strange radiance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah,” Qing Shui sobbed. “You have already seen my everything, how am I going to marry in the future! “ Qing Shui, putting on an appearance of extreme grief, and looked at Wenren Wu-Shuang as if he was just raped in the ass by 3 to 5 burly men.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This… You naughty child, why did you strip naked without checking your surroundings, I still have yet to pursue this, you… You are a hooligan!” Wenren Wu-Shuang panicked. After all, she was a female, and that scene of Qing Shui naked, kept on appearing in her mind, unable to be wiped clean.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui proceeded to finish washing himself. He of course, was very happy, although Wenren Wu-Shuang had unintentionally saw him naked, so what, he didn’t suffer any losses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In his previous world, scientific records showed that 80% of males and females, after seeing the opposite sex’s naked bodies, would have some nefarious intentions…</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, could you help me to pass my clothes over first?” After washing himself, Qing Shui realized that his clothes were actually placed far away from the pool, so now, he could only helplessly beseech the help of this ravishing beauty, what a rare opportunity indeed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang froze as she glanced strangely at Qing Shui with a hidden bitterness in her eyes, before stomping her feet towards the pile of clothing and picking it up.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A wave of a manly smell whiffed straight into the nasal passages of Wenren Wu-Shuang, causing her already red cheeks to redden even further, accentuating her beauty even more.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You wretched kid, you better call me elder sister. If not I won’t pass you the set of clothes. I all my life, I have never passed clothing to any man before.” Wenren Wu-Shuang said in a complicated tone of voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui startled, but he somewhat understood what Wenren Wu-Shuang was saying, as a slight wave of disappointment rose in his heart, but swiftly, this feeling was pushed aside to the back of his mind. He understood that it was normal. He was nothing now, how could someone at the Xiantian level fall for him?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Nevermind, with efforts, one can achieve anything. There was no rush, the current him already enjoyed plenty of advantages. Chasing girls needed time and efforts too!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Can I call you little sister instead?” Qing Shui asked, as grief clouded his features.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Nope, you wretched kid, hurry up and call me respectfully, if not I will throw your clothes away. At that point in time, I wonder how you would be able to leave here then.” Wenren Wu-Shuang blinked her eyes as she said, somewhat adorably.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Elder sister be obedient okay, please pass me back my clothes…”</span></p>
