 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the two girls also didn’t know how they should describe Qing Shui. A powerful warrior, physician as well as an alchemist. Yu Xixuan even knew that he was able to make good food, even more professional than what a professional cook could prepare. What else did he know? The two girls had started to feel curious about this man. How could a person be so good in so many things?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the two girls remembered what Qing Shui said before: ‘There weren’t any alchemists more powerful than myself’. He seemed to be telling the truth. Beiming Xue blushed. Before this, she even said that he was being arrogant…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t look at me like that. I am married,” Qing Shui said as he put his arms around his own shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” The two girls were in tune when it came to that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, I’ll be making some food now,” Yu Xixuan smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “There is no need for that; I can prepare it anytime I want. Let’s eat something different tonight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui finished speaking, he took out a table and chairs along with some pans and pots. There was the Violet Claypot from last time. The chopsticks and bowls he took out were made of Jade Stones. Following on, Qing Shui took out some fishes from the realm. This included the Rainbow Trout Fish and turtles. Other than just fish dishes, he also prepared some fresh and delicious tortoise soup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely its taste had already surprised the girls. In any case, Yu Xixuan already knew that he was good at cooking. Hence, he felt that there was no need for him to hide it. Besides, if he established a good relationship with Beiming Xue, Luan Luan would also receive even more care from the Northern Underworld Immortal Palace. Even though Luan Luan might be strong, she had yet to accumulate enough practical experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three sat together to have their dinner, the two girls were silent almost the whole time. They were eating very quickly. Despite all that, they still looked very elegant; beautiful women, this was how they were. Even if the way they ate was a bit vulgar, they would still look cute. Just like the saying: ‘If a beautiful woman acted vulgarly, that was considered as charming. If an ugly woman was to do the same, she would be regarded as a manly woman.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls only stopped eating when they were full. They still seemed like they wanted to eat more while looking at the table. Unfortunately, their stomach wouldn’t allow them to stuff anymore in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s too delicious! Qing Shui! Thanks to you, I am so full now!” Beiming Xue looked at Qing Shui with a grumpy look and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart thumped. “This woman… Please don’t look at me with those eyes…” This woman’s magnanimity was indescribable. If he was to describe her with terms from his previous incarnation, she would be at the level of a goddess. For a woman to have such a bitter look, it was as if Qing Shui acted irresponsibly after having sex with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you feel happy after letting me improve the quality of your meals?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Happy, I am very happy. However, what shall I do in the future? I am scared that I might starve to death!” Beiming Xue looked even more bitter now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui avoided eye contact with her as he didn’t dare to look at her directly. Furthermore, he feared that his bones would become soft.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can first start by not drinking water for half a month or maybe a bit longer and fill your stomach only with fruits. After a while, when you start eating again, you will find the food that you eat to be unusually delicious, so much that it might even taste better than what you ate today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was telling the truth. He could also pull this off in his previous incarnation. For example, he could try not eating anything but fruits for three days. After that, he could start by eating some foods and vegetables at an appropriate amount. By then, the food which he ate would taste unusually delicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t care. Make sure to fill my stomach this whole month!” Beiming Xue rolled her eyes and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui admitted that he had a pure thought. However, what she said still made his heart thump. What did she mean by making sure to fill her stomach this month? Eat him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Beiming Xue wouldn’t know about the thought of sleeping together. Or else, she would definitely have lost control over herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan smiled and said nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beiming Xue looked at Yu Xixuan, “Sister Xuan, you seemed to be not surprised at all. Does it mean that you don’t want to eat the food that he makes in the future?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, I am also able to make the food which he prepared. Big Brother Shui has given me quite a lot of ingredients. I can also make food that tastes just as good as his.” Yu Xixuan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. To think that there were also times when women would be so flirty. Who would have expected that she would call him Big Brother Shui? This was a very mature and charming woman. However, that feat of hers was just a kind of gracefulness. Most of the time, she looked cold and proud, but without herself noticing; sometimes, she would also emit a kind of enchanting and sexy charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Beiming Xue heard what she said, she moved her sight onto Qing Shui, “You mustn’t be so biased. I am also your friend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and said, “She is my woman.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, hey, hey! Don’t talk nonsense! I am not!” Yu Xixuan blushed and shot a glare at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she stayed quiet about it, Beiming Xue would definitely be convinced that they were in that kind of relationship with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What I mean, is that we have joined forces. In a way, we can be considered as allies. What were you thinking about?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan knew that she had been fooled by this man. She muttered out a few words, “You stingy man…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beiming Xue looked at Qing Shui before glancing towards Yu Xixuan. She remained silent. Eventually, Qing Shui smiled and said, “Alright, alright, I will give you some ingredients once we are out of here. I still have quite a few of them stored with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Beiming Xue revealed a satisfied smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his previous incarnation, food was the God of people. Actually, this was the same everywhere he went. Even though it was not necessary for warriors to eat every day, they couldn’t get their life away from food. A lot of warriors would have three meals a day. To be truthful, every time they got to eat was a kind of contentment to them. It was an experience to taste different kinds of food from different places. A lot of people pursued good food like they pursued beautiful women. Food and sex were the two most important things in a person’s life. The former could guarantee a person to continue living; the latter, on the other hand, ensured that life could be passed on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without realizing it, three days passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these few days, they would gather with the others every day. They would also try to find treasures themselves. Everyone had managed to gain quite a few decent stuff. However, there was a person who got injured, but he was the person who gained the most benefits. He managed to tame a Spiritual Beast, the Violet Flame Ice Snow Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Spiritual Beast with ice and fire attributes. Its strength was at the level of Divine Grade, and its overall ability was unspecified. The amount of strength, which it was able to unleash, surpassed even warriors at the mid-stage of the Seventh level of Divinity.</span></p>

The reason why he was able to tame this Spiritual Beast was because he had a legendary Beast-Taming Immortal Talisman in his hand. With that, he had earned a fortune from this trip. Merely a Violet Flame Ice Snow Beast was enough to make his trip worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Violet Flame Ice Snow Beast was a Spiritual Beast. Its defensive prowess, as well as its speed, allowed it to surpass many ordinary demonic beasts. Aside from having two attributes, it was able to use Ice Flame Burst which was very powerful. It was also very strong in using its five elements. When combined with Xicheng Tianlong, its ability in actual combat could be said to be unbeatable among warriors at the mid-stage of the Seventh level of Divinity. Even warriors who just broke through to the late-stage of the Seventh level of Divinity wouldn’t stand a chance against him.</span></p>

Its entire body was white, and only all four of its paws were violet in color; they were flaring with the violet flame. Its head resembled a dragon as there was a horn growing out of it. Its tail was like the tail of a snake. It was incomparably thick and seemed to be two times longer than its body. The tail was almost a hundred meters long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Beiming Xue and Yu Xixuan saw the Violet Flame Ice Snow Beast, they couldn’t help but stare in admiration. After all, Spiritual Beasts of the like were very hard to tame. The higher intelligence a Spiritual Beast possessed, the harder it was to be tamed. Unless it let the person tame it on its own will or the person trying to tame it had some extraordinary power.</span></p>

However, they also got quite a few ores and killed some strong demonic beasts. That was all they got. They didn’t receive anything particularly good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, there is a cave in front of us.” Beiming Xue pointed forward.</span></p>

In the beginning, the empty area that they found wasn’t considered a cave; thus, it was excluded from it. Strictly speaking, this was the first cave which they entered, which was also why Beiming Xue was so agitated and happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go and take a look. However, we must stay alert as we have already entered the dangerous region.” Qing Shui reminded them before leading them ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I can sense the aura of a demonic beast.” Qing Shui stopped and looked at the cave entrance. The aura which he felt came out precisely from that place.</span></p>
