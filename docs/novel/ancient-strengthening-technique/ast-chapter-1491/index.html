 <p><strong>AST 1491 - Linhai City and the Young Master of Hua Clan </strong></p>
 <p>Everyone was limited to consuming ten pills, and only one pill per year.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Six-Yang Pills. They were many times better than the Five-Yang Pills. The Five-Yang Pill could only increase power by three sun, but the Six-Yang Pills were capable of increasing power by ten sun. This was over threefold the effect of the Five-Yang Pill.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Five-Yang Pill was just threefold of the Four-Yang Pills. It turned out the effects this time were more than threefold because of the pill condensation at the end. Qing Shui kept the Six-Yang Pills and continued refining.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Normally, Qing Shui would only refine successful medicine, and he would always refine them without fail no matter how difficult it was. This might have been one of the strengths of the Ancient Alchemy Technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui took a break after each refinement and only stopped after two days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and sufficient pills had been produced, then he took four Six-Yang pills at once.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, something unexpected happened, but it was something unexpectedly good. The Six-Yang Pills increased his strength more than they were supposed to.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Each Pill increased his strength by around twenty-five sun, but this was not completely unexpected, because it was stated that it might have special effects on certain people. It was possible for its effects to be amplified a few fold.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It turned out to be twofold for him. This was considered good, considering the bonus effects had been limited previously. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui speculated that he could consume all of the Six-Yang Pills after one month. By then, if things went according to plan, his power would increase by more than a thousand Sun.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's current base power was only a little over four hundred Sun. This power-up would be a twenty-five percent increase in power and Qing Shui was very satisfied with it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His body was special because of the Paragon Heavenly Technique and the Hell Nightmare Beast. This allowed him to greatly increase his body's strength and durability. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was about time. Qing Shui washed himself up, had a change of clothes and left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The sun was already up by the time he came out, and everyone else was already up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui had come out, Yin Tong told the hotel staff to bring breakfast up. To them, there was no need to eat every meal. Meals were not a practice, but more of an indulgence. Of course, even small portions would be enough to replenish energy. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What are we doing today?" Yin Tong asked Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Let's go to Ice Ocean Domain." In the end, Qing Shui ran out of patience and decided to go take a look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ice Domain Dynasty was rumored to have the strength of a Peak False God, and the Ice Ocean Domain was said to be even scarier than these dynasties. This was why Qing Shui would not recklessly enter the Ice Ocean Domain and the Sea King's Palace.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange would not have done so as well, especially since it had been more than one year since she had went. There was no reason to go there now. With some patience, they might be able to meet Yiye Jiange soon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui always suspected that Yiye Jiange's origins had some connection with the Sea King's Palace. It might turn out to be something good, but it still made him uneasy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>No one would object since it was Qing Shui who said it. They began setting out towards the Ice Ocean Domain, and it got colder as they ventured further up north. Linhai City was the most northern major city in the Ice Domain Dynasty, so the temperatures here were unimaginably low.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All the buildings here were made of ice. The weather here was so cold it could crack rocks. Everything outside the pavilion was frozen solid, and there were only a few rocks inside. In Qing Shui’s previous life, buildings were only one or two feet thick, but buildings here were tens of meters thick. And these were only normal buildings; larger buildings would be thick beyond imagination.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was unexpectedly warm inside the building, just like the inn Qing Shui stayed in. Everything in here seemed to feel majestic or artistic to Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ice Ocean Domain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They had arrived at the Ice Ocean Domain in no time. Of course, this was with the use of the Nine Continent Steps.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned when he first saw the Ice Ocean Domain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As far as they could see, there were crowds everywhere. Oceans this big never froze, just like in his previous life. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were numerous boats on the sea. Most of them were fishing boats of the sort, living off the land. Everything here was sustained by the Ice Ocean Domain itself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, the Ice Domain Dynasty did not rely totally on the things in the water. Some plants were suitable to be grown even in cold places like this and there were countless treasures in freezing places. There were also wild beasts and demons which could provide humans with resources.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As they stood on the beach and watched the crystal-clear sea, because there was a limit to their powers, naturally some things in the depths could not be seen by them. The Sea King's Palace would be deep down in the ocean.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On land and in the sea, the palaces here were both called the Sea King's Palace. But there was a clear difference between them, the one on land was called the Ice Ocean Domain Sea King's Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But the Sea King's Palace in the sea was more mysterious. The huge fishing boats floated on the sea, reeling up countless different types of fish and turtles. Qing Shui asked around about the existence of a Sea King's Palace in the Ice Ocean Domain. All of them answered rather humorously. "Yes, everyone knows it exists. But I've never seen it personally."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that asking civilians would not get him anywhere. The Ice Ocean Domain was so vast, deep, and dangerous, that even if someone of Qing Shui's level were to go and search for the palace, it would be like finding the needle in a haystack. In other words, it would be a completely fruitless effort.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui forgot about it for now. In the meantime, the thought they should focus on increasing their power, to then feel better about going to the Sea King's Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui decided to stay here and lay low. This place was considered developed for a beach area. Many strong people would stay in places like this, rather than staying in the city.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In fact, Linhai City was once the capital, but the capital moved to where it was now, just next to Linhai City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Half a day passed by in the blink of an eye. Looking at the people bustling around, somehow Qing Shui felt a sense of peace. The people were like ants, each busy with his own work just like the nest of ants Qing Shui was staring at.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked up to the sky. Maybe someone up there was looking at him like how he looked at the ants on the ground. The thought of crushing them with his fingers did not even cross his mind, because it was not relevant at all. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Let's go. Time to look for a place to stay again. We are still gonna open up our clinic. We have to get a taste of a peaceful life." Qing Shui laughed and began leading the way towards a big street.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Linhai Street!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though the place was called Linhai Street, it was actually quite far away from the Ice Ocean Domain. The place was about a hundred meters above sea level and dozens of miles from the sea.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The eyesight of a warrior was scary. It could not even be compared with the vision of an average person in the previous life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ice Domain Dynasty was just as bustling as the Great Xia Dynasty but the people were much stronger. The cold climate here made the people living here stronger and more durable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was an adaptation to their surroundings. Things living in harsher conditions would always be stronger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After some exploring, not many houses were available for rent but there were numerous inns. They could stay and eat there, but it would be a problem to open a clinic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was loaded. The money in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was already more than enough. He realized that he did not spend much, and almost always, what he wanted could not be bought. Here, the phrase "money is everything" only applied to normal people. To strong warriors, money was useless.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The four strolled aimlessly, gazing at the surroundings, stopping to chat and laughing whenever something piqued their interest. It was pretty carefree.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Young Master, it's them. Look at the clothes they're wearing. They're not from here. And look at the two beautiful women. See? I wasn't lying to Young Master." Someone suddenly exclaimed. Qing Shui's senses were sharp. He could tell that the person was referring to them. One look at the person and his guess was confirmed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he had once again encountered the “Profligate Sons”, which every city had. Qing Shui was not sure how good for nothing these wastrels could be, or if they even had the right to be good for nothing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The people around them started to move away. Around twenty people appeared and surrounded Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The one in the middle was a handsome young man. Somehow “handsome” was not befitting for him. His fair skin and gleaming eyes made him somewhat charming.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even with his lean body, Qing Shui could tell that this was a man standing before him, yet this man was almost comparable with a woman. The only difference was that he had no breasts; even his waist and thighs looked like a female's.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A man raised to such monstrosity gave Qing Shui a bad feeling. Calling him charming was nice but slightly disingenuous. In reality, calling him a sissy would have been more fitting.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hua Ershao was the second son of the Hua clan of Linhai City, also known as Young Master Huahua. With his background and his decent talent in cultivation, he was one of the most famous wastrels of Linhai City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A rumor saying that he was a fake man spread around Linhai City and somehow managed to reach this rascal's ears. Since then, his personality made a complete U-turn, even assaulting women in the open streets just to prove that he was a real man.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although he looked like a woman, Hua Ershao was indeed a man. Because of cultivation, his strength as a man was not weak. In addition to that&nbsp;,he had his backgrounds and his good traits. Most women compromised because of their fear towards the Hua clan and in the end, Hua Ershao had never failed to get any woman.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He would do anything to get a woman he had set his eyes on. If he was in Qing Shui's world, he would have been diagnosed with a disease.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Where do you come from, my fair ladies? You don't seem like you are from around here." The young man said charmingly with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"There are millions of people in Linhai City, do you know all of them?" &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The young man choked upon hearing Qing Shui's words and scorned angrily,"I wasn't talking to you. Don't interrupt me!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah, how dare you speak to our Young Master? You wanna die?" The men beside the young man began to shout.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. These people were looking for trouble.&nbsp;</p>
