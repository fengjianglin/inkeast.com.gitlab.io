 <p><strong>AST 681 - Di Qing’s inner thoughts</strong></p>
 <p>“Am I such a low-life in your eyes?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Di Qing dejectedly. Ever since he had scolded her for being a ‘foolish woman’, she seldom missed the opportunity to make fun of him. It seemed like she still took it to heart even after such a long time.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he was the only one subject to this kind of a treatment from her. This made Qing Shui a little depressed.</p>
 <p>“Of course not! Our Qing Shui is an outstanding talent, one truly strong and valiant. I think very highly of you.” Di Qing laughed out.</p>
 <p>Di Qing appeared easy going and seemingly true to herself in front of Qing Shui, she even acted like a ‘little woman’ at times. Her temperament and rare beauty helped her retain her elegance and poise, giving her an overwhelming aura of nobility.</p>
 <p>“Fine. I was wrong before, I shouldn’t have called you a foolish woman. You’re actually a very kind-hearted and virtuous lady, one with a beauty which can overturn a state. Miss Di can you please forgive me? I am just an ordinary folk and you’re the Jade girl of Lake Yao. Please let me off.” Qing Shui said with a smile. He wasn’t actually that concerned, but he still decided to apologize when this topic was brought up. He realized that she had been troubled by his comment and knew that it was necessary for him to explain himself…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of something, but he just shook his head. He might still meet her often in the future so he wished to interact with her normally.</p>
 <p>Di Qing blushed and humphed, “Those are just empty words, you don’t think that way, but that last statement was true though. Do you really hate me that much?” Di Qing finished her sentence sounding downcast.</p>
 <p>Her previous smile had disappeared and she gave Qing Shui a complicated look.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was puzzled by Di Qing’s reaction and immediately explained, “You’re overthinking this, how could I possibly hate you? I am being honest. Anyways, who would hate the prettiest woman in Seven Stars City? I’m really quite honored to know you…”</p>
 <p>“You’re lying!” Di Qing whispered as her expression regained its composure.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s just agree to coexist peacefully then, okay?” Qing Shui quickly jumped to his main point.</p>
 <p>“Then promise me that you’ll always give way to me. Also, if you have any good items, you’ll have to remember to share them with me.” Di Qing replied after some consideration.</p>
 <p>“Of course, we are relatives!” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Okay, then let me ask you something. You must be honest though.” Di Qing gave it some thought and spoke seriously.</p>
 <p>“Sure, I will be honest with you.” Qing Shui replied blatantly. He knew that it wouldn’t be easy to answer truthfully. In any case, she wouldn’t know even if he wasn’t being honest.</p>
 <p>“Will you think of me sometimes?” Di Qing asked softly.</p>
 <p>Di Qing had always liked to compare herself with Di Chen from a very young age. She would like whatever Di Chen liked and would covet anything that Di Chen had. Now, she felt very comfortable in Qing Shui’s presence.</p>
 <p>In the past, she had already thought highly of the man that her elder sister had fallen for. It was just that she felt he was a little young. Furthermore, she had also seen him before.</p>
 <p>After that, she slowly discovered that the man truly had a miraculous streak. He had incredible strength which allowed him to survive each time he underwent a life threatening situation. In addition, his strength had continuously increased at a spectacular rate.</p>
 <p>When both of them returned together to the Central Continent, she had spent a few months with him during the journey. They had even faced an awkward incident when Di Qing had been hugged and scolded by Qing Shui. The man had somehow already gained a place in her heart though that incident.</p>
 <p>She was anxious, so she forced herself to not think about it since Qing Shui was her brother-in-law. The matter with the Di Clan had triggered her heart, and her feelings for Qing Shui had begun to change.</p>
 <p>She felt that among the younger generation on Seven Stars Country, even those considered top geniuses weren’t qualified to compete with Qing Shui. She gradually realized that she had come to care about him and she started to tease him just to get noticed. She had always thought of herself as a very eligible bachelorette, but she felt that she had lost her previous attractiveness and confidence in front of this man.</p>
 <p>She believed that she was in no way lacking compared to her sister, Di Chen. He treated her sister so well, she was like a goddess to him. Yet when he looked at her, there wasn’t a hint of adoration even after turning from enemies to relatives.</p>
 <p>Human nature is as such, entangling themselves in this sort of odd reverse psychology. Di Qing knew that she didn’t feel this way because Qing Shui was cold to her. She was very rational, she knew what she should and shouldn’t do.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t aware of what Di Qing meant by those words. He saw Di Qing looking very out of it, as if she was engrossed in her own thoughts. He really didn’t know how he should be answering her.</p>
 <p>“Of course, I’ll think of you. We’re friends so it’s normal that I would think of you.” Qing Shui said softly after some consideration.</p>
 <p>“Are you always thinking of my sister?” Di Qing asked looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Even if he suddenly turned clueless about relationships, he could still tell what she meant. He looked dumbfounded at the beautiful woman who should’ve been calling him brother-in-law.</p>
 <p>“If, and I only mean if, you weren’t together with my sister...would you have...fallen for me?” Di Qing seemed to have difficulty saying these words, but she looked at Qing Shui bravely as her face started to blush.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really started to have headache now. Under normal circumstances, any man would be happy and elated. But there was no way he could be happy right now.</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about? You sound happy!” Di Chen, who happened to be nearby, just walked over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was relieved when he saw Di Chen approaching. He really did not know how to answer to Di Qing. From his perspective, he felt that he would’ve been wrong regardless of his response.</p>
 <p>“Sister, you’re here. It’s nothing, I was just calling Qing Shui over for dinner. We were talking about Xian’er. That little lass just got a load of good items from Qing Shui, she was so happy.” Di Qing laughed but felt a little guilty.</p>
 <p>“Okay. Let’s go have dinner. The food is getting cold.” Di Qing smiled and hurried them.</p>
 <p>The three of them walked towards the room, but Di Qing continued to blush whenever she unintentionally glanced at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui locked eyes with Di Chen occasionally during dinner, he felt as if her mesmerizing eyes could tell everything. He didn’t feel guilty however, he just felt that it wasn’t right.</p>
 <p>Di Qing left after they finished dinner, leaving only Di Chen and Qing Shui in the room.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Yuan Su agreed to let you treat her.” Di Chen smiled at Qing Shui. Her eyes were calm, but the smiling expression within them were exceptionally attractive.</p>
 <p>“Let me know if you are against it. I will reject it if that’s the case.” Qing Shui laughed and looked at Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“It’s none of my business. You should decide for yourself.” Di Chen displayed a look of annoyance.</p>
 <p>“Would you be upset?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I be upset? I wouldn’t be with you if I get upset over such a thing. I know that a bad guy like you already has a few other women.” Di Chen laughed as if she didn’t mind that Qing Shui was involved with quite a few other women.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui fell silent. He didn’t have the intention to actively pursue Di Chen from the very start. This was because he knew that he couldn’t grow old with just one woman. With the fact that he had other women, he felt that he didn’t deserve the right to pursue Di Chen. Even if he didn’t have other women, Qing Shui still felt that he wasn’t good enough for her. Initially, he had only respected her as a untouchable goddess, dismissing even a hint of profane thought.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui became silent, Di Chen reached out and massaged Qing Shui’s head, “Don’t be so small minded. It’s impossible that a capable man only have one woman. I am not blaming you, you’re an upright man after all. You must be confident, there is no one that can compete with you. You’re the best and most outstanding in my heart. I like you…”</p>
 <p>These few words spurred Qing Shui. The beauty of a woman could destroy cities. Qing Shui was experiencing the truth of that phrase now, he could give up a whole empire for this woman. Whether it was right or wrong, Qing Shui felt that she was worth it.</p>
 <p>When she spoke those last lines, saying how he was the best in her heart and that she liked him—Qing Shui felt that these plain words were like the voices of immortals when spoken from Di Chen’s mouth. He could die without any regrets.</p>
 <p>“Do you really mean that?” Qing Shui embraced her. He didn’t know how to show his love for her. He just hugged her tightly and hoped he could just assimilate her into his body or just consume her. He loved her so deeply that he didn’t know how to express it.</p>
 <p>“Ah, Qing Shui, don’t be so uncivilized.” Di Chen had already been forcibly kissed by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Chen’er, I feel that you’re just like an extremely seductive demon. Actually no, you’re an extremely mesmerizing goddess. I just want to eat you up.”</p>
 <p>His amorous words made Di Chen shy and happy at the same time. She reached up and pinched Qing Shui’s nose twice. She then laughed, even that was very alluring. One could drown in her beauty.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>Yuan Su came over in the afternoon. Even though Qing Shui had heard from Di Chen and Di Qing that she’d made a decision regarding the treatment, he could see that Yuan Su was visibly nervous.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what to say, it wasn’t appropriate to say anything so he just waited for her to start the conversation. Di Chen and Di Qing had left Qing Shui and Yuan Su to settle the matter.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui commented, “You’re here”, Yuan Su replied with, “Yes”. They didn’t exchange a word after that. Qing Shui was waiting for her to make the decision.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I decided that I want to receive treatment.” After a while, Yuan Su finally stated as she bit her lips.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was an opinionated woman. Once she made a decision, she would always follow through. However, this matter had troubled her for two days because she couldn’t think of any alternative solutions.</p>
 <p>“Let’s enter!” Qing Shui slowly said as he led her to the bedroom.</p>
 <p>Since she had already made her decision, Qing Shui didn’t say anything more. It was inappropriate to say anything more regarding such a matter. It was more important that he solved her issue.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su followed Qing Shui into the bedroom. Her heart started to race. This was a difficult decision for a woman like her, she stood to lose a lot. She was engulfed by the feelings of nervousness, loss and worry.</p>
 <p>When they were in the bedroom, Qing Shui said, “Please remove your clothes and lie down. I need to make some preparations. “</p>
 <p>Yuan Su’s heart started beat even faster. Even Qing Shui, who was two meters away from her, could hear her heartbeat.</p>
