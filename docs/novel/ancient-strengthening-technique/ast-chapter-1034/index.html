 <p><strong>AST 1034 Reunion, Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation Learned, Earth Diamond Bear, Beast Soul</strong></p>
 <p>Together with Qing Yu, the three of them left Buddha Mountain and flew toward Demon Gate. This time around, Qing Shui stood a slight distance away from them to allow Huoyun Liu-Li and Huoyun Peng to chat.</p>
 <p>The lass was carried by Huoyun Liu-Li, but she got familiar with Huoyun Peng very quickly. Huoyun Peng carried Qing Yu and was saying some things, occasionally crying and smiling.</p>
 <p>Father and daughter. They were father and daughter connected by blood and there was nothing which couldn't be resolved between them. Qing Shui stood a distance away and didn't try to listen to what they were saying, although, if he wished to, it would be a simple feat for someone of his cultivation level.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng would also occasionally looked at Qing Shui. He now knew how terrifying this young man was and even Buddha Sect wasn't able to fend him off. Or rather, even if they could fend him off, they would still have to pay a terrible price.</p>
 <p>"Father, what are your plans for the future?" Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng was stunned before he said, "After your mother and I were forced to give you away to someone else, we were both forcibly brought back by our families. We wanted to escape but weren't able to. Therefore, I've always put great effort into cultivating so that we can reunite in the future. Now that we're going to be reunited, I realize that I don't have any other plans. I just think that it'll be good that our family can be together."</p>
 <p>"Why don't you and mother stay at my foster parents' place for a while? They are also the people I love the most." Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"This is something we should do. Even if you didn't mention this, we'll still go. You're our daughter, but at the same time, you're also their daughter. We are all family." Huoyun Peng said solemnly.</p>
 <p>"Liu-Li is very happy to see that Father is a very responsible person. It has been so many years, but Liu-Li is considered lucky. I have my foster parents, Qing Shui, the Qing Clan, and now I have my parents and this little lass. Liu-Li feels that I'm the most blissful person in the world." Huoyun Liu-Li was speaking the truth. At this moment, she really felt very blessed.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>They arrived at Demon Gate very quickly. Qing Shui's Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had already become a symbol and no matter where it was, no one would dare to stop it. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant just directly flew towards the familiar location.</p>
 <p>They landed a distance away and then walked over. The old man and Mo Hongluo were already standing a distance away and looking at them. Although they were very far away, Qing Shui could still see that Mo Hongluo was very unease.</p>
 <p>This unease was a yearning, anxiety, and agitation...</p>
 <p>The old man walked over slowly and Huoyun Peng bowed respectfully to him, "Uncle!"</p>
 <p>"Hmph, Liu-Li is already calling me Grandfather." The old man seemed to be very dissatisfied.</p>
 <p>"Father-in-law!"</p>
 <p>"Alright, go over. Go have a good chat with Hongluo." The old man waved his hand.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng looked toward Huoyun Liu-Li and Qing Shui and nodded, before he walked toward Mo Hongluo uneasily.</p>
 <p>"Great-grandfather!" Qing Yu smiled and called the old man.</p>
 <p>"You're such a sweet little lass. It's hard for me not to adore you," the old man carried Qing Yu and said happily. At this moment, the love and joy on his face weren't mixed with any impurities at all. They were very pure feelings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very clear that although the lass was still young, she could get people to like her very easily. Her big crystal-like eyes made her appeared to be very intelligent, cute and showed her potential in being an imp.</p>
 <p>After very long, Huoyun Peng and Mo Hongluo walked over, their eyes still red. Right now, both of them were wearing a happy smile. Huoyun Liu-Li went up and held their hands.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Huoyun Liu-Li's tears were like a flowing river, trickling down her beautiful face which was like white jade.</p>
 <p>"Father, Mother!"</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng hugged his daughter and then Mo Hongluo.</p>
 <p>It wasn't early anymore and thus they stayed for dinner. Dinner was very sumptuous and everyone who came were all the direct descendants of Demon Gate. They were all Mo Hongluo's siblings. Of course, there were still a few members of the younger generation, but they were all the most outstanding in the clan.</p>
 <p>The old man had intentionally gotten everyone in the clan who had potential to get to know Qing Shui. Regardless, they were kin and were considered to be closer. Of course, how it was would be dependent on what Qing Shui thinks.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui clearly knew what was going on. The old man had given Liu-Li the Holy Bracelet and knew that the old man was considered to have put in a great investment. However, when compared with Buddha Sect, Qing Shui was more satisfied with how Demon Gate had dealt with the situation. At the very least, Demon Gate valued kinship more.</p>
 <p>Mo Zitong was around as well. He even had a few rounds of drinks with Qing Shui. He had placed down the burden in his heart as well. It wasn't because Qing Shui was his relative now, but was because Qing Shui had defeated Buddha Sect's Supreme Grand Elder. The two of them weren't on the same level.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui and Liu-Li were brought to the same manor, while Huoyun Peng naturally went to Mo Hongluo's place. The couple who had reunited after over 30 years would naturally have a lot of things to say. All the years of yearning...</p>
 <p>After dinner, Qing Shui just gave an excuse and left. No one said anything and Huoyun Liu-Li just casually mentioned that he had gone for his training. The others weren't astonished. For a young man to be so powerful, even if his talent surpassed that of others he would still need to put in hard work. This also stimulated some people from Demon Gate and the old man smiled as he watched them, not saying a word.</p>
 <p>Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again cultivated the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. In the five continents, there were too few people who could cultivate this. After chatting with Demon Gate's old man, Qing Shui also knew a little about it.</p>
 <p>Although there weren't many Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation’s in the five continents, there were many in the other four. Of course, the conditions required for cultivating this was the same and the people there would all pick this up when their spirit energy reached 10,000 stars. The secret manual to the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was exactly the same and as long as one was successful, he would be able to awaken something which was like a beast soul which could come in many forms and varieties. Their prowess would also be very different and of course, there would be people who had awakened the same beast soul.</p>
 <p>It might not necessarily be the case whereby an awakened lion was definitely stronger than a Jade Mouse. It was also not dependent on the size of the phantom image of the beast form after it was awakened. It was said that these were related to one's blood lineage, spirit energy, and martial techniques.</p>
 <p>Failure!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had become numb to this very long ago. However, he continued to try relentlessly, even using the Nature Energy and other things. After failing, he would sit down and read the description written in the manual.</p>
 <p>The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique flowed rapidly throughout his body. The force from the Shield attack and Nature Energy had a great explosive impact. Qing Shui meridian channels were basically all cleared, with the exceptions of some secret meridian channels he had no idea of. If he hadn't cleared a heavenly meridian by accident, he would never have known where they were positioned.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui suddenly felt that the heavenly meridians he had cleared seemed to be suddenly in pain. He channeled his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Suddenly, Qing Shui's State of Immovable as Mountains pulsated and his strong aura on his body also increased by a lot. Then, it felt as if something was going to be peeled off from his body.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>The "pellet" from the State of Immovable as Mountains suddenly increased by one-third. Qing Shui then felt an even more majestic force flowing out from it.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared blankly at the phantom image around him. It was a phantom image in a faint gold color. It was only three meters tall, but seemed very strong. It completely encompassed him</p>
 <p>To think that his beast soul had awakened the State of Immovable as Mountains...</p>
 <p>His consciousness gained an additional information.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Earth Diamond Bear!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned, but he hadn't expected that his 化兽(Demonic Beast Armor) was the Earth Diamond Bear. The Earth Diamond Bear was the king of all bear-typed demonic beasts, the strongest existence amongst all bear-typed demonic beasts. It was said that its might would not lose out even to legendary dragons and phoenixes.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui felt that dragons and phoenixes exist. He thought of the Nirvanic Fruit in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and how carefully the Fire Bird had guarded it and felt that dragons and phoenixes definitely exist in the World of the Nine Continents. It was just that in his previous life, these creatures had been treated as gods.</p>
 <p>In the ancient times, many demonic beasts were comparable to dragons and phoenixes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very agitated now. He hadn't expected that the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation he had awakened was the Earth Diamond Bear. The power of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation had no relation to its size, but had a greater relevance to the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation's blood lineage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly read on.</p>
 <p>Adolescent phase, increase strength and spirit energy by one fold.</p>
 <p>Once it was used, it would continue to deplete spirit energy!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. This was too powerful. And to think that this was only in the adolescent phase and his strength was increased to be twice as powerful. The best thing was that it was not applied to physical strength but overall strength. It seemed that if it becomes stronger, it'll also have powerful divine techniques. It was just that he didn't expect his beast soul to be an Earth Diamond Bear, something which might not appear once in a billion beast soul awakening.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't afraid that his spirit energy would be depleted. The rate at which his spirit energy recovery was much stronger than others. Moreover, his Yin-Yang Image was constantly circulating and recovering his spirit energy, tempering his muscles and bones as well as his internal organs. The Yin-Yang Image had given Qing Shui too much help.</p>
 <p>What had made Qing Shui the happiest, was that his spirit energy was not restricted by the world's pressure. This was good. He felt that he could head directly to Northern Sacred Lu Continent to deal with Lion King's Ridge.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui recalled the old man's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. Qing Shui didn't know what phase that phantom beast image was, but he could sense that his own would not lose out to the old man’s.</p>
 <p>In the time that followed, Qing Shui spent his time cultivating the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. The method to do so was very simple, which was to consistently use spirit energy to maintain the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation's form.</p>
 <p>This cultivation made Qing Shui very happy. It was because he could continue with his other cultivation while he kept up the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. For example, he could train his Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p>Time passed by very quickly and he would rest when he ran out of spirit energy. There were Spirit Gathering Formations in the area and he recovered very quickly. Moreover, he also had the Arhat Rosary Beads which brought him monstrous recovery rates.</p>
 <p>Time passed by just like that, one day in the real world was the equivalent of 100 days for Qing Shui. Although his Earth Diamond Bear was still in the adolescent phase, it had increased in size by about one foot. This was progress and it made Qing Shui extremely happy; it was good as long as there was progress. However, Qing Shui's Great Golden Buddha Palm had already reached the second wave.</p>
 <p>The cultivation of his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation only required him to keep it up. Therefore, Qing Shui spent most of his cultivating time on the Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui wanted was primarily to strengthen his foundations. Otherwise, he felt that he could reach the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or even 6th wave for the Great Golden Buddha Palm. After all, he was already at the Sword of Sixth Wave.</p>
 <p>This time around, he had plenty of time, and he understood many things. This was why he took it one step at a time. The prowess of this Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was definitely very strong and heaven-defying. He hoped that this could become a powerful trump card for him.</p>
 <p>Even with the second wave of the Great Golden Buddha Palm, Qing Shui already felt that it was very strong. He used his spiritual confinement, and especially with the effect of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, Qing Shui felt that its confinement strength or the prowess of its slap was strong enough to create a cavity even in the sky.</p>
