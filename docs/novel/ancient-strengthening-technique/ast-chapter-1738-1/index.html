 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mud Stone Flame Demon Beast slowly came to a stop and became a small mountain with piles of stones. At this moment, the group fixed their sight onto the golden barrier. If their assumption was correct, it should be the door leading to the treasure room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at the same time, everyone suddenly fixed their sight on Qing Shui. Without noticing, even Shui Yunfeng himself had started to rely more and more on Qing Shui. His heart was suddenly struck with this feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t really hate how that felt. The reason was that it was a blessing to meet someone whom he could rely on so much. Anyone would want to find someone whom they could believe in and be best friends with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at the same time, this kind of feeling also came to prove something. That was, Qing Shui was more outstanding than himself. At least, this was how Shui Yunfeng was feeling for now. In reality, not everyone would enjoy this. A lot of self-centered people wouldn’t allow anyone to be more outstanding than themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the majority of people would never want to come across someone who was more outstanding than themselves. However, everyone was bound to meet a lot of superior people in this world. They were the existences which one would look up to. Hence, it was a great thing to be friends with them, as it would only benefit oneself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, we will help you guard the entrance.” Shui Yunfeng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew what Shui Yunfeng was thinking. He was basically the only person who fought the battles against the Mud Stone Flame Demon Beast. Hence, he felt that Qing Shui deserved the treasures. After all, whether they could successfully make it out this time still remained a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he never really had much hope of getting the treasures. So long as he could make it out alive, it would have been the greatest treasure for him. Just as the saying ‘to stick together through thick and thin’. Initially, he thought that meeting Qing Shui was a blessing to him. But the way things were going right before his eyes now had made him realize that though his hidden illness had the hopes of being cured, he might not be fortunate enough to reap its reward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, Shui Yunfeng got a bit depressed. It took him so much effort to finally understand that he must live strong. And because of that, he never expected for something like this to happen to him all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was just how life was. The god played a huge joke on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Shui Yunfeng and said, “Brother, why don’t we go in together? For all you know, you might end up finding some unique elixirs and surpass the Ocean Demon Palace in an instant. That way, they will no longer be able to act so arrogantly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng brightened up and nodded. After that, he went into the bright gate together with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once again, Qing Shui felt a rhythmical move in his Spiritual Sense. Both Qing Shui and Shui Yunfeng had arrived in a place which resembled a shrine. As soon as they entered the room, they were struck by a chilly aura. It was a feeling which words couldn’t describe. Simultaneously, the room also contained a sacred aura within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked around the area, probing his surroundings. This entire place was very clean. There was nothing they could spot within their line of sights. The two girls and the others also followed after them and went in not long after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So this is the treasure room. Why does it seem like nothing is in here?” The Sunset Palace Lord said gently after looking around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is a sword there!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge pointed towards the other end of the room. It could already be considered as an inner room. However, the only thing which they could tell was that the inner room was a very small room. On top of the wall hung a sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go and take a look.” Qing Shui led the group and advanced his way toward the inner room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hold your steps! Look down!” Qing Shui suddenly warned everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without noticing, a square-patterned image suddenly appeared below their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, that’s the Nine Palace Image!” Muyun Qingge said in amazement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seemed like there could be treasures around here. What we are seeing is an illusion. It’s only when we walk past the Nine Palace Image below our feet that we would get to find the treasures.” Qing Shui said while looking down below his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, why don’t you follow me?” Qing Shui said to Shui Yunfeng. When Qing Shui saw Shui Yunfeng expression, he figured out that he might not know about the Nine Palace Image. The reason being that the Nine Palace Image here was a bit complex. If a person only knew a thing or two about it, it would be very difficult for them to make it through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this moment, the two girls displayed their knowledge of the Nine Palace Image. They were able to walk within the image with ease. Despite that, Qing Shui was still a bit worried. If anything unexpected were to happen, they might not be able to deal with it. Hence, he didn’t let them walk too far away. They were only allowed to travel within the area coverage of the Nine Palace Image. If anything unexpected occurred, they could at least make their way out on time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng nodded and began following Qing Shui. He wasn’t worried that Qing Shui would cause any harm to him. Though it might be a good opportunity now, Qing Shui had long lost his intention to kill people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Shui Yunfeng had already deeply trusted Qing Shui. He used to rarely trust others. It had been a long time since he put his faith in a person. For a person who lived in an aristocratic clan, even their father or brothers could never be trusted. The only thing that they could trust was their own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui led the group and after walking around in different directions, they arrived in a room that seemed to be cut out from others. This place looked just like a vacant house. However, there was a drawing hanging on the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a drawing of mountains and water!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a very huge drawing. On the drawing, numerous tall mountains could be seen. The water in the river was flowing rapidly. The sky was filled with blankets of clouds. Male eagles could be seen, opening their wings wide and flying in it. At the bottom of the drawing was a gloomy forest filled with ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly, Qing Shui felt as if he had entered the picture. The drawing itself already possessed dominant and abundant aura. As soon as Qing Shui entered the drawing, he was immediately struck by a sort of pressure. It felt as if the entire sky had fallen on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It caused his legs to feel numb. Qing Shui’s figure was upright but as for Shui Yunfeng and the others, they seemed to be unable to withstand the enormous pressure of Heavenly Dao and started to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right at this moment, Qing Shui’s pressure abruptly burst open. It felt as if he had managed to help understand quite a lot of the pressure, making the others to feel much better. Even the two girls found themselves suffering a little prior to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within this short period of time, Qing Shui seemed to have understood a lot. He initially possessed profound knowledge in the Force of Heavenly Dao. Back when he first saw the image, it might be because of his proficiency in Path of Drawing, the Yin-yang Image within his Sea of Consciousness suddenly started revolving like it was about to burst.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yin-yang Image broke through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what Qing Shui felt. The Yin-Yang Image hadn’t undergone any changes for many years. But at this moment, he felt that the Yin-Yang Image which had been constantly moving suddenly has gotten more and more abundant. Furthermore, his entire vision, Spirit Energy, as well as body’s recoveries and state, had also begun undergoing significant changes.</span></p>

This was a kind of formless treasure. It wasn’t an obvious increase but more like an invisible one. For example, it helped to increase actual damage dealt to the opponents, but it couldn’t be noticed from the surface. It was just the same when the damage dealt by a form of energy was greater than those at the same level as itself. This was the function of the Yin-Yang Image.</span></p>

It also helped in recovering his injuries, stamina, as well as endurance, turning him into an unstoppable force. But obviously, it was impossible for this kind of recovery to make up for the energy consumptions in actual battles.</span></p>

An absolute Divine Technique. Everyone should already know about how horrific it could be if there was a thin stream which flowed forever. Not to mention it also had a lot of functions.</span></p>
