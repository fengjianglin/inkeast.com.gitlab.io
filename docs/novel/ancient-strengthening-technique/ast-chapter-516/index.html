 <p><strong>Chapter 516 Condensing a Ball of Qi of Life, Recovering the Upper Dantian, Training Bitterly in the Water.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 516 - Condensing a Ball of Qi of Life, Recovering the Upper Dantian, Training Bitterly in the Water</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but be surprised, the Qi of Life in his Dantian had already condensed into a white ball the size of a grape.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui felt his body’s strength recover, only that the broken meridians and internal organs had had no changes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui was not worried, this was already a very good result, he had passed the stage of “Blades and Swords”.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui relaxed, his body suddenly emitted a golden radiance, causing Qing Shui to be stunned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Dan in the “Zhongfu” was restored in an instant, giving off a golden radiance, a strand of majestic strength followed the circulation path of the Heavenly Dan, spreading throughout his body and bones.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a complex emotion showing in his eyes, he had the urge to cry!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The second-grade Heavenly Dantian was restored back to its original state, recovering two million jin of strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Two million jin of strength was something that he once did not put in his eyes, but now, this gave Qing Shui to have hope, a big hope.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not imagine that after persisting for more than a month, he recovered his Upper Dantian when he was about to give up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a joyous surprise, a huge joyous surprise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, Qing Shui knew that it is impossible to recover everything immediately, furthermore, there was only a hope of recovery in the first place. &nbsp;After going through the stage of “Blades and Swords”, Qing Shui felt the later stages are not that easy to accomplish.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This surprise of the Upper Dantian recovering led Qing Shui to be more confident, but cultivating this Ancient Book of "Rebirth" didn’t have any relation to strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The purpose of the Ancient Book of "Rebirth" was to arouse the deepest potential of the body, that strong life force could heal all injuries in the body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was the principle of it, it was just hard to say if it would be successful…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a wave of a hand, he kept all the swords and blades, these items had already bathed in the fresh blood of Qing Shui, thus, Qing Shui kept them as a memorial.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only when you lose what you had, then you would realize the preciousness of it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under the effects of the Qi of Life, the injuries in on his legs recovered very fast, however, because they got injured every day, they were a tragic sight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He washed himself up below, changed his clothes and looked at the sky. In the last three months, he only rested for half a day, now he could rest for another half a day…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He saw a few people doing a sword dance in the distance, Di Chen was teaching Qing Qing some footwork. Qing Shui slowly walked towards the few girls. In all of these days, this was the first time Qing Shui was in such a good mood, although he did not complete recover and his internal organs were frequently on the verge of collapse.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li cried out happily when she Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hearing Huoyun Liu-Li, all the other girls turned to face Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, you’ve recovered?” Canghai Mingyue eyes were full of spirit as she asked Qing Shui excitedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen just looked weirdly at the Zhongfu area at Qing Shui’s chest, then looked at Qing Shui’s eyes, Qing Shui subtly shook his head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment, Qing Shui thought he saw a lonely look in Di Chen’s eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ve recovered a little!” Qing Shui nodded his head, facing Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, there were some things that Qing Qing did not know about his body’s situation, thus they could not say it in the open. However, they could tell what they wanted to say by exchanging glances or saying something vague.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It has been quite a while, let's all go back and celebrate, I have recovered some of my strength today, I am very happy.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui really was happy, do not look down on this two million jin of strength, with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and the Fire Bird, Qing Shui could still accomplish some unexpected things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Back at Qing Village, Lin Zhanhan’s eyes brightened after seeing Qing Shui. Qing Shui repeated once again that he had only recovered some strength, Lin Zhanhan laughed quietly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At night, in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui wore his battle armor, it was a pity that he only had so much defense, without the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, all his techniques are gone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Qing Shui’s abilities were limited to his body’s strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During this period of time, Qing Shui felt the Thousand Hammer Technique improve rapidly, even though he did not have his previous strength, or else Qing Shui felt that there would be a great change.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui woke up on the next day, He started to practice the Tai Chi Fist for the first time in a long time. In this period of time, Qing Shui had only practiced in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the other times, Qing Shui had other things to do.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was rare that he ate breakfast at home, after bidding everyone goodbye, Qing Shui went to the big waterfall again. From today onwards, Qing Shui started to practice the next stage of the Ancient Book of "Rebirth".</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, Qing Shui realized that there were only a few pages left, he had already practiced to the last stage. In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had used a whole day’s of time to carefully examined the remaining drawings.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In one of the drawings, there was a man in the sea, standing with the water up to the pit of his stomach.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The second drawing showed a person facing the sea throwing punches, the punches seemed very ordinary but the person in the drawing had achieved a terrifying vital energy, spirit, and proficiency.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The simple punch seemed to contain the laws of heaven and earth, At this moment, Qing Shui suddenly discovered a new realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With just a look, Qing Shui was sure that the realm of the person in the drawing was at Providence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Providence”, it was an indistinct realm, once, Qing Shui’s Basic Sword Techniques had reached the Heaven realm, his remaining techniques had good and bad intermingled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the third drawing, Qing Shui saw the sea being separated by the man in the drawing, turning it into a huge waterfall. Qing Shui felt that this required some kind of opportunity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the next drawing, he saw the sea being turned into dry ground by the man’s punches, that punch caused people to feel that it contained a terrifying strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui saw a drawing that had caused him to tremble, in that drawing, that man punched once, the seawater rose into the air, creating a huge water screen. What caused Qing Shui to feel shocked was that it was like a huge dragon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even to the point where Qing Shui could feel an indistinct pressure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui reached that drawing, he did not continue to look, but instead slowing closed the book!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui had arrived at the waterfall where he had spent half a year at. This mountain stream had a humongous waterfall, below the waterfall, there was a big pool.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s destination was that big pool!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He jumped in with his clothes on, walked to a level where the water reached his chest and slowly closed his eyes. The grace that Qing Shui had when he had broken through to the Heaven realm of his Tai Chi Fist was still present.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood in the water for a whole hour without moving, not even a single movement!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the time it takes for a joss stick to burn, Qing Shui suddenly punched out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s arm pierced through the water like an arrow, but it did not cause any water to splash up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Then, Qing Shui punched out again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The water splattered in every <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="583c312a3d3b2c31373618">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The degree of strength grasped was still too weak.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly. At this moment, he knew that his own realm was close to what was needed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, he realized the reason for why there were so many experts in the Central Continent. Cultivation may be difficult, but there were many paths to the same destination, all the roads lead to the same point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, but he had lost a lot of things. When there is gain, there is loss, Qing Shui understood this principle very well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui had calmed his heart down, he started on the most boring cultivation. The resistive force was targeted against him, the stronger the strength, the faster the speed, the stronger the resistive force.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many ripples spread around the surroundings!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wave Essence?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of his Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui no longer had the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he still had the technique and awareness. After thinking for awhile, he punched out again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time a small water screen rose!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So the splashed from between the waves creates a big water screen…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One punch, another punch…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued to punch out without resting!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang! Bang…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Dull sounds kept ringing out one after another, the now tired Qing Shui stopped, then he meditated. He thought of the feeling he had gotten from the man in the drawing and his grace. He then once again continued to punch out non-stop…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Spring ended and summer came!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Autumn went past in a flash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui woke up in the morning, the snow was falling like goose feathers. Qing Shui’s tent was pitched beside the pool. Eight months... Qing Shui had been punching in the pool for a full eight months, in addition to the time spent earlier , it was a total of a year and a half.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had already spent half of his three years of time!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui did not have any major feelings about it because the Qi of Life in his body was stronger than it was in the past by many times, Right now, the ball of Qi of Life in his Dantian was the size of a walnut.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under the effects of the Qi of Life, Qing Shui’s six hollow organs had recovered not long ago, his bones had healed as well. He was only left with the five viscera and meridians.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: Tai Chi Mastery concepts: Six hollow organs: gall bladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, triple heater, and bladder. Five Viscera: Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lungs, and Kidneys]</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Qi of Life in the body does not circulate via the meridian, it directly spread from the Dantian. Qing Shui knew he’d already taken a big step toward recovery, he even can see the end of it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For the past eight months, regardless of the weather, Qing Shui did not rest for even a day, today’s snow did not even affect Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although the weather was cold and the ground was freezing, the waterfall never stopped. The water was constantly moving, thus it saved Qing Shui the trouble of boring a hole in the ice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He jumped into the chilled water, took a deep breath and furiously punched out, both his fists had a faint glow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A huge water screen arose, in the water screen, appeared a big empty ground!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the result of Qing Shui’s unrelenting practice for the past eight months.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel that his body’s strength had increased by more than one factor, it was a pity that he did not have the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. When Qing Shui thought of this, he sighed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The things that were lost had been the best things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The snow got heavier and heavier, after a while, Qing Shui was covered in snow. His surroundings had transformed into a winter wonderland.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The snow that fell on the water around Qing Shui did not melt, this strange sight caused Qing Shui to sigh, the exquisite snowflakes just floated on the water.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A fist punched out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The snow scattered everywhere. The strong attack had scattered the snow into the air, but they were replaced by other snowflakes, as though they had never existed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui returned to the shore, he saw three girls, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li and Qing Qing. The three of them were wearing the fox fur coat Qing Shui had made for them. The three absolute beauties were standing on the snow-filled ground dressed in white fox fur coats, it was hard to tell who was the prettiest.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at the three girls, Qing Shui felt a sense of warmth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Auntie said that you should go back for the new year,” Canghai Mingyue said softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought for a while, it was almost the new year. He had not gone back for the new year last year, instead he had spent the whole month here.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just at this moment, Di Chen, who was dressed in white, came trampling through the snow, a veil covering her face. She was stunningly beautiful, in this winter wonderland, the fluttering snowflakes made her look like a goddess.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a complex emotion showing in his eyes, he had the urge to cry!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The second-grade Heavenly Dantian was restored back to its original state, recovering two million jin of strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Two million jin of strength was something that he once did not put in his eyes, but now, this gave Qing Shui to have hope, a big hope.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not imagine that after persisting for more than a month, he recovered his Upper Dantian when he was about to give up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a joyous surprise, a huge joyous surprise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, Qing Shui knew that it is impossible to recover everything immediately, furthermore, there was only a hope of recovery in the first place. &nbsp;After going through the stage of “Blades and Swords”, Qing Shui felt the later stages are not that easy to accomplish.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This surprise of the Upper Dantian recovering led Qing Shui to be more confident, but cultivating this Ancient Book of "Rebirth" didn’t have any relation to strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The purpose of the Ancient Book of "Rebirth" was to arouse the deepest potential of the body, that strong life force could heal all injuries in the body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was the principle of it, it was just hard to say if it would be successful…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a wave of a hand, he kept all the swords and blades, these items had already bathed in the fresh blood of Qing Shui, thus, Qing Shui kept them as a memorial.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only when you lose what you had, then you would realize the preciousness of it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under the effects of the Qi of Life, the injuries in on his legs recovered very fast, however, because they got injured every day, they were a tragic sight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He washed himself up below, changed his clothes and looked at the sky. In the last three months, he only rested for half a day, now he could rest for another half a day…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He saw a few people doing a sword dance in the distance, Di Chen was teaching Qing Qing some footwork. Qing Shui slowly walked towards the few girls. In all of these days, this was the first time Qing Shui was in such a good mood, although he did not complete recover and his internal organs were frequently on the verge of collapse.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li cried out happily when she Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hearing Huoyun Liu-Li, all the other girls turned to face Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, you’ve recovered?” Canghai Mingyue eyes were full of spirit as she asked Qing Shui excitedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Chen just looked weirdly at the Zhongfu area at Qing Shui’s chest, then looked at Qing Shui’s eyes, Qing Shui subtly shook his head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment, Qing Shui thought he saw a lonely look in Di Chen’s eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ve recovered a little!” Qing Shui nodded his head, facing Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, there were some things that Qing Qing did not know about his body’s situation, thus they could not say it in the open. However, they could tell what they wanted to say by exchanging glances or saying something vague.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It has been quite a while, let's all go back and celebrate, I have recovered some of my strength today, I am very happy.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui really was happy, do not look down on this two million jin of strength, with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and the Fire Bird, Qing Shui could still accomplish some unexpected things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Back at Qing Village, Lin Zhanhan’s eyes brightened after seeing Qing Shui. Qing Shui repeated once again that he had only recovered some strength, Lin Zhanhan laughed quietly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At night, in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui wore his battle armor, it was a pity that he only had so much defense, without the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, all his techniques are gone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Qing Shui’s abilities were limited to his body’s strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During this period of time, Qing Shui felt the Thousand Hammer Technique improve rapidly, even though he did not have his previous strength, or else Qing Shui felt that there would be a great change.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui woke up on the next day, He started to practice the Tai Chi Fist for the first time in a long time. In this period of time, Qing Shui had only practiced in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the other times, Qing Shui had other things to do.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was rare that he ate breakfast at home, after bidding everyone goodbye, Qing Shui went to the big waterfall again. From today onwards, Qing Shui started to practice the next stage of the Ancient Book of "Rebirth".</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon, Qing Shui realized that there were only a few pages left, he had already practiced to the last stage. In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had used a whole day’s of time to carefully examined the remaining drawings.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In one of the drawings, there was a man in the sea, standing with the water up to the pit of his stomach.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The second drawing showed a person facing the sea throwing punches, the punches seemed very ordinary but the person in the drawing had achieved a terrifying vital energy, spirit, and proficiency.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The simple punch seemed to contain the laws of heaven and earth, At this moment, Qing Shui suddenly discovered a new realm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With just a look, Qing Shui was sure that the realm of the person in the drawing was at Providence.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Providence”, it was an indistinct realm, once, Qing Shui’s Basic Sword Techniques had reached the Heaven realm, his remaining techniques had good and bad intermingled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the third drawing, Qing Shui saw the sea being separated by the man in the drawing, turning it into a huge waterfall. Qing Shui felt that this required some kind of opportunity.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the next drawing, he saw the sea being turned into dry ground by the man’s punches, that punch caused people to feel that it contained a terrifying strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui saw a drawing that had caused him to tremble, in that drawing, that man punched once, the seawater rose into the air, creating a huge water screen. What caused Qing Shui to feel shocked was that it was like a huge dragon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even to the point where Qing Shui could feel an indistinct pressure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui reached that drawing, he did not continue to look, but instead slowing closed the book!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui had arrived at the waterfall where he had spent half a year at. This mountain stream had a humongous waterfall, below the waterfall, there was a big pool.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s destination was that big pool!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He jumped in with his clothes on, walked to a level where the water reached his chest and slowly closed his eyes. The grace that Qing Shui had when he had broken through to the Heaven realm of his Tai Chi Fist was still present.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood in the water for a whole hour without moving, not even a single movement!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the time it takes for a joss stick to burn, Qing Shui suddenly punched out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s arm pierced through the water like an arrow, but it did not cause any water to splash up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Then, Qing Shui punched out again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The water splattered in every <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="583c312a3d3b2c31373618">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The degree of strength grasped was still too weak.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly. At this moment, he knew that his own realm was close to what was needed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, he realized the reason for why there were so many experts in the Central Continent. Cultivation may be difficult, but there were many paths to the same destination, all the roads lead to the same point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, but he had lost a lot of things. When there is gain, there is loss, Qing Shui understood this principle very well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui had calmed his heart down, he started on the most boring cultivation. The resistive force was targeted against him, the stronger the strength, the faster the speed, the stronger the resistive force.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Many ripples spread around the surroundings!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wave Essence?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of his Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui no longer had the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he still had the technique and awareness. After thinking for awhile, he punched out again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time a small water screen rose!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So the splashed from between the waves creates a big water screen…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One punch, another punch…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued to punch out without resting!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang! Bang…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dull sounds kept ringing out one after another, the now tired Qing Shui stopped, then he meditated. He thought of the feeling he had gotten from the man in the drawing and his grace. He then once again continued to punch out non-stop…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Spring ended and summer came!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Autumn went past in a flash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui woke up in the morning, the snow was falling like goose feathers. Qing Shui’s tent was pitched beside the pool. Eight months... Qing Shui had been punching in the pool for a full eight months, in addition to the time spent earlier , it was a total of a year and a half.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had already spent half of his three years of time!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui did not have any major feelings about it because the Qi of Life in his body was stronger than it was in the past by many times, Right now, the ball of Qi of Life in his Dantian was the size of a walnut.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under the effects of the Qi of Life, Qing Shui’s six hollow organs had recovered not long ago, his bones had healed as well. He was only left with the five viscera and meridians.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: Tai Chi Mastery concepts: Six hollow organs: gall bladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, triple heater, and bladder. Five Viscera: Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lungs, and Kidneys]</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Qi of Life in the body does not circulate via the meridian, it directly spread from the Dantian. Qing Shui knew he’d already taken a big step toward recovery, he even can see the end of it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For the past eight months, regardless of the weather, Qing Shui did not rest for even a day, today’s snow did not even affect Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although the weather was cold and the ground was freezing, the waterfall never stopped. The water was constantly moving, thus it saved Qing Shui the trouble of boring a hole in the ice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He jumped into the chilled water, took a deep breath and furiously punched out, both his fists had a faint glow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A huge water screen arose, in the water screen, appeared a big empty ground!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the result of Qing Shui’s unrelenting practice for the past eight months.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel that his body’s strength had increased by more than one factor, it was a pity that he did not have the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. When Qing Shui thought of this, he sighed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The things that were lost had been the best things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The snow got heavier and heavier, after a while, Qing Shui was covered in snow. His surroundings had transformed into a winter wonderland.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The snow that fell on the water around Qing Shui did not melt, this strange sight caused Qing Shui to sigh, the exquisite snowflakes just floated on the water.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A fist punched out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The snow scattered everywhere. The strong attack had scattered the snow into the air, but they were replaced by other snowflakes, as though they had never existed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui returned to the shore, he saw three girls, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li and Qing Qing. The three of them were wearing the fox fur coat Qing Shui had made for them. The three absolute beauties were standing on the snow-filled ground dressed in white fox fur coats, it was hard to tell who was the prettiest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at the three girls, Qing Shui felt a sense of warmth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Auntie said that you should go back for the new year,” Canghai Mingyue said softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought for a while, it was almost the new year. He had not gone back for the new year last year, instead he had spent the whole month here.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just at this moment, Di Chen, who was dressed in white, came trampling through the snow, a veil covering her face. She was stunningly beautiful, in this winter wonderland, the fluttering snowflakes made her look like a goddess.</p>
