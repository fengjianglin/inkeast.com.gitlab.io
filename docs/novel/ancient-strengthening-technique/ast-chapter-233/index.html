 <p><strong>Chapter 233 Yueyue, what are you doing at Peony Court?.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p>AST 233 – Yueyue, what are you doing at Peony Court?</p>
  <p>“Lass, where did you hear those experiences from?” Qing Shui chuckled, staring straight at the pretty face turning crimson. </p>
  <p>“Sister Mingyue said it!” Huoyun Liuli looked down and replied softly. </p>
  <p>“Her? She is a little fool like you!” QIng Shui wanted to laugh just thinking about Canghai Minyue. If not for the interactions during this period, one would have thought that the magnificent woman who could wreck a country would have tons of experience. Moreover, such a goddess like herself would be able to have any man she wanted. It was a pity the lady with sky-high standards was still unbetrothed, and that such a good resource was not put to good use. </p>
  <p>He had even been jealous of the man who could heave and toss about with her every night. A romantic affair would definitely ignite the jealousy of anyone. Little did he expect her to have various reasons for not appreciating men. This made Qing Shui comfortable and proud, even using words to tease her to the extremes a few times. </p>
  <p>Even though he had never been in state of ecstasy with her before, he had some sort of emotional clash with her. There was a strange feeling that made his heart beat, especially when he held her fair hands while flirting with her, and that time when the tip of his nose touched hers. It was unforgettable for Qing Shui. </p>
  <p>“You’re the fool,” Huoyun Liuli whined coquettishly, glanced a little grudgingly, and made Qing Shui break out in a sweat. She was like a grudging wife, but more like a dissatisfied wife. </p>
  <p>“We’re at the house entrance, let go of me!” Huoyun Liuli lightly pulled away her hand from Qing Shui. </p>
  <p>“You’re making it seem as if we’re having a secret affair, are you afraid of being seen?” Qing Shui jokingly watched Huoyun Liuli act unnaturally. Her beauty that was within reach was delectable.</p>
  <p>Even though he said that, he reluctantly let go of the soft, small hand. </p>
  <p>Back at the Cang Hai House, Canghai Mingyue was already there watching as they came back, albeit a little awkwardly. </p>
  <p>“Yueyue, what is the Peony Court?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui overheard the fatso saying he would bring that group of young chaps to Peony Court for some fun after finishing up him. Even without thinking, it must be a place of romance like Night Fragrance Court, but Qing Shui wanted to tease this goddess who got cold feet, and who was frightened away by the big fatso’s nudity. What would she do if he accidentally tore apart her clothes while dueling? </p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that this idea of his was definitely plausible… </p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue looked strangely at Qing Shui, who was asking herself seriously. She had the feeling Qing Shui was teasing herself, but that sincere expression was filled with the desire to know. Nevertheless, she thought he must be asking it on purpose. </p>
  <p>“Place of romance, why does the great craftsman Qing Shui want to visit there?” Canghai Mingyue replied, embarrassed. That slight arch of those mountain-like eyebrows was persistent in maintaining eye contact with the clear eyes of Qing Shui. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui blinked his eyes, and used the same tactics to stick out his tongue. Before the lewd action was completed, Canghai Mingyue spat and looked away. Goodness knows if the blooming beauty that could wreck a country was angry or embarrassed; the charm of the crimson face was unrivalled. </p>
  <p>“A brothel? What does it sell?” Qing Shui retracted the tongue that did not complete its mission, and continued to exclaim his desire for knowledge.</p>
  <p>“Pu-he!” Huoyun Liuli burst out laughing, walked to Canghai Mingyue, and casted a sidelong glance at Qing Shui. She then went towards the living hall with Canghai Mingyue as it was lunchtime. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked as Cang Hai’s wife brought out the dishes. She laid them out for everyone, while Cang Hai was motionless. He was her man, Canghai Mingyue was her daughter who was doted on, and Huoyun Liuli was practically their half-daughter. He was in a rather awkward position. </p>
  <p>Actually, Qing Shui had wanted to leave the Cang Hai Family; he was unfamiliar with the present. For instance, the unrelated lady he was staring at now was taking care of their meals everyday. Qing Shui saw a motherly figure in her, which was also the reason for him staying at the Cang Hai Family. </p>
  <p>However, Qing Shui knew he should be leaving. Even if he would be remaining here for a long time, he had decided to leave the Cang Hai Family. As for Huoyun Liuli, it would be better for her to stay on. </p>
  <p>After a good meal and some random conversations, Cang Hai looked at Qing Shui with interest. “Do you have something to say? If there is, please speak your mind, and I will resolve it for you.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had the impulse to let Cang Hai deal with the Yan Family, but quickly dismissed that thought. The issue in Yan City must be dealt with using his own hands. </p>
  <p>“Senior, I have been disturbing you for such a long time, and brought you lots of trouble. I will leave today.” Qing Shui replied to the Cang Hai couple sincerely. </p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you’re leaving?” Huoyun Liuli, shocked, and barely managed a wispy remark. That voice was panicky, entering Qing Shui’s ear with a tremble.</p>
  <p>“I will move out temporarily. I will still be in the Southern City for a long time, though I probably have to roam about.” Qing Shui smiled and spoke gently to the pale face. </p>
  <p>Seeing such a small change in Huoyun Liuli with just one sentence, the sight was engraved in Qing Shui’s heart. It seemed that the pale, perfect, and beautiful face would forever remain in Qing Shui’s heart, never forgotten. </p>
  <p>“You’re living well here, why do you have the need to move out? Do you not like your room, or is the food not to your liking? Treat this place as your own. Cang Hai and I have only one daughter. Although you haven’t been here long, Cang Hai and I have been treating you as our nephew!” Ruotong said seriously, her pretty, thin eyebrows slightly frowning. </p>
  <p>He must admit that he was swayed by the words of this beautiful, gentle lady. That “soft knife” would definitely be the most powerful in injuring or comforting people. </p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was merely shocked from the moment Qing Shui confessed that he was leaving, but kept silent. She started at him with that pair of deep, bright, beautiful eyes. </p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, treat this as your own home. Ruotong and I hope that you can stay. Moreover, there’s Yueyue and Liuli. There are young people that can interact.” Cang Hai smiled at Qing Shui but remarked seriously. </p>
  <p>“I am very happy here, but I will be out for some time. I will come back anytime!” Qing Shui acted casually and replied. </p>
  <p>Ruotong was evidently disappointed. She looked at Qing Shui, back at Cang Hai, and finally at her daughter silently. She saw that Canghai Mingyue’s initially unnatural face had recovered, and sighed. </p>
  <p>“Let Yueyue accompany you while you look for lodging in the afternoon. She should be more familiar with this place.” Ruotong smiled at Qing Shui. </p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was startled, then smiled unnaturally!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui flinched, rubbed his nose, and grinned. He felt that she was “promoting” her daughter to him. Qing Shui could not understand that such a goddess lady like Canghai Mingyue still needed their concern. </p>
