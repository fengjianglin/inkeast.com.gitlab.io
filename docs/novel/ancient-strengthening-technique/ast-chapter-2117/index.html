 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Dali heard that it was possible with some pain and said excitedly, “I’m not afraid of any pain. No one in my family has ever achieved a breakthrough to Martial Saint. Mr. Qing, I know I can’t help you much, but as long as I’m alive, if you need this Martial King Origin Essence Pill, I will collect it for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Dali was extremely excited, the difference between a Martial King and Martial Saint was similar to the gap between an ordinary person and Xiantian level. A Martial Saint was considered a skilled warrior everywhere as the normal people would not meet a warrior as capable as Qing Shui anyway. Even if they meet one, they would not realize it. Zhang Dali would never know that Qing Shui was a Divine warrior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used the power of Shield Attack to forcefully open Zhang Dali’s Yangguan Acupoint. He even helped Zhang Dali to stabilize his constitution. Then, using the Origin Qi, he led Zhang Dali. With the Strength Infusion, Zhang Dali achieved the breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It did not take a long time or cause a chaos. Zhang Dali felt his body improved several times stronger. He knelt before Qing Shui and bowed instantly, “Thanks for fulfilling my wish, Mr. Qing”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned, this guy was really honest to treat him as a Master. Qing Shui led him into the Martial Saint realm. Hence, he did not stop Zhang Dali. After a few kowtows, Qing Shui dragged him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not say much. He surely would not allow this honest guy to bow for nothing. Moreover, Qing Shui liked his honesty and taught him the Tiger Form. He even explained it meticulously to Zhang Dali.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Dali was overwhelmed with joy but he was out of words. A person like him would usually keep the favors in his heart. He would show his appreciation through actions instead of sweet words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, when I’m here, you can find me if there is anything you don’t know, go!” Qing Shui smiled and said to Zhang Dali. Then, he waved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Dali nodded and bowed deeply before he said his farewell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui always wanted to open his Imperial Cuisine Hall to all corners of Nine Continents and spread his Tiger Form together with other techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that was quite impractical. People usually valued their own techniques and inheritances very much, but Qing Shui did not. He believed that a different man could practice the same technique in different realms. Thus, it depended on the person instead of techniques. Yehuang Guwu practiced Qing Shui’s Tiger Form to the Divine grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mingyue Gelou also practiced Tiger Form and it became her strongest and main technique now. Unlike Yehuang Guwu, Mingyue Gelou practiced the actual Tiger Form, but her realm was almost comparable to Qing Shui’s. She spent all these years practicing Tiger Form and it paid off. Now, she mastered the moves of Tiger Form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tiger Form was an easier technique to master but it was very powerful among the other skills of Qing Shui. Most importantly, it was a technique of undefined grade. Since Yehuang Guwu could train until the Divine grade, the Tiger Form should be at least a Legendary or Divine grade technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subconsciously, he thought of the Zhen Clan. Though the Zhen Clan was a big Clan, it was far behind the Divine Palace in terms of class. Hence, he was not worried about being threatened by the Zhen Clan. Besides, a simple man could not easily threaten him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was unsure if he had mercy on the Zhen Clan. He punished Zhen Song in that incident and if he requested the Zhen Clan to be responsible, they could only be called unfortunate. However, Qing Shui did not do that. He did not actually take the Zhen Clan seriously. Apart from that, Qing Shui did not blame on the family in every case unless the Zhen Clan wanted to seek justice for Zhen Song.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhang Dali left, Qing Shui started to refine the Golden Martial King Pill. However, he had yet to refine it when this man came. Qing Shui looked at this man in surprise, it was a man with a handsome and scholar-like appearance. He did not seem like a son of the riches; contrarily, he seemed to be casual and approachable. His eyes were sincere and bright. He wore a clean and plain attire which looked extremely ordinary. Yet, he had an indistinct aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not surprised by the good appearance of the young man, he was not homosexual. He was surprised by the young man’s strength which was definitely stronger than him. It was Qing Shui’s first time seeing a young man who was steadily stronger than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a vague feeling. All these while, Qing Shui had the Ancient Strengthening Technique, the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and some treasures. He was definitely ahead of others at the same age. Now, he met a powerful rival. This man appeared as young as he was. They had similar ages if the age gap was within a hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man was surprised to see Qing Shui too. They stared at each other and the young man walked forward, “Hello, I’m looking for Nuolan. Is she around?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a little strange, but he nodded, “Yes, who are you. Is there anything you need from her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m Beihuang Yu. I have something to tell Nuolan,” The young man smiled to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu, Qing Shui knew that the Taiyi Immortal Palace was ruled by the Northern Emperor Clan and heard of this man before. He was so well-known, no wonder he was so powerful. The rumors seemed to be real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu was the young master of the Taiyi Immortal Palace without a doubt and had an irreplaceable position in the Taiyi Immortal Palace. He was the one in a million genius which was rarely found in the Taiyi Immortal Palace. His Taiyi Divine Sword was at a miraculous level. His sword was the sharpest and he almost attained the state of ‘one with the sword’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, this is the young master of the Taiyi Immortal Palace,” At that time, Nuolan stepped out and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nuolan!” The young man looked at Nuolan with fiery eyes. Yet, that was not a lusting look but pure admiration, it was sincere and frank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I said it. I don’t like you like that,” &nbsp;replied Nuolan gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I said I will wait for you. As long as you’re unmarried, I will be waiting for you. I will marry after you get married. I have my rights to like you and so do you have the rights to dislike me. However, you can’t stop my passion,” said Beihuang Yu to Nuolan seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not expect a man like this to exist. He was uncertain of Beihuang Yu’s temperament, but it seemed like this Beihuang Yu was a good match for Nuolan now. He reckoned that Beihuang Yu was a far better man than he was. After all, Beihuang Yu stayed single for this woman, regardless of his status with other women. Surely, he would have touched many other women with his trait of royalty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt he was unrivaled previously in terms of strength and love, as he had yet to meet someone who was threatening enough. Yet, he met one rival now in both aspects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, if Qing Shui wanted to make Nuolan his woman, he met a true rival now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuolan sighed, “I admit that you’re excellent, at least half of the women in the Northern Emperor City would think you’re the best man, but I don’t know why I have no feelings for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know I’m a little bit stubborn and uninteresting. I don’t know how to please you. Perhaps, in your mind, I’m just a training fanatic. But, I really like you and want to protect you,” Beihuang Yu was slightly upset, but he continued sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his strength, it was no surprise that he was a training fanatic. He must have extraordinary treasures too; otherwise, he would never attain his current level. Qing Shui was certain about this.</span></p>
