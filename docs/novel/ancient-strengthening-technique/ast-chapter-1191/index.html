 <p><strong>AST 1191 - The palm strike’s bearing and style</strong></p>
 <p>“Just one of us will be enough to you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head when he heard the old man’s words. However, he was also able to feel the old man’s tyrannical strength. They were unexpectedly all stronger than Tian Jiange and also stronger than himself.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui had ruined the plans of the Yu Clan and Third Prince. They naturally wouldn’t let him go unscathed. With their capabilities, they were naturally able to muster such a force.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know who incited you to come, but I simply want to tell you guys that there’s still time for you to leave. Otherwise, this will be your final resting place.” Qing Shui didn’t want to waste time on useless banter. The same also applied to his opponents.</p>
 <p>“Arrogant! Young man, don’t think that just because you have some strength, you are already at the top of the world. Today, I’m going to teach you that there’s is always someone out there who is stronger than you.”</p>
 <p>The old man extended his hand the moment he finished speaking. An enormous palm pierced through the sky and made its way towards Qing Shui. It emitted a powerful confinement strength on it, it was making terrifying hissing noises.</p>
 <p>Golden Thread Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was basically capable of ignoring such spirit energy attacks. He lifted his hand and immediately threw out his attack. Although he merely destroyed the old man’s enormous palm, he then suddenly charged toward the old man.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Since conciliation was not an option, Qing Shui decided to make them leave permanently. He used the Roaming Dragon Steps, his current speed within the Nine Palace positionings could be described as appearing and disappearing unpredictably.</p>
 <p>Close-combat was Qing Shui’s specialty, so much so that it could even be called one of Qing Shui’s terrifying killer moves. The old man would not be as lucky as Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui was attacking with the intention to kill. Hence, he didn’t hold back with his attacks. He utilized his footwork to its peak and focused on attacking the opponents acupoints. His state of Taichi had also reached a terrifying height.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Pa...</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and the old man were really fast. As palm imprints flew everywhere, the old man would be struck once in every ten palm strikes. As time passed, the old man began to gradually get struck even more. It had actually only been within the span of a few breaths since the fight started, their speed was simply too fast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was exerting his maximum strength in the attacks he threw out with his palms, fists and even fingers. The tyrannical strength of the seven-colored pellet was also slowly corroding the old man’s body, accumulating within him bit by bit.</p>
 <p>Striking acupoints to cause the old man’s body to become numb!</p>
 <p>When the rest of the old men realized what was happening, they all simultaneously unleashed their demonic beast armor manifestations and charged towards Qing Shui with their weapons.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qing Shui clenched both of his fists, unleashing ‘Twin Peaks Piercing The Ears’. Both of his fists struck the old man’s ears and temples while he was paralyzed.</p>
 <p>The place became silent.</p>
 <p>The other old men were stunned. This was the first time they have seen people of their strength getting pressured to such an extent by someone else. He was actually killed by a bare-handed strike to the head. The impact from the combination of the speed and mysteries of the fist technique was tremendous. It was so tremendous that they found it hard to accept.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also didn’t think that unleashing his footwork and speed to the utmost would be able to pressure someone to the extent that he couldn’t even use his demonic beast armor manifestation. This was because his acupoint strikes was no ordinary strikes. They could also temporarily cut the opponent’s meridian channels.</p>
 <p>This rendered the opponent unable to use his demonic beast armor manifestation, leading to a huge reduction in his strength. This was the terrifying part about a bare-handed fighter. Blocking the meridians by striking the acupoints!</p>
 <p>“Join hands to kill him!” an old man screamed in rage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out his Big Dipper Sword and with just a thought, the Nine Continents Mountain appeared. He swung his left hand and along with his intention, the Nine Continents Mountain rushed towards one of the remaining old men with terrifying strength.</p>
 <p>Actual battles were the fastest shortcut in increasing one’s strength and experience. It was also the best way to consolidate their power and stabilize their strength. It was precisely the most effective way in assisting breakthroughs.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui didn’t use Emperor’s Qi. He wanted to stabilize his own strength grasp every detail intimately through actual combat.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Dragon Whip!</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui shook his hand, the tip of the sword shot out a thick Primordial Flame Whip and immediately separated two of the old men that were charging towards him. The Primordial Flame Dragon Whip was like an intelligent grey dragon, deftly attacking the two old men.</p>
 <p>However, the two old men were still getting closer and closer. One of the old men tangled up Qing Shui’s Primordial Flame Dragon Whip whereas the other one aimed a pike at Qing Shui, sending a black eagle shaped gigantic energy diagram pouncing towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The black eagle was a crystallization of energy. It was about ten meters in size and the formidable power it gave off even shocked Qing Shui. Qing Shui swung his left hand.</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>A Seal of Xuantian immediately smashed towards the black eagle. Qing Shui was also anxious, immediately following up with another attack.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Seal of Xuantian dissipated, but what surprised Qing Shui was that the energy within the Seal of Xuantian seemed to have smashed its way into the black eagle’s body, immediately causing the black eagle to slow down.</p>
 <p>So the Seal of Xuantian could also be used this way!</p>
 <p>One Hand Cover Sky!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again swung his hand. A long golden colored palm imprint formed and directly striked the black eagle’s body.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>It was a heaven shaking noise. Unfortunately, it only managed to cause the black eagle to fall a little. It was still charging towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Currently, Qing Shui wasn’t using the Buddha Form Reveal nor was he using Buddha’s True Eyes. As he saw what happened, he knew that it was something that couldn’t be taken lightly. He quickly used both skills.</p>
 <p>One Hand Cover Sky!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again used the One Hand Cover Sky. This time, he combined it with the Big Dipper Sword. This was because the black eagle was already near him. The enormous golden palm imprint carried a dazzling golden light as it smashed the eagle loudly. Right at this moment, the old man with the pike had also made his way to the back of the black eagle, basically following right behind it.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The surroundings were in a burst of incitement. The loud explosions sounded as if the world was ending. At this moment, Qing Shui was dazed. The 20% chance of doubling his offensive strength actually activated.</p>
 <p>This was truly a tragedy for the old man. He was really confident with his battle strategy and was also really confident in the black shadow which he formed. However, he never imagined that the strength of that palm strike was so destructive that its strength actually didn’t decrease even after penetrating through the black shadow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked on as the black shadow dissipated and the old man momentarily exploding. The attack that was close to thirty five thousand nimbus wasn’t something the old man could take.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a little stunned. A quote appeared in his mind. It was a quote which he often used to come across in the past. Was it the force of the sword or the excellence in the sword. Did his fist demonstrate its overbearing force or was it its profound style...</p>
 <p>The old man’s death caused the other old man who were charging over to immediately halt in their steps. Another old man was being suppressed by the Nine Continents Mountain. Originally, the Nine Continents Mountain was unable to suppress him but Qing Shui had summoned the Thunderous Beast in the middle of the battle.</p>
 <p>The strength of the Thunderous Beast was currently also increasing rapidly. It constantly sent Thunderbolts and Violet Lightning Strikes at the old men. Because of the old man’s speed, he was actually suppressed just like that by the Thunderous Beast and Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>The more time passed, the more disadvantageous it was for him. Hence, he was waiting for someone else to kill Qing Shui before dealing with that hateful demonic beast. It was precisely this thought that caused him to fall into a defenseless state. Currently he could only wearily cope with the numbness of his limbs and the injuries from the Violet Lightning Strikes.</p>
 <p>The old man was still rather valiant. Otherwise, he would have been crushed to death by the Nine Continents Mountain when he was struck by the Violet Lightning Strike.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Qing Shui had experienced the strength doubling effect after his strength had increased tremendously. He felt that the 20% probability wasn’t very accurate and didn’t seem to be that high. Not only was his not that high, the probability on the weapons of Yan Yangchen and the others also seemed to be quite low. He only thought about it for a brief moment. In any case, having it would still be more powerful than not having it. As for whether the probability of the increase in strength, it was a matter of luck. If he was unlucky, he might not activate it even once in a hundred attempts.</p>
 <p>The other remaining old man was no longer able to maintain his calm expression from before and even started to have a little fear. Being able to kill someone with the Demonic Beast Manifestation Seal with just one strike… How strong was this man?</p>
 <p>The four old men had the strength of Grade Three State Masters. The first to be killed by Qing Shui has already reached twenty five thousand nimbus in strength. However, he was still swatted to death by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The two remaining two old men were slightly weaker than the first old man. Currently, he was timid. The fact that he was already scared before they even started fighting basically meant that he already had lost.</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Seventh Wave of the Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Confinement!</p>
 <p>Just as the old man came back to his senses, Qing Shui acted. Since he had already killed two of the old men, he would have to kill all of them. Furthermore, he had to do it quickly. Hence, he immediately used a formidable killing moves.</p>
 <p>Lion King’s Imprint!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted his hand, causing a huge rock immediately surround the old man.</p>
 <p>Explode!</p>
 <p>The Lion King’s Imprint’s most formidable power was its explosion, just that it was easy for the target to dodge before it exploded. However, the old man was currently being confined. Hence, the strength of the Lion King’s Imprint Qing Shui unleashed was extremely terrifying.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gathered their Interspatial Silk Sachets, cleaning up the area until no traces were left before he left. This battle helped him realize the strength of his battle techniques. For people with equal strength, advanced battle techniques, peak battle techniques, legendary or even paragon battle techniques were much more powerful than normal battle techniques.</p>
 <p>The combination of Lion King’s Imprint, Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines and the Seventh Wave of the Golden Buddha Palm’s confinement was perfect. In addition, the Seal of Xuantian was also quite decent. The Tidal Cloud Waves Seal, Diamond Buddha Devil Staff, the Nine Continents Mountain and of course, the Nine Palace Steps, were all extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>Tachi had always been Qing Shui’s foundation for all his techniques. It was used to strengthen the Ancient Strengthening Technique and also to consolidate and harmonise the different kinds of energy within his body with great effect.</p>
 <p>Seventh Heavenly Layer, Nine Yang Golden Body at Small Success Stage, Violet Gold Bloodline… All of these seemed to have stopped progressing. Qing Shui knew that they had reached their bottlenecks and was the greatest obstacles he had faced in his whoe life.</p>
 <p>There was no longer any activity within the seventh grade Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He had already plucked many Peaches of Immortality. Every peach could increase a person’s lifespan by fifty years. Even though he was satisfied with the current state of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui always had the feeling that the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and the Nine Heavenly Layers of the Ancient Strengthening Technique were connected.</p>
 <p>Seventh grade Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Seventh Heavenly Layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique. Both sides had basically progressed in tandem. Even if they were on different levels, it would at most be a difference of one grade and the slower would catch up very quickly.</p>
 <p>Many times it had been the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal that upgraded first andthe Ancient Strengthening Technique would subsequently break through. If the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal stopped progressing, so would the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Hence, Qing Shui felt that it would be hard for him to break through in the near future and his strength still needed to be consolidated and upgraded.</p>
 <p>It was still quite early when he returned to the Firecloud Blacksmith Store. Qing Shui went out after he cleaned up. The streets were brightly lit. There was almost no difference between day and night within Yan City.</p>
 <p>As he followed the crowd down the street, his heart was calm, especially calm. He missed Yu Ruyan and also missed his family. However, what he wanted more was to quickly increase his strength and locate Di Chen. It would be best if he could reunite his family. As long as that happened, it wasn’t important where they lived.</p>
 <p>There was still the matter he promised his mom, to look for Yan Zhongyue. Qing Shui rubbed his head. The continent was too big, looking for a specific person was harder than looking for a needle in the haystack.</p>
