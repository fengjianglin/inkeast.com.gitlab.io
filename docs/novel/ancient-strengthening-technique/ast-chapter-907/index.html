 <p><strong>AST 907 - Yet another twenty stars Increase, Dragon Elephant Force, Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens</strong></p>
 <p>At the moment, Qing Shui was at a loss. Forget about the other demonic beasts that didn’t undergo any changes, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was a very formidable beast, even though its increase in strength was quite significant, it still felt like it had barely achieved that.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui remembered the Snow Lion King, a demonic beast which already had the strength of a Peak Martial Saint. Could it be that it wanted to break through to Martial Emperor using the Jade Spirit Fruit?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was puzzled. He himself has already eaten a few of them. He felt that even though it was quite decent in terms of boosting strength, its effect would gradually fall dependant on the amount that he consumed. He estimated it would lose effect once he ate ten of them. However, it could help change body physique and bones, it was just that its effect would also decrease progressively. A 10% increase in strength was already quite decent. The strength stated here was talking about the strength which didn’t rely on any external factors. It included the raw strength and techniques. In one go, Qing Shui’s raw strength actually increased by twenty stars and achieved a total of sixty stars.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, twenty stars was still really heaven-defying, it was already worth it!</p>
 <p>Could it be that this was a Spirit Fruit for awakening innate skills and blood vessels? To think that such good stuff would be seized by a Peak Martial Saint Demonic Beast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered his Beast Pill. Could the effect of Jade Spirit Fruit be similar to that of a Beast Pill? Just that it’s more suitable for powerful demonic beasts and warriors but then, why would it not have any effect on the Five-Headed Demonic Spider? And it seemed to be useless with the other demonic beasts as well.</p>
 <p>Did it have to do with their species?</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant was evolved from the Diamond Demonic Boar. It had already awakened its innate skills and blood veins. Could it be that it could still awaken it for a second and third time?</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Fire Bird let out an ear-splitting chirp.</p>
 <p>Jet-black flame flourished all over its body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared at the Fire Bird that was growing more mighty in the air. He felt excited in his heart, it seemed that its bloodline had been awakened by a significant amount. Even if the Fire Bird had the bloodline of the legendary phoenix, there was still a long way to go before completely awakening it.</p>
 <p>He remembered the Roc Form. The ability of the Golden Winged Roc was really powerful. Merely from the earliest “Heart of Roc” and “Roc Spreading Wings”, he could already tell that it was more powerful than the Five-Headed Demonic Spider while the Dragon and Phoenix Forms were above that of the Roc Form.</p>
 <p>Since ancient times, both the phoenix and dragons represented peace. Dragons were the king of all beasts whereas the phoenix was the king of flying beasts. The legendary roc was actually also the descendant of the phoenix. Their bodies would contain a huge amount of phoenix blood veins.</p>
 <p>At the moment when jet-black flame flourished all across the Fire Bird’s body, golden light also shone on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s body. This caused Qing Shui to feel a bit surprised as he originally thought that there would no longer be any changes to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant was evolved from the Diamond Demonic Boar as a result of it completing its Innate Skills and Blood Veins Awakening, could it be that it was going to go through yet another awakening? Just to what extent could it evolve?</p>
 <p>But Qing Shui was really happy. It was fine as long as it could awaken. It also didn’t matter what it awakened. In any case, once it went through an awakening, it would experience a significant strength boost. This was more powerful than ordinary breakthroughs. He was looking forward to seeing to what extent its strength would reach in a while.</p>
 <p>Kong-kong!</p>
 <p>Minggg!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could tell that there seemed to be a kind of firm tone which resembled that of a dragon moaning noise within the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s howl. The noise itself sounded really beautiful to the point that it could shake one to their core.</p>
 <p>The chirping noise of the Fire Bird on the other hand, became clearer and clearer. The noise sounded so sharp that it felt like it was going to penetrate through the blue dome of heaven. Despite never hearing the actual chirping noise of a phoenix before, Qing Shui felt that it already resembled it. He thought that it resembled a bit of what was referred and described as a phoenix chirping noise based on his previous incarnation. Nevertheless, it was still quite different compared to what he was hearing now. This kind of phoenix chirping noise sounded really pleasant, it was a pleasurable experience.</p>
 <p>It kept going on for roughly the time of an incense stick. During this period of time, both the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird recovered back to their original states almost at the same time. There weren’t many changes to the appearance of either of the demonic beasts, but if one was to observe closely they would notice that the neck of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had become longer and its body resembled metal even more than before. It also appeared to look slightly swollen.</p>
 <p>The color of the Fire Bird got even darker, this time, there was no longer anyone who said that the Fire Bird was colored red. In the past, it was scarlet red but now, it had turned to scarlet black. Judging from the trend, it might eventually turn out to be a jet-black colored Black Phoenix.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui released his Spiritual Sense to analyze the strength of both the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird. Originally, the strength of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was really close to reaching a star but now it jumped straight to achieving a total of three stars. Looking at the slightly extended neck, Qing Shui was quite confused as to what innate skills and blood veins the Diamond Gigantic Elephant possessed. Could it be dragon? He shook his head, in any case, Qing Shui found it really hard to believe as it didn’t resemble one even a bit.</p>
 <p>Three stars worth of raw strength, when under the effect of Diamond Sword Qi, Diamond Protection and other passive battle techniques, it would immediately achieve six stars worth of strength. What made Qing Shui upset was that both the offensive and defensive strength of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had synchronized. They both had three stars worth of raw strength. He was unable to comprehend it, could it be that it would achieve a balanced state of strength once it reached a certain level?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s battle technique only to be dumbfounded. Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection and Diamond Crossing Rivers were all gone. In exchange, it got a new battle technique instead, a passive battle technique.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Force, passive battle technique, permanently increase raw strength threefold. In this case, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would achieve a total strength of ten stars. Furthermore, it was when it hadn’t used any battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Force, Qing Shui was confused for a long time. He once again looked at the current Diamond Gigantic Elephant and found that it truly has become different from before. Its neck had become a bit longer. If one was to observe it from further away, it would be much more obvious.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Force. Was this ability trying to reveal something? It’s just like when the Fire Bird’s battle technique mentioned the word “Black Phoenix” but could the “Dragon Elephant” be a type of species?</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui continued looking downwards.The ability Instantaneous Diamond Evasion got upgraded. It could instantly rush in and kill enemies within five hundred meters. However, Qing Shui felt that this ability wasn’t anything significant when used against a Martial Emperor since five hundred meters was already a range which Qing Shui could travel instantly. Now that he had perfected his Nine Palace Steps, this was even more worthless. But when used against warriors below that of Martial Emperors, it was still quite insane.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Sword Qi was still the same as before, it could lock onto the target and was unavoidable. But the opponent could try to block or resist against it. Under the state of Diamond Sword Qi, the attack of Diamond Ferocious Attack would multiply.</p>
 <p>Diamond Ferocious Attack could originally already increase the offensive strength by one fold. Under the situation when the target also got marked by the Diamond Sword Qi, it could immediately be raised to four times the original offensive strength.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness, twofold of the same offensive attack. It could target at most ten opponents.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it became a group attack, so it’s more like a technique used to open up paths.”</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp, Great Perfection Stage, ten times the raw offensive strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he finished reading through all the battle techniques of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. If he didn’t break through himself, the current Diamond Gigantic Elephant would most likely be his strongest powerhouse. After all, the Mighty Elephant Stomp could achieve an offensive strength of thirty stars.</p>
 <p>But now, because the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s raw strength wasn’t powerful enough, its current most powerful single kill has become stacking the Diamond Ferocious Attack on top of Diamond Sword Qi. It could achieve a total of thirty six stars of offensive strength while the opponent could only try to block and resist against it. It couldn’t be avoided and was strong enough. Unfortunately, it couldn’t be of much use under the current circumstances.</p>
 <p>But Qing Shui was already satisfied with what he had. This was a good beginning. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant awakened its Dragon Elephant Force. Even though in his mind, Qing Shui found that the ability of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was really heaven-defying how long would this last? Some people were born to be ordinary whereas some could just cover up the entire sky with one hand, the same thing should also apply for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, some should be incomparably strong whereas some should only be normal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a feeling that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant might really attain the ability to battle the heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>He turned around and looked towards the Fire Bird which was still flying in the sky. He leaped onto the Fire Bird’s back. The Fire Bird’s raw strength, which was originally one and a half stars had now achieved four stars.</p>
 <p>All along, Qing Shui had always felt that the Fire Bird’s ability wasn’t that strong. Only now did he feel that the Fire Bird should have become slightly more powerful. He eagerly read through the Fire Bird’s Battle Techniques.</p>
 <p>Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens: Passive battle technique, zero consumption, permanently increase raw strength fourfold. All of the battle techniques’ consumptions would be cut in half.</p>
 <p>“Changed, it also changed. Is the Jade Spirited Fruit really that strong? Then the Snow Lion King was very likely to break through to the Martial Emperor Grade using the Jade Spirited Fruit. It’s such a waste.” Qing Shui let out a sigh.</p>
 <p>Superior Flight: The unique flying ability only known by the Fire Bird. Both its endurance and speed were incomparable. It was one of the top techniques among all the flying type demonic beasts. Capable of flying at high speed for a long period of time.</p>
 <p>Hell’s Inferno: The Fire Bird executed a formidable flame attack. The dark flame could burn away everything. It contained terrifying destructive ability. Legend has it that it was one of the powerful battle techniques of Black Phoenix.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens: When the Fire Bird used the Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens, its flame attack’s damage would multiply. This would last for thirty minutes. It could be used four times a day. During this time, the damage it received would be cut in half.</p>
 <p>The number of times allowed to use it in a day doubled. Other than that, nothing really changed. These weren’t actually that important.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved his gaze to the last battle technique, the Phoenix Paradise.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Paradise, at the time when the Fire Bird received critical damage, there was a 30% chance it would go through Firebath Rebirth. Once it succeeded in rebirthing, it would be as if it went through a metamorphosis and its strength would double.</p>
 <p>Under the state of Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens, the Fire Bird would achieve a strength of sixteen stars whereas under the state of Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens, it would be thirty-two stars. Most importantly, at present, Qing Shui still had a really powerful item, the Spirit Gathering Lamp.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Gathering Lamp could now double the damage dealt by the Fire Bird’s flame attacks, that being sixty four stars.</p>
 <p>The mighty Spirit Gathering Lamp, Qing Shui was now really happy. Unfortunately, the progression made by it as of now was really slow. However, it shouldn’t be too far away from ascending a grade. It had been a long time since it leveled up.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui jumped off the Fire Bird’s back, feeling really satisfied. At such a crucial point, the power boost of the Demonic Beast was really important. Even though the effect wasn’t that significant against formidable foes, the majority of warriors in Sky Prison Sect should most likely be ordinary warriors. How many Martial Emperors could there possibly be? Hence, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Fire Bird and the other demonic beasts of his were still really powerful.</p>
 <p>This time, nothing happened to the Thunderous Beast. Qing Shui was determined to continue and fed it two more Jade Spirit Fruit. He noticed that things were still the same except he could sense that the Spiritual Qi within the Thunderous Beast felt really strong.</p>
 <p>Seeing that there were not many Jade Spirit Fruits left, Qing Shui immediately put it away. The fruit seemed to have a really strong effect on people with unique blood veins. The blood vein of the Thunderous Beast was just Thunderous Beast. It might be that ordinary blood veins didn’t contain any powerful species’ blood veins, that was why it couldn’t be awakened.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he immediately laid down on his bed and slept. In the morning, he woke up on time and after going through a simple and quick shower, he walked out of his room. As he stepped out of the house, he could already see Mu Qing arranging a few stones in the courtyard.</p>
 <p>Laying formations!</p>
 <p>This woman was truly hard working. As Mu Qing saw Qing Shui coming out, she happily greeted him.</p>
 <p>There would most likely be no one to bother them today. So they could enjoy a day of peace.</p>
 <p>“How did it go?” Qing Shui walked up to her side with a smile and looked at the stones on the ground.</p>
 <p>“It’s done but nothing is happening with the formation.” Mu Qing looked at Qing Shui with a bitter look.</p>
 <p>“Move the Gan Position horizontally by three meters, the Gen Position up by half a meter, the eye of the formation in the southeast direction by a meter. At the time when you put down the stone of the supporting position, you need to use the hand motion that I told you about. It’s best if you could find stones with Spiritual Qi.” Qing Shui smiled as he passed the colored stone to Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing happily nodded. After that, she rearranged things once more. Then, she placed the stone in her hand into the eye of the formation. Instantly, the Spiritual Qi surged and the formation activated.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing stood within the formation excitedly. The surprised look on her face was indescribable, yet it still looked really beautiful as usual. The expression given out from her bright and beautiful pupils resembled that of the stars in the sky.</p>
 <p>“Duality Steps, remember the usual practice.” Qing Shui charged towards Mu Qing within the formation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to have forgotten about the awkward feelings he had in the past, it might have been because he couldn’t care much about it now. Mu Qing on the other hand, blushed. It seemed like she was also reminded of that time. She bit her lip and quickly avoided him. The technique she executed was a skilled Duality Steps.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spotted Mu Qing’s expression, especially her action from before when she bit her lip and revealed her snow white teeth, it was breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head and once again charged towards Mu Qing. During the entire process, he didn’t stop pointing out to her the things which needed particular attention about formations and explained to her once more about the Sixth Gate and other details…...</p>
