 <p><strong>AST 1130 - Preparation before heading to the four continents, visiting Mu Qing</strong></p>
 <p>Drinks and dishes were plentiful, however it was only Qing Shui and Hu YanLin drinking, Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang were discussing what details to pay more attention to in the future and of course, occasionally teasing the little guy.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was an exceptionally young grandmother, with Duanmu Lingshuang beside her, she only looked a little more mature, her skin and complexion were comparable to her daughter’s. It was as though they were sisters.</p>
 <p>This was not surprising, when women hit their twenties, they would continue having their youthful complexions for about fifty years. This analogy was for normal humans but for those who were innate martial artists, the period would be extended.</p>
 <p>Hu YanLin had never worshiped a person to such extent. If Duanmu Lingshuang was her benefactor, Qing Shui would be the strongest catalyst. Without Qing Shui, he would not have endured and lasted until today.</p>
 <p>Hu YanLin, as someone with a straightforward character, was unable to say any appreciative words but the look on his face and his sincerity could be felt by Qing Shui. He was straightforward but not stupid, he knew what should be done.</p>
 <p>“Mister, I will work hard to let Lingshuang live the most blissful days.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, definitely, if there are any issues that cannot be solved, visit Qing Residence. In conjunction with the Qing Clan, there shouldn’t be anyone threatening you.” Qing Shui lifted his drink, feeling contented.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>As the day was getting late, everyone returned to Fair Wind City. Of course, they traveled with Duanmu Lingshuang and Hu Yanlin. Many members of the Qing Clan knew both of them as they had visited before and left a deep impression. However, everyone knew it was different from before.</p>
 <p>They did not speak out directly but everyone understood, as long as everyone knew they were a family, it would be enough. Qing Shui had the exact same thoughts as well. He knew to enable Yu Ruyan to completely let go, they had to go to the other four continents. Perhaps it would require an even longer time. This is also why he only wanted to bring her to the other four continents.</p>
 <p>He felt that if he was not by her side, based on her temperament she would leave Qing Clan. Since her daughter had her own family now, she would not go back to the Duanmu Clan anymore and would not marry. Hence, he could not imagine the situation, there would not be a problem if he left the house only for a short period or if their relationship was not confirmed. However, everyone knew deep down and it was embarrassing for Yu Ruyan to be here alone.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang happily mingled with the ladies and had a great time laughing and talking. Hu Yanlin hit it off well with Qing You and Qing Zi. Qing Yi enthusiastically held onto Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang as they continued their conversation.</p>
 <p>Qing Qing pulled Qing Shui to a quiet corner and looked at him craftily. Her son was playing around with the other kids and the adults kept a lookout and hence she felt relaxed and wanted to talk to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Sister, what do you want to tell me……”</p>
 <p>“Mother has been spending abundant time with you and I’m sure you’re not lacking in motherly love. I noticed you seemed to like matured beauties,” Qing Qing’s eyes beamed as she replied.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui casually rubbed his nose and smiled with a tinge of bitterness. This question was not new and he had thought about it, even the ladies would tease him about his taste in younger wet nurses...</p>
 <p>“Yes I like matured and knowledgeable beauties, they’re not elderly women, what’s weird about that? Qing You likes them even more…….” Qing Shui replied to Qing Qing dumbfoundedly.</p>
 <p>“Eh, you’re even blushing, you really like Ruyan?” Qing Qing looked at Qing Shui seriously, she seemed to have come to a realization.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Qing was a year older than Qing Shui, in the eyes of outsiders, it seemed as if Qing Shui was the older one. As the saying went, time wears away the youth, the more one has gone through, the more mature they’ll look. Even if their looks seemed young, their eyes would never lie. Just like Qing Shui, through his eyes, it was evident that he had been through alot and undergone many changes.</p>
 <p>“Have you seen me fooling around in any of my relationships?” Qing Shui pinched Qing Qing’s nose.</p>
 <p>Boo hoo!</p>
 <p>Pushing away Qing Shui’s arm, she smiled “That’s nice to hear. My brother’s a hero, Sister Ruyan is nice, I’m happy for you.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was dazzled, he did not understand what his sister was trying to imply. However, he still smiled and replied, “Alright, rest assured. I’m sure you’re clear what kind of person I am.”</p>
 <p>The Qing Clan manor was huge. There were many small courtyards and hence it was spacious and relaxing to stay there. The manor had enough rooms to house many people and to Qing Shui, a bustling and lively household made him feel fulfilled. He loved the bustling atmosphere in his house where everyone was enjoying themselves.</p>
 <p>These few days were hectic for Qing Shui, he visited Hai Dongqing’s residence, Yun Duan’s residence and Di Clan. These families were closely related to Qing Shui and he felt he had a duty to take care of them, maximizing the use of low grade sacred beast pills, in this way if he left them, their combined strength together would be a force to be reckoned with.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, several days had passed, Qing Shui visited every place he wanted to and prepared sufficiently to leave the five continents. Even for Qian Yu Residence and Nian Residence, he had settled them well even though it was less than the others.</p>
 <p>After her morning exercise, Yu He went to look for Qing Shui and said something that made Qing Shui overjoyed.</p>
 <p>“Mu Qing will be arriving soon, do you want to pick her up or wait for her here?”</p>
 <p>“I’ll pick her up!” Qing Shui brushed his hands.</p>
 <p>“Was it very comfortable when you picked up Yun Duan……” Yu He’s beautiful eyes contained a tinge of bitterness.</p>
 <p>That day, Qing Shui brought Yun Duan back home and the ladies could notice the difference in Yun Duan, her expression seemed unsatisfactory…….</p>
 <p>Hence, Yu he could not hold back anymore and decided to speak up.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a little sorry, looking at Yu He, he could only force a laugh and extended both his hands “Don’t let me eat or I shall eat you up today.”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m yours, my body belongs to you but now it’s not the time,” Yu He hugged Qing Shui and muttered.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not force her, he saw there was no one around so he planted a kiss on her and his hands caressed her. It wasn’t long before he had to leave, he had to display intimate affection towards her whenever there is a chance, it was only through this that they could deepen their importance in each other’s hearts.</p>
 <p>“You can go, eastwards, you should be close if you utilize Nine Continents Steps four times. At the most, you will need to travel about half an hour’s time to reach her.” Yu He smiled.</p>
 <p>“We won’t miss each other right?” Qing Shui was worried he would not cross paths with Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>“That won’t happen, please feel at ease!” Yu He tiptoed and gave Qing Shui a peck on his cheek before leaving.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not inform his family members, he believed Yu He would mention it to them. Hence, he used Nine Continents Steps and flew towards the East.</p>
 <p>After using Nine Continents Steps four times, he still could not spot Mu Qing around. He called out his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and continued his journey eastward. He wanted to see Mu Qing as soon as possible, he did not notice his own thoughts of eagerness.</p>
 <p>If Yu He had not let him know Mu Qing was visiting, he would not feel that eager, he would only feel regretful and worried because there was not enough time to go and pick her up. There wouldn’t be such a strong yearning to see her. However, it was different now, he knew he would be able to see her soon and he wished he could see her right now.</p>
 <p>He did not spot her after using Nine Continent Steps four times and immediately called out his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Yu He said it would not take more than half an hour and moreover, his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant traveled at high speed. After about fifteen minutes, he finally spotted a black dot from afar, even though he would see some beasts once in awhile, this time Qing Shui’s instincts told him that that was Mu Qing’s beast.</p>
 <p>Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring to speed up his pace, soon he spotted an enormous Golden Eagle King! It was far and hence he could only see a black dot but on closer inspection, it was a pure Golden Eagle King.</p>
 <p>When he saw the woman riding on the Golden Eagle King, Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing!</p>
 <p>She was wearing a golden colored phoenix pleated dress but the colors did not clash with the Golden Eagle King, the colors were harmonious and graceful. On both sides of her skirt were two colorful phoenixes, they looked vivid and lifelike, portraying her elegance.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing’s figure got clearer and a familiar face appeared in front of Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
 <p>With fine and smooth eyebrows, a gaze like the autumn waters and a figure that was as though it was carved to perfection, standing there was an elegant and independent woman, refined and outstanding. The woman was surprised when she saw Qing Shui, she immediately threw herself onto Qing Shui in a flash.</p>
 <p>It was only when Qing Shui embraced this gorgeous woman that he felt a sense of reality, he pulled her close to his heart.</p>
 <p>“I missed you Qing Shui, I missed you every day.” Mu Qing tightly wrapped her arms around Qing Shui’s neck and whispered while catching her breath.</p>
 <p>“I missed you too, knowing you would come, I couldn’t wait to see you. Have you been well all this while!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I’ve been well and I’ve heard about you wanting to go to Northern Sacred Lu Continent……” Mu Qing softly replied.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>They continued conversing in the air for a long period of time but the longing feeling wouldn’t wear off, instead a fire was lit within them. Of course, naturally, they wanted intercourse. However, they would do it at an inn, below them was coincidentally Jing Yuan City.</p>
 <p>On a soft comfortable bed, Mu Qing indolently laid in the arms of Qing Shui, feeling very fulfilled as she gazed at Qing Shui. She felt shy but she did not evade his eye contact, Qing Shui on the other hand, was playing with her plump and soft breast.</p>
 <p>Occasionally, there would be sounds of Mu Qing’s soft moans and both of them would continue talking on the bed as they did what men and women loved. Sages often regard humans as animals of food and lust, food and lust are natural instincts, natural qualities. Their intense feelings had to be released and this was a perfect example of absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
 <p>“Qing’er, is it more comfortable above or below” Qing Shui teased.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing’s face was flushed red, hearing Qing Shui’s words, she wanted to bite Qing Shui but Qing Shui managed to avoid it and he bent down to bite onto the top part of her plump breast.</p>
 <p>After amusing one another, half a day had passed, they dressed and left the inn. It was impossible to return home today, he had finished using the Nine Continent Steps and since they had not checked out of the Inn, they decided to stay for the night. However, Qing Shui wanted to pass some things to Mu Qing, this woman was also his wife, even if his family was already aware, they hadn’t seen her before.</p>
 <p>He put a Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring on her and had her drip a drop of blood on the ring. He told her how to use the ring and Mu Qing was elated, she was just like a kid, frequently laughing and her elegant laughter traveled through the air.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing’s Golden Eagle King was considered a unique breed, it was a good flying beast. Qing Shui prepared to feed it a medicinal pill.</p>
 <p>Next, Mu Qing’s abilities improved tremendously. After all, Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl, Hallow Pill and the others were reasons why her skills improved staggeringly. Lastly, she used a low grade Sacred Beast Pill to tame a Fire Kirin Beast.</p>
 <p>Everything that had just happened felt surreal, Mu Qing wrapped her arms around Qing Shui and said, “I’m not dreaming, am I? Qing Shui, tell me I’m not dreaming.”</p>
