 <p><strong>AST 853 - Devil, A Promise of Ten Years</strong></p>
 <p>"Most of the people in the village are middle-aged people, old people and children. The youngsters have all gone out. They can't stand the loneliness here and said that they were going to learn abilities and explore the world." The old man let out a sigh.</p>
 <p>Every year, there would be a few people who would lose their lives hunting. If they could pick up some martial techniques, even if they were just simple ones, they would be able to reduce the number of deaths.</p>
 <p>"This is troubling. I'm a cultivator and while I might not be as strong as some powerful experts out there, I'm still much stronger than ordinary people. If you don't dislike the idea, I can teach them a set of martial techniques. As long as the person is willing to put in hard work, they could definitely excel. It'll definitely be better than the martial techniques that they can acquire outside," Qing Shui looked at the old man and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>In one look, Qing Shui sensed that the old man was not weaker than other people. The old man was a Peak Houtian cultivator but it was just that he was in his final years.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, Peak Houtian cultivators were really nothing much. He could even instantly kill Peak Martial Saints he was the same level with, let alone this Peak Houtian cultivator.</p>
 <p>But in this village, a Peak Houtian cultivator was already the most powerful existence. This was also why he was the village head.</p>
 <p>The population here was sparse and with the old man's abilities as a Peak Houtian and his experience in judging people, he could of course tell that this young man was an "expert". If they were lucky, they might be able to change the fate of the entire village.</p>
 <p>"Mister, are you really going to teach them martial techniques?" The old looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. He had not expected this to be so easy.</p>
 <p>"Sir, you can go inform them, including the people from the nearby villages. Everyone can come, no matter their gender or age. I'll teach them for a day. As for how they turn out, it'll be dependent on their own fate. I'll also give all of you a surprise," Qing Shui said after giving it some thought. This was his first day in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent and he had made up his mind to do a good deed. It was said that doing so would make for smoother sailing in the future.</p>
 <p>When he went to the Southern Viewing Continent, Qing Shui had saved Ye Guyan's younger sister. He had also done many of such things in the past but the belief that everything would be smooth-sailing after doing a good deed was not something that was absolute. Usually, he would just do it if he came across them. It was not important whether doing good deeds would accumulate good karma, what was most important was that the heart was good.</p>
 <p>"Alright! I'll thank you then." The old man was very happy and even his hands were trembling.</p>
 <p>By this time, they were already standing before the house!</p>
 <p>"Grandfather!"</p>
 <p>"Grandfather!"</p>
 <p>A young male and female pair in their twenties walked over and called out to the old man happily. They then looked at Qing Shui, eyes filled with astonishment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at them as well. The guy had a stocky and imposing build. He was not only handsome but also was very pleasing to the eyes, making one have a good impression of him. The girl was delicate and pretty, with a pair of big bright eyes. When she saw Qing Shui, a hint of flush appeared on her delicate face.</p>
 <p>"Ao`er, go tell everyone in the area to head to the 玉山村's square. Tell them that it's something good and it's up to them if they want to come or not," the old man told the guy who had called him grandfather.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui looked at the guy, a hint of light flashed in his eyes. He had good potential but it was just that he had a slightly stronger pernicious aura. Qing Shui could not help but drift deep into thought.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, the one earlier was my grandson, Chi Ao. This is my granddaughter, Chi Feng," the old man smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Hello Uncle!" The girl said shyly.</p>
 <p>"Hello!"</p>
 <p>A huge wave was churning in Qing Shui's heart when he saw that both siblings had such a great pernicious aura. Qing Shui's spiritual sense was quite strong now and he could sense some deeper things within the body, such as one's pernicious aura.</p>
 <p>"These two kids have led a tough life since young. Their birth parents were gone right after they were born," the old man said, shaking his head.</p>
 <p>"Grandfather, Feng`er has grandfather with me," the girl tugged the old man's sleeves and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, not saying a word. He did not find it surprising since it was very normal for people with such a strong pernicious aura to have been through something like this. This pernicious aura was the reincarnation of the devil [1]. No one who was related to the person would come to a good end.</p>
 <p>Although these were just rumors, sometimes, they were really unbelievable. Therefore, even if Qing Shui were to trust in these rumors, he would not do so completely. After all, how many people would truly believe what he had been through?</p>
 <p>About an hour later, the guy returned, perspiring furiously. The moment he entered, he smiled and said, "I've informed everyone. Some of them are at the square already."</p>
 <p>"Then let's head over. We don't have much time," Qing Shui suggested.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then we'll have to trouble you," the old man smiled and said happily. He was near the end of his life but he was still worried about the two children with him. They had good potential but it was just that no one could appreciate them, nor did they come across any opportunities. Having met Qing Shui this time, he decided to gamble on it.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to stand on ceremony, I'm the one who's willing to do this. This place feels very familiar to me. I've also live for a very long period of time in a similar environment and have also seen many people hurt by wild beasts." Qing Shui shook his head. These were really his heartfelt words.</p>
 <p>Very soon, the four of them arrived at the square.</p>
 <p>玉山村's square was just a flat spacious space at the foot of the mountain. The place was higher in the middle and lower in all other areas. When it rained, water would flow out in all directions, leaving not a single drop behind.</p>
 <p>There were some stone chains, hammers and other things at the square and about 30 people were there, mostly children and middle-aged people. There were also a few who seemed to be in their twenties and more people were still gradually heading over.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this place, he could not help but recall the square back in Qing Village. He had also spent a very long time there back then.</p>
 <p>"I'll demonstrate it once for everyone while we wait for other people to arrive." Qing Shui said to the people in the square.</p>
 <p>Then, not waiting for any reaction, he displayed the Tiger Form. He performed each stance slowly but the smooth flow and the strong power of his movements made them felt very excited.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui performed it time and time again and many people were looking at it seriously, for fear of missing out on any of the steps. The other people who gradually came also joined in.</p>
 <p>When it was about time, Qing Shui stopped and looked at the less than 100 people in the square. There were about twenty who were at Chi Ao's age, with at most around 60 middle aged men, with the others being slightly older people.</p>
 <p>After giving it some thought, Qing Shui said slowly, "Earlier, I told the village head that I'll be giving you guys a small gift."</p>
 <p>He took out the Tiger Vitality Pill and gave one to each of them. "If you can trust me, then take it. If not, then forget about it."</p>
 <p>Some people were hesitant but Chi Ao and Chi Feng ate it immediately. Their actions caused the other people to not give it much thought and just took the pill.</p>
 <p>After the time for one incense stick to burn passed...</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I feel that I seem to have more strength," a brute middle-aged man said doubtfully.</p>
 <p>"Old Liang is right. I have the same feeling too."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"To think that my strength has increased by so much..." Someone suddenly raised up a huge stone chain which he had never been able to lift before.</p>
 <p>His action astonished many people. Everyone knew one another well and while the man was considered one with quite a high brute force, he would only be able to lift a 200 jin stone chain at most. However, he had now lifted one which was 600 jin and had done so with great ease since he was still talking.</p>
 <p>"The medicinal pill you guys have just taken can permanently increase your strength by 1,000 jin. However, this is just the upper limit and since all of you have different physiques and absorb at different rate, you'll be able to have your strength increased by 500 jin. Those whose physiques are better may get an increase of 900 jin," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>After he had finished talking, all of them broke into elated expressions. It felt exceptionally good to be able to have the feeling of instantaneously becoming stronger. Moreover, the Tiger Vitality Pill also had the slight effect of strengthening one's bones and changing one's physique.</p>
 <p>They all tried it once and had by now, completely trusted Qing Shui. All of them looked at him in admiration, full of anticipation over the next surprise he was going to bring them.</p>
 <p>"In a while, I'll teach all of you the Tiger Form battle technique which I've displayed earlier. When it reaches a certain extent, you'll be able to cultivate the Tiger Form Qi force. What level you'll reach for this battle technique will be dependent on your efforts. If you're willing to work hard for about ten years, there'll definitely be people amongst you who can become Xiantian cultivators or even stronger. You'll find out in the future," Qing Shui said gradually. These words were intended to let them work hard in their training. Even if his martial arts were to be passed on, in the future, if he came across it, it would also be able to bring him a sense of satisfaction.</p>
 <p>He then demonstrated and explained each move and stance to them in turn and got them to try them out. This session also let Qing Shui see Chi Ao's and Chi Feng's astonishing talent. This was only astonishing to Qing Shui. The other people would definitely not be able to believe that this was their first time cultivation martial techniques. Everyone all thought that the two of them had practiced with Qing Shui earlier.</p>
 <p>There was boundless potential within them and as Qing Shui watched them practicing the Tiger Form, his thoughts were churning at great speed.</p>
 <p>"In the future, you guys must work hard in your training. If there's anything you're unsure of, you can ask them," Qing Shui said while smiling and pointing to Chi Ao and Chi Feng.</p>
 <p>These people all bowed respectfully to Qing Shui, calling him 'Teacher' before they left. They've all received something good from Qing Shui and it was very normal for them to be calling him that.</p>
 <p>Chi Ao and Chi Feng also went back to train, leaving only Qing Shui and the old village head.</p>
 <p>"Sir, do you hope for the two of them to become strong?" Qing Shui asked calmly.</p>
 <p>The old man looked at Qing Shui very long before he then sighed and said, "The two of them were abandoned and back then, many people said that they were bad luck. The moment they were born, all of their kin died. They are a pair of twins and since I'm alone by myself, I brought them back with me. In the blink of an eye, 20 years has passed."</p>
 <p>"Then do you want them to stay here forever or to go out?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"I don't have that many years to live. It might be fated for them to have met you this time around. It's better to let them go!" The old man sighed and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, you can rest assured," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the old village head returned to the houses and found a place for Qing Shui to stay in.</p>
 <p>Chi Ao and Chi Feng returned in the evening. When they saw Qing Shui, Chi Feng happily called out, "Uncle!"</p>
 <p>"Uncle!" Chi Ao also greeted him.</p>
 <p>The old village head left.</p>
 <p>"Do the two of you want to become strong?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Their tone sounded very sure and was also filled with a strong hope.</p>
 <p>"It's very tough for people who are strong."</p>
 <p>"We're not afraid to work hard!"</p>
 <p>"Then I'll help you stimulate your potential, strengthening your foundations."</p>
 <p>In the time that followed, Qing Shui applied acupuncture on them and stimulated the pernicious aura in their bodies. It was a type of mysterious energy and was very powerful. As they grew stronger, so would this aura. Under such a pernicious aura, those who were not strong enough would be scared out their wits.</p>
 <p>After stimulating their potential for about two hours, Qing Shui even used the Five Elements Fruit and other medicinal pills to help them strengthen their foundations.</p>
 <p>"Work hard in your training in the future. I'll leave medicinal pills behind. You can decide your own paths for yourselves. After ten years, if the two of you wish to follow me, then come look for me at Greencloud Continent's Heavenly Palace!"</p>
 <p>[1] Used something of a similar implication for the translation. The raws actually stated one who was a reincarnation of the Tianshagu Star, a star that flickers between being very bright and very dark. The star is along the straight line between the fourth and seventh stars of the Big Dipper. It is said to be a sign of great misfortune and people whose life/fate were linked to this star were said to bring great misfortune to the people around them.</p>
