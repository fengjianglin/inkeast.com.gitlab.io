I am your woman so what's the need of feeling jealous. Jin Liyu is just a child who hasn't matured." Yiye Jiange said shyly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I am also a child who hasn't matured, I want to suck breasts..."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his words made her blush, making her look at him with anger. Qing Shui on the other hand blinked as he licked his lips with his tongue, his eyes gazing towards Yiye Jiange's perky bosom.</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Since you've agreed, why don't we go at it now?" Jin Liyu's mood seemed anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu's manners made Qing Shui feel unwell a little previously. If it was before, he'd have become angrier but he couldn't now as the counterpart was a Beastman and he had realized from Yiye Jiange's words that there was something wrong with this Jin Liyu's brain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"3rd Palace Master, let's finish fighting first or else the food will go cold." The person who said this was the Chief of the Mermen, Dyne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"3rd Palace Master, Qing Shui is the husband of the 2nd Palace Master and is the guest of the Sea King’s Palace. This is quite improper to do." The Black Scales Merman Liang Tenglong also commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you afraid?" Jin Liyu looked towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui scratched his head as he walked outside: "Let's fight outside. It seems you won't stop until you're taught a lesson. You're actually so rampant with just your trivial skill?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Jin Liyu's nature, Qing Shui's words fanned the flames of anger, making him come outside following after Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Jiange, what's to be done?" Muyun Qingge smiled helplessly. This matter was really a bit hard to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I already told Qing Shui not to kill him." Yiye Jiange was also helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're quite confident that Qing Shui will defeat him." Muyun Qingge looked at Yiye Jiange curiously. Speaking the truth, she felt Qing Shui was quite mysterious and was also her life-saving benefactor. She only knew that his medical expertise was quite high but didn't know anything about his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I believe in him. Let's go take a look so that there aren't any casualties. It's a difficult time for the Sea King’s Palace now. The most important matter for us right now is beat back both the Sea Dragon and the Vicious Shark Palaces." Yiye Jiange pulled Muyun Qingge outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Begin!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that there was no easy way to deal with a person like Jin Liyu; even his speech manners before were bad so the best way was to directly knock him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Okay!" Jin Liyu was quite straightforward and directly soared up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Jin Liyu did so, Qing Shui had already reached above him, waiting there for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu's strength was quite considerable so Qing Shui didn't dare to be careless, after all they were in water and had already left the Sea King Palace's sealing barrier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was just like a fish back in the water so there wasn't any need to speak about Jin Liyu. His figure suddenly grew, revealing a mountain-sized figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More terrifying than this transformation ability was that all Beastmen had a recovery skill. Along with the increase in strength, a huge whirlpool, an underwater typhoon so to speak, appeared beside the giant Jin Liyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Take care as I won't be holding back." A voice came out of the giant Jin Liyu's mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Attack. Even if you're big, you're only a carp." Qing Shui took out the Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strength burst out from his body. The current Qing Shui possessed terrible strength. He brought the strength of his body to the peak as he wanted to defeat Jin Liyu quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Jin Liyu's body was huge, it moved quite nimbly in the water. Its huge tail came thrashing over. The water not only didn't obstruct but instead seemed as it was being pushed, giving Jin Liyu's tail an extremely destructive aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sensed that he'd be unable to dodge it so he didn't move at all. He used the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand and even used the Phoenix Finger as well as the Nine Stances of the Ancient Battle Technique to counterattack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't influenced by the water as he had the Paragon Water Shield with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dazzling gold radiance appeared from the Golden Battle Halberd as it hit Jin Liyu's huge tail. The Golden Battle Halberd had a 1% percent probability of penetration and adding the Nine Stances of the Ancient Battle Technique's 3%, although this probability was quite unreliable, appearing not even once in several hundred attacks but sometimes appearing twice in succession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it had appeared this time, taking Jin Liyu's attack head on made his figure unsteady, making him groan. If it wasn't for the Paragon Water Shield, Qing Shui would've been hugely affected in water, but it was nothing to him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roaming Dragon Steps!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's figure dashed ahead, unceasingly attacking with the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand. There was no trouble for Qing Shui's defense to resist Jin Liyu's attacks, therefore he could directly attack Jin Liyu without fear and that brazen and extreme sensation gave quite the kick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu felt quite gloomy now; this was a monster with human form. Beastmen's physical bodies were a lot stronger than humans, but right now, he felt that there wasn't any difference between their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Koi Domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu's giant body moved as a giant bright colour water field appeared in the surroundings. Qing Shui could sense that his body received some kind of restriction in this area which inhibited his speed, agility, and resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling wasn't that intense but it influenced him greatly. Qing Shui now understood this Jin Liyu's terrible ability, because he discovered that even he couldn't get rid of this state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange had mentioned before that this Jin Liyu had a big role in the Sea King’s Palace. It seemed that not only the formation but this Koi Domain of his was also useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it influenced him, it meant nothing to Qing Shui. What Qing Shui didn't know was that it was only him who felt this way. If it was any other cultivator, they'd receive a terrible influence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The things which Jin Liyu relied on the most were the Koi Domain and the Koi Dragon Gate Formation. Using these two together allowed the Sea King’s Palace to resist the combined attack of the Sea Dragon Palace and Vicious Shark Palace with great difficulty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It's a pity that Jin Liyu had encountered Qing Shui this time. Qing Shui looked at the bright water with a smile. To destroy a person's faith, one had to make their ultimate skill seem worthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Berserk Paragon Attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor's Qi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Jin Liyu feel as if it had fallen into a quagmire immediately. He looked at Qing Shui who was dashing over with utter shock and what followed after was a single-sided cruel fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sounds of explosions sounded out along with Jin Liyu's howls mixed inside them till Jin Liyu had entered the sealing barrier and taken human form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't hit me... I admit defeat...I admit defeat..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu was battered and begged for forgiveness. Qing Shui's bad mood vanished like smoke as he looked at Jin Liyu with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu shivered a little, confronting that gaze. Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange almost wanted to laugh when they saw this. The others all looked Qing Shui with astonishment as this youngster's strength was quite formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You really admit defeat?" Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Really. Be at ease. Since you defeated me, I'll obey you and do whatever you say." Jin Liyu didn't make any complaints. Even Qing Shui couldn't figure out whether he was acting or meant those words, but Qing Shui felt that he meant what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beastmen were like this. Strength was above all else for them and if only a person had strength, they'd be glad to work for them. Since Qing Shui had defeated Jin Liyu with his strength, it was quite normal for him to admit defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pulled him up: "You are the 3rd Palace Master of the Sea King’s Palace and not an outsider. There's still time so come, let us brothers have a toast."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu was dazed as he said happily: "You really wish to become my brother? But you're a lot stronger than me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who says that one must look at strength to become brothers? If everyone did that, no one would be able to associate with others. To become brothers, they need to be kindred spirits. I feel you and I can be called as kindred spirits." Qing Shui said seriously. He also didn't know why he said this as the counterpart was a Beastman. But he wasn't saying this casually. Jin Liyu had quite the strength and fighting together with him as a friend seemed good. Moreover, Qing Shui felt that with Jin Liyu's temperament, they could become friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Okay. That's really good. From now on, you're my Elder Brother." Jin Liyu said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt especially good about this aspect of Beastmen. Qing Shui also patted his shoulder with a smile and didn't address him. Not to speak of the age of a Beastman, even among cultivators, it was those reaching the paramount stage earlier who were considered elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others saw that the development was quite peaceful and felt happy, because they knew that the most important matter for the Sea King’s Palace now was about the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace. Although they were war-like, they didn't really want to see either Qing Shui or Jin Liyu die while fighting against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning to the dining table, the mood was quite better. Everyone felt envious, knowing that Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange were husband and wife, but they could only feel that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've already obtained the news. At most in half a month, the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace will again come to attack us with the determination to win." Yiye Jiange looked around and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"They've already attacked us several times. Though we were passive, it isn't so easy for them to swallow us." Jin Liyu frowned. The gloom on his face had already disappeared at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We can't be careless and we might not necessarily lose." Muyun Qingge smiled, intentionally looking towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu's gaze brightened: "If Elder Brother Qing is there, we can definitely win. His battle skill is quite magical."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu had sensed Qing Shui's terrifying battle skill personally and not speaking of his destructive power, just the ability to weaken the enemy was quite terrible. If Qing Shui attacked together with Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange, then they could quickly defeat the opponents’ leader.</span></p>
