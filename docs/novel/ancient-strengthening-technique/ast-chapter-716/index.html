 <p><strong>AST 716 - Recipe for Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill, Fourth grade Immovable Mountain</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t wait to take a look at it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt Hammer!</p>
 <p>As it turned out, this hammer was known as the Thunderbolt Hammer across the World of the Nine Continents. Qing Shui felt that it was better to call it ‘Thunder God’ to showcase its tyranny but since it was just a name, Qing Shui didn’t want to keep thinking about it and continued looking down.</p>
 <p>The Thunderbolt Hammer was forged from the Thunder Stones at the summit of Heavenly Cloud Mountain. One Thunderbolt Hammer could help double all of the user’s abilities but this effect would not stack.</p>
 <p>Additional Battle Technique Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt: Using it could make the enemy fall into a paralyzed state. The duration of the effect depends on the enemy’s strength. It could be used every fifteen minutes.</p>
 <p>So the battle technique was known as the Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt. As expected, it was the battle technique attached to ‘Thunder God’. Qing Shui was really happy. If he was to pair up the Thunder God with the Heavenly Thunder Slash which he already possessed, the result would definitely turn out to be really good. If he was to use the Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt at the same time, the effect would most likely increase.</p>
 <p>Condition needed to use it: abilities cannot be less than three thousand countries.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui already felt contented with what he had and put down the Thunder God. This unexpected present was very valuable to him. After that, Qing Shui took a look at the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, that was in the distance and walked over to it to check out the cards, that he had not seen yet, in it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t really have mach expectations for the crystal card that’s formed from the Four Eared Shadow Mouse. After all, its strength was only decent, he never thought that he would get any sort of powerful subsidiary battle techniques.</p>
 <p>He took up the Four Eared Shadow Mouse’s crystal card.</p>
 <p>Effect: Speed increase by 100% for fifteen minutes. Effect can be stacked with battle techniques of similar type. Within the fifteen minutes, there’s a fixed chance of dealing critical damage to opponents.</p>
 <p>He was dumbfounded!</p>
 <p>To his surprise, it was yet another powerful and unexpected harvest! It could temporarily raise the user’s speed by 100% and its effect could be stacked with other battle techniques. Merely this was already powerful enough, not to mention it still had the ability to cause critical damage. The only problem with it was that it only happened by chance, just like the paralysing effect of Heavenly Thunder Slash.</p>
 <p>The effect was almost the same as the bracelet that he refined. Qing Shui took a look at his arm that has been empty for a long time and thought to himself that it was time he forged another bracelet. After all, a bracelet which helped increase destructive power was not bad.</p>
 <p>He put away the Four Eared Mouse Crystal Card and dedicated himself to cultivating. During this period of time, he also refined a few medicines since he would soon be getting the recipe for Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill.</p>
 <p>Time was short already, thus, Qing Shui was really looking forward to seeing the medicinal pill which could help strengthen meridians. People who practiced cultivation cultivated nothing but their body and qi. For cultivating qi, it meant cultivating the Qi of Xiantian in one’s Dantian and meridians whereas for cultivating body, it meant cultivating skins, tendons, blood and bones…...</p>
 <p>In terms of cultivating bodies, Qing Shui felt that he wasn’t inferior to anyone. The Ancient Strengthening Technique was precisely the strongest technique to cultivate body and qi. Now that the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill showed up and its recipe needed a huge amount of experience to obtain. It would surely have a great effect. The Ren Meridian and the Governing Vessel were the two most important meridians in cultivation.</p>
 <p>Time went by slowly. Qing Shui spent most of his time on refining medicines everyday in the hope of getting the recipe as soon as possible and have a look at its effect.</p>
 <p>Soon, a month passed. During that time, Qing Shui went out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal once. At around 12 o’clock in the night, he went back in immediately to continue his medicine refining practice.</p>
 <p>Spirit Concentrating Pill, Aroma Concentration Pill. As for the others, either he had no medicinal herbs for them or he had no use for them for the time being. Hence, he basically stopped refining those medicines after saving up a few of them.</p>
 <p>Also, on his return trip to Di Clan this time, he got as many living medicinal herbs as possible from Yuan Su to solve his worries. The Vital Essence Pill, Gale Pellet and Jade Green Pellet were indeed quite useful.</p>
 <p>Yet another ten days passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A noise that was comparable to that of a heavenly music triggered an incomparable excitement in Qing Shui. Nevertheless, he held it in and waited for the Jade Green Refining Pill that he was refining to finish. In any case, it was almost done.</p>
 <p>As soon as he refined the Jade Green Pellet, Qing Shui stopped and didn’t bother to refine anymore of it. He couldn’t wait to immerse himself in his sea of consciousness to take a look at the recipe for Ren Meridian Strengthening Pills.</p>
 <p>The Ren Meridian was one of the formidable meridians of the Eight Extra Vessels of the human’s body. The Ren Meridian controlled the body’s strength and defense . By cultivating the Ren Meridian to a certain level, the person would be able to increase their physical strength and defense.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew about this because he would experience the same effect from his normal cultivation. He never expected there to be vague descriptions about the Ren Meridian in his sea of consciousness. He hurriedly took a look.</p>
 <p>The Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill could rapidly strengthen Ren Meridians.</p>
 <p>Recipe for Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill: Black Ember Flower, Energy Enhancing Fruit, Five Elements Fire Fruit, Five Elements Metal Fruit, 5000-year-old Turtle Blood, 5000-year-old Lingzhi, 5000-year-old Starmoon Flower, and 5000-year-old Icewater, Peak Martial Saint Grade demonic beast’s inner core, Peak Martial Saint Grade beast’s tendons, Peak Martial Saint Grade blood, Rainbow Trout Fish, Vermilion Fruit, Peach of Immortality, Golden Bull Grass, 5000-year-old Five Qi Sun Grass, Nine-Headed Lion Grass, 5000-year-old Sky Penetrating Grass, Eight Immortals Grass and 5000-year-old Sunflower. The herbs that had an aged requirement could only be more and not less.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui’s eyes swept across the descriptions, he spotted the effect of Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill, it could help raise the user’s raw strength by 50 to 100% depending on how much the individual could absorb. At the same time, it would help to open the Tiantu Acupoint.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui had also begun to feel troubled. So many medicinal herbs were needed. Even though he was able to find more than half of it, for things like the Black Flame Grass, the Five Thousand Years Starmoon Frass, Golden Bull Grass and Nine-Tailed Lion Grass. He has heard about them before, but they were really difficult to find.</p>
 <p>For example, the Golden Bull Grass, Nine-Headed Lion Grass and other beast form grass, they’re all quite precious. As soon as Qing Shui saw the list, he immediately became very anxious.</p>
 <p>As for the inner core, tendons, blood of Peak Martial Saint demonic beasts, they’re equally as rare, but at least Qing Shui had his ways to look for them. Qing Shui shook his head as he knew that he would need to spend a long time to refine the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill.</p>
 <p>He continued to look further.</p>
 <p>He was a million medicine refining experience away from acquiring Governing Vessel Strengthening Pill.</p>
 <p>It seemed like later on, the Strengthening Pills for the remaining few meridians would be unlocked. The Ren Meridian had control over one’s strength, in other words, their physical power. Qing Shui knew quite a lot about the Eight Extra Vessels. As for the Governing Vessel, it was used to control and practice Qi. For example, once the Governing Vessel, Qing Shui’s Primordial Flames attacks would similarly get stronger.</p>
 <p>If his Primordial Flame’s strength was to multiply by several times, its strength would definitely be terrifying….. Unfortunately, as soon as he thought about the ingredients and medicinal herbs needed for Ren Meridian Prescription, Qing Shui felt defeated. He had no choice but to look for and slowly accumulate them.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui woke up really early on the next day. He has been feeling particularly energetic for the past two days. The main reason for it was because of ‘Thunder God’. After all, anyone would be happy if their strength was to be doubled. They would even smile in their dreams when they were sleeping.</p>
 <p>Morning practice!</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Taichi Fist!</p>
 <p>Immovable Mountains!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui used the Immovable Mountain, it surprisingly broke through on its own. The Immovable Mountain which has halted in progression for a considerably long time has actually broken through at this moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui managed to figure out the reason behind it right away. This was somehow related to the ‘Thunder God’. With the Thunder God, Qing Shui felt a lot more confident than before. Even the aura he released had become a lot stronger. This kind of confidence was precisely what was needed for Immovable Mountain, to keep calm in even the most dangerous situation and take in everything, an aura which could stand up against everything.</p>
 <p>Good things indeed come in pairs. Qing Shui calmed his mind and patiently practiced his Taichi Fist. He was feeling so joyful, even to the point he even felt a slight improvement in his Taichi Fist.</p>
 <p>“After a while, Hai Dongqing walked out. It had merely been a night and her hand was no longer a hindrance. It turned out that Qing Shui’s Golden Medicinal Salve was still quite effective. With the strength of a Martial Saint as a boost, it helped the injury to recover at an unusually fast rate.</p>
 <p>“Wake up, is your hand ok already?” Qing Shui saw that the skin on Hai Dongqing’s hand was already smooth and soft. There was only a faint trace of a scar, that should heal after a short period of time.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine already.”</p>
 <p>“See, everything is fine now.” Hai Dongqing slowly walked towards him and extended her hand to Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui already knew at the moment she confessed her feelings to him. He gently grabbed her snow white hands and looked at the one inch pink scar on her palm and backhand. That was a scar left behind by a dagger.</p>
 <p>And she got that all because of him. Qing Shui gently fondled the scar while Hai Dongqing trembled because of the numbness and the wonderful feeling that she felt in her heart.</p>
 <p>She gently took a step forward. Now, she was basically already really close to Qing Shui. A delicate fragrance which resembled that of an orchid went into Qing Shui’s nose.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing lowered her head slightly and allowed Qing Shui to grab one of her hands as he wished. She really wanted to hug Qing Shui at the moment, but after taking the first step forward, she found it really hard to take the second step. The last time he hugged her was because they were in that kind of circumstance. In fact, it was a subconscious act of hers, it was because she was deeply moved by him and thanked him a lot.</p>
 <p>This time however, she wasn’t able to do anything. Her heart was beating really fast and she didn’t dare to look at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He never thought that such a beautiful girl like her would also have this side. He gently held her in his embrace. At this moment, Qing Shui felt really calm. He didn’t have the slightest bit of sexual intention. It was a mutual feeling they shared with each other.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing hugged Qing Shui tightly. Her entire body also loosened up. The two didn’t say anything. They only hugged each other quietly while feeling each other’s heartbeat.</p>
 <p>“What do you like about me?” Qing Shui was confused. Prior to this, she has said that she wasn’t interested in arrogant children.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know… Suddenly, I feel really, really comfortable with you. I enjoy the feeling of having you by my side. It’s something really hard to describe… It’s my first time feeling this way with a man… I like talking to you… Even if we’re to only stay together and not talk……” Hai Dongqing said gently at a very small volume.</p>
 <p>It’s affection!</p>
 <p>The feeling she had for him was only just affection. Wasn’t it a bit too late for her to experience this for the first time? She was already so old, yet this was her first time having good feelings for someone of the opposite gender…...</p>
 <p>It’s coldness…...</p>
 <p>After the two had their breakfast, Hai Dongqing told Qing Shui with a smile: “Let me bring you to Ice Statue City to have a look around. That place is beautiful.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded with a smile.</p>
 <p>Ice Statue City was a beautiful spot in Cold Ice City. It was an ice world; ice trees, ice houses, everything was made of ice. There were a lot of people moving back and forth in that city because they enjoyed watching the scenery there.</p>
 <p>After two hours, both Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing arrived at Ice Sculpture City.</p>
 <p>The first thing that entered Qing Shui’s sight was a door and castle wall. This was a small city. The Ice Sculpture City was also known as Ice City. This place was a subsidiary city in Cold Ice City. It was really similar to Qing’s Village in Hundred Miles City. It was considered a second-grade city.</p>
 <p>There were guards in front of the castle door. At the moment when they saw Hai Clan’s cart, they bowed down their heads to greet them with an unusually respectful look. Prior to this, Hai Clan has always been treated this way. Ever since that happened, Hai Clan’s name was passed on throughout the entire Cold Ice City within one night.</p>
 <p>At present, Hai Clan was a formidable clan. Even though Luo Clan and Du Clan had fallen, there would quickly be other clans to replace them. But no matter what, they would never be comparable to Hai Clan in terms of strength.</p>
 <p>It wouldn’t matter even if Qing Shui left. As long as he was alive, no one would dare to lay hands on Hai Clan for the time being.</p>
