 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the fervent gazes in the surroundings which even seemed to contain a passionate reverence. He felt especially comforted by it. This was the feeling an expert felt. Receiving others’ admiration was a wonderful thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone had already left and said he’d tell this news to all the people of the Sea King’s Palace, making everyone feel happy. Soon, cheering resounded from outside and kept increasing. The dissemination of the news was quite fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu was also sitting here, but he was a bit absent-minded. Besides Qing Shui, Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge, none of them knew the reason. The battle this time was led by Qing Shui and most importantly, the Carp Tribe had also contributed a lot. Although it wasn’t to the extent of Qing Shui, their contribution wasn’t negligible or else the Sea King’s Palace might’ve had big losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood up and raised his wine glass: “It makes me happy to defend the Sea King’s Palace together with everyone. Jiange is my wife and the Sea King’s Palace is her home. Everyone here is like my brothers and sisters. Though I cannot stay here at all times, I’d never ignore the Sea King’s Palace distress. Let us work hard together for its future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cheers!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them picked their wine glasses and bumped them with Qing Shui’s cup. The scene and everyone’s mood became exceptionally lively. A person’s spirit feels pleasant when feeling happiness and this was a huge happy occasion for the entire Sea King’s Palace, as its strength was bound to increase several fold due to Qing Shui joining them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, they still didn’t know that Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge’s strengths had received quantitative leaps. It was a pity that the Sea King’s Palace never had a Guardian. The Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace both had Guardians and though they didn’t appear much, rumours were spread often and their existences had been confirmed to be true this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, the Sea King’s Palace also possessed a Guardian, and a young one at that. He was stronger than the Sea Dragon and the Vicious Shark Palaces’ Guardians. For now, the entire Ice Ocean Domain belonged to the Sea King’s Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu was feeling regret right now, but there was no medicine for that in the world. One had to take responsibility for his actions. Although Qing Shui had said that he wouldn’t investigate it, that was nothing more than a joke. Who’d be able to forgive this kind of vile matter?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Jin Liyu didn’t believe that Muyun Qingge, Qing Shui and the rest would easily forgive him. He was also waiting for this day. He’d accept the decision no matter what it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The celebration banquet had already begun, yet they hadn’t declared how they’d handle him. This only made him feel more restless. He wasn’t afraid of death, but the wait before it was quite awful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could naturally make out Jin Liyu’s uneasiness, but he still wore a smile on his face. Qing Shui’s seat was near Jin Liyu’s, but he didn’t even look at him. This made Jin Liyu feel that he was really finished this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, each one of them retired as it was getting late. They knew that the Palace Masters must have matters to discuss. After one left, the rest followed. Jin Liyu alone didn’t leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was normal that he didn’t leave, as he was the 3rd Palace Master and should’ve remained behind normally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Palace Master. The matter has already happened. Please declare how you are going to handle it. My heart’s becoming anxious like this.” Jin Liyu couldn’t bear it anymore and stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge laughed: “Who said we’re going to handle you? Your hypocrisy took the enemy by surprise and brought great merits to our Sea King’s Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu shook his head: “Palace Master. You don’t need to comfort me. I only wish that Palace Master allows the Carp Tribe to follow you as this matter is unrelated to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When did I say I’d hold them accountable?” Muyun Qingge said calmly, without even looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main reason Jin Liyu was like this was because he was a spy and had also schemed to obtain Muyun Qingge. This was the reason he felt anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Palace Master will really let the Carp Tribe off?” Jin Liyu asked excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m giving you two choices now. First, your Carp Tribe becomes independent, matching with your previous desires. Second, you can stay behind in the Sea King’s Palace, but if something like this happens again, don’t blame me then. Also, you aren’t the 3rd Palace Master from now on, so don’t harbour any thoughts towards me.” Muyun Qingge looked at Jin Liyu with a cold gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aura coming from her made Jin Liyu tremble. He understood that the disparity in strength between him and Muyun Qingge was quite big. Men from the Beastmen tribes didn’t like their women being stronger than themselves, even if they were beautiful, as that would be a kind of humiliation for them, making them feel uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge’s cold gaze and words had already told him what he should do. He nodded in stupefaction: “Thank you. I’ll take my leave first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu left in a muddleheaded state. His heart couldn’t stabilize itself after its delusion was shattered, just like how one felt when the women he loved secretly got married.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Palace Master wants to make the Carp Tribe work hard for the Sea King’s Palace but also wants to deprive Jin Liyu’s position as the 3rd Palace Master.” Qing Shui looked at Muyun Qingge with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Carp Tribe is quite important for the Sea King’s Palace. The Sea King’s Palace is moving up right now, so it can’t separate from the Carp Tribe temporarily. Jin Liyu had become the 3rd Palace Master by relying on his ancestor’s accomplishments, and many people didn’t like this. The Carp Tribe’s contributions were better than the others so nothing could be done. It’s fine now. There’ll be no position of 3rd Palace Master from now on. Only I and Jiange will be the Palace Masters.” Muyun Qingge smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like this in the world of Beastmen. Even if someone possessed an extreme military force, some things needed to be thought out. Muyun Qingge was from the Drakaina Tribe, whose wisdom was on par with humanity and was higher in strength. They were pets of heaven and earth. But the life of such a woman was filled with crisis as many men aimed for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How many powers exist in the Ice Ocean Domain?” Qing Shui pondered for a bit before asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The world of sea tribes is similar to humanity’s. It’s just that the sea tribes possess a larger area and the water domains are divided into upper and lower layers. It’s said that there is a total of 18 layers and each circle is dominated by a power. Every small power is supported by a bigger one, which is supported by one bigger than it. The relations between the layers are complicated and tangled. Therefore, it is possible for an unremarkable existence in the underwater world to cause a butterfly effect and provoke a huge inconvenience, even bringing about a disaster ending in slaughter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are there any powers behind the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace then? Does our Sea King’s Palace have someone supporting us?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know whether the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace have patrons behind them, but our Sea King’s Palace doesn’t have anyone’s support. Others don’t know this, but I’m sure they’d think twice now before taking any actions.” Muyun Qingge smiled at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you say that?” Qing Shui looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because you’re here. People will believe that an existence like you has the support of a Immortal Sect behind you. Even an Immortal Sect might not be able to cultivate a person like you. Therefore, they’ll believe that the power behind you is an existence on the same level as an Immortal Sect and possibly a top one among them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was dazed. The term Immortal Sect was mentioned again. According to legends, Immortal Sects possessed Divine Grade existences, Without a Divine Grade expert guarding it, it simply couldn’t be considered an Immortal Sect. He had already heard about this subject of Immortal Sects several times now. The top of the pyramid of the Nine Continents was the struggle between Immortal Sects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Qing Shui think about the Five Tiger Immortal Sect. He didn’t know how far it was from the Divine Grade, but he knew that it was difficult for the current him to encounter any of them as his strength wasn’t enough right now. He was also sure that there weren’t that many Immortal Sects among the several big Sects, just only that one Immortal Sect he knew od.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing behind me though.” Qing Shui forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re even better than an Immortal Sect.” Muyun Qingge said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think too highly of me.” Qing Shui engrossed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I believe my gaze and intuition and I’ve never been mistaken. You’re a person of my Sea King’s Palace, since you’ve become its member. Don’t think of leaving it for your entire lifetime.” Muyun Qingge said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui. When are you planning to leave? What are your plans?” Muyun Qingge was quite interested about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to stay here for a few days and then return to Linhai City. I have no plans for later.” Qin Shui was reassured about the Sea King’s Palace now so he explained it to her straight. He didn’t know whether the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace had another power behind them, therefore he was planning to stay here for a few days and also help the Sea King’s Palace prepare a little in passing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days passed by in an instant. Qing Shui remained at the Sea King’s Palace all along, enjoying his luck with women. He cultivated together with Yiye Jiange during daytime and conveniently helped to open and reinforce her channels. He gave her a few medicinal pills, an Ancient Demonic Fruit, and also a Dragon Pellet to see if she could use them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Yiye Jiange wasn’t a Drakaina, she wasn’t lacking compared to one. Adding onto the skill of the Portrait of Beauty, she was on par with a Drakaina and probably even a bit stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Yiye Jiange’s strength had increased greatly and so had the strength of the Nine Headed Crystal Beast. After stabilizing, the Yang Pill also raised her strength again, greatly increasing her endurance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the aspect of battle skills, Yiye Jiange possessed her own unique battle skills, which came from a Drakaina’s battle skills. Qing Shui still gave her the Phoenix Finger and a few other suitable battle skills. The movement skill he left behind was the Nine Palace Steps, as it could blend together with other movement skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps due to the inheritance, the Nine Palace Steps was kind of exclusive to Qing Shui and others found it difficult to learn to the same level as him. This made him feel unwell, as he wished for his close ones and friends to become powerful too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although just three days had passed, Yiye Jiange’s and the Nine Headed Crystal Beast’s strength had increased a lot. She had broken through another level in the Nine Palace Steps in these three day, which was an unexpected surprise. Her battle skills were multi-varied, and mainly relied on heavy hits. Hence, speed was an important factor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the 4th day, Muyun Qingge arrived there. She felt an indescribable feeling when she saw their intimate appearance.</span></p>
