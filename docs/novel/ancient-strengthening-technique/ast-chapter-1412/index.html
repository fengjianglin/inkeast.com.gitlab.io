 <p><strong>AST 1412 - Mystical Gate Formation, Demon Lord Palace’s First Elder</strong></p>
 <p>The burly man finally believed Qing Shui’s strength, that was because Qing Shui saw through the fact that his strength was equivalent to that of Eternal Spring’s Second Elder. This observation was better than his own.</p>
 <p>“There’s a risk of injury if we fight, brother should be careful.” The burly man was very frank, as he turned towards Qing Shui and said seriously.</p>
 <p>“Come!” Qing Shui smiled as he gripped both fists. The burly man was a body strengthening martial artist, his natural talent was also very good. To be able to guard the gates of the Demon Lord Palace, he was not some simple gatekeeper.</p>
 <p>A gatekeeper here was many times stronger than the elite martial artists in the imperial palace. They were False God martial artists. Though it sounds derogatory to call them gatekeepers, in reality they were overseeing and protecting this region.</p>
 <p>With a strength of 10 million sun, it was more than enough to oversee an area. Thus, Qing Shui did not dare to underestimate this burly man. He looked as though he was quick on his feet but he was also quick to react with his wit.</p>
 <p>Eruption Fist!</p>
 <p>What the burly man cultivated was fire element category Eruption Fist. Standing on the opposite side of Qing Shui, the moment he gripped his hand into a fist, his hand doubled in size and became red as a flame. The two fists looked like two pots.</p>
 <p>The burly man was very honest. The people surrounding them were watching attentively. The burly man was the strongest here, the others all followed his orders.</p>
 <p>“I will attack now!”</p>
 <p>The burly man didn’t waste any time, right after finishing what he said he struck his fist towards Qing Shui. Using roughly 70% of his strength, with subsequent force to follow up, he could chain the next attack with his full strength at any time.</p>
 <p>Condensed energy shaped into two giant red fist prints was fired towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed as punched back.</p>
 <p>Back Connecting Fist!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui condensed his energy into the shape of fists, moreover he was using the Flames of Yin-Yang, which was Primordial Fire. He absorbed the fist the burly man fired at him. Qing Shui also did not hold back, his figure flashed to the left rear of the burly man.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>One punch made the burly man walk three steps forward. Qing Shui’s physical force was not as strong as the burly man but Qing Shui’s speed, angle, accuracy and footwork allowed him to use less than half of his strength in this one punch.</p>
 <p>When the burly man was able to stabilize his figure and engage in a counter attack.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already waiting for him with another punch. The force in this punch was 10% stronger than the last one.</p>
 <p>Bang Bang…</p>
 <p>The other people watching only saw how the burly man was being punched back and forth like a sandbag. At the beginning the burly man was angry and embarrassed but after he calmed down, the number of times he was sent flying was reduced…</p>
 <p>At the end, the burly man was tired to the point where he was panting like a dog, “I can’t fight any longer brother, I won’t be able to thank you enough. I could have made the decision to let you into the Demon Lord Palace but you are too powerful, I will need to report to the higher-ups.”</p>
 <p>“Natural course of things, brother, then your purpose here is to prevent people from entering the mountain?” The mountain that Qing Shui mentioned was the inner mountain of Moyun Mountain. That was the real Moyun Mountain, where the Demon Lord Palace resided.</p>
 <p>“Actually this is just a somewhat important junction point. It would be pointless to break in even if we were not here. People who were not members of Demon Lord Palace would only get lost.” The burly man showed a bit of fright when he got to this point.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised, “Is this a formation or is it a hidden gate?”</p>
 <p>“Mn, brother you understand quite a bit. I, myself, am not sure about this. It is probably those two things you mentioned. I am a brute, so I made the choice be the gatekeeper, the further in you go, the more abstruse it becomes.”</p>
 <p>The burly man’s name was Li Batian!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to laugh after hearing his name, it was a very imposing name but it was a bit stupid. He did not say what was on his mind but smiled as he said, “I am Qing Shui, nice to meet you brother.”</p>
 <p>“You come from the Phoenix Dance Continent, Imperial Cuisine Hall’s Miraculous Doctor Qing?” Demon Lord Palace’s information network was superb. Though they had not met Qing Shui in person, they had heard of Qing Shui’s name but did not have his portrait.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again noticed that he had a bit of a reputation. Divine Sound Sect knew of his existence, now even Demon Lord Palace knew of his existence.</p>
 <p>At least now he knew. Imperial Cuisine Hall, his medical techniques and his battle with the Left Custodian and Che Clan, had he missed one of those he would have been neglected. It was the combination of these incidents that made the powers notice him but it was only noticing him.</p>
 <p>Once things were settled, Qing Shui followed Li Batian into Moyun Mountain.</p>
 <p>Li Batian felt that Qing Shui was not simply here to join Demon Lord Palace, even if he did kill people from the Eternal Spring Palace. Eternal Spring Palace resided in Soaring Dragon Continent, one Eternal Spring Palace probably can’t deal with him.</p>
 <p>Just that Qing Shui had not mentioned the reason, so he did not bother asking. After all, there was another person in his way. All he had to do was to send him over to the First Elder. Any martial artists that were beyond the False God Realm but wanted to join the Demon Lord Palace would have to be sent to the First Elder’s.</p>
 <p>“Brother, your potential is unlimited, I have walked this path before. I hope you will go down the proper path. Brother, do you know anything about Demon Lord Palace?” Li Batian asked while walking.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had faintly felt his intent, he was probably worried that Qing Shui was a spy. Qing Shui smiled and said, “Brother, please elaborate.”</p>
 <p>“Demon Lord Palace is regarded as an Evil Power by the outsiders but brother probably knows, to our members, the Demon Lord Palace is a sacred ground. The outsiders call our palace lord as the Demon Lord but to our members, she is a divine woman,” Li Batian said slowly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not reply, he listened quietly.</p>
 <p>“In the wasteland of the three continents, the four powers are not weak, since they have to fight with the Soaring Dragon Continent. If they did not have some strength, they could not hold their ground. Those who call themselves righteous are simply hypocrites, we would not sink to their level,” Li Batian said angrily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had seen Eternal Spring Palace’s people, of course it could not be said that everyone was like those of Eternal Spring Palace. If that was the case, then the World of the Nine Continents would really have changed.</p>
 <p>Only having a few of these powers was enough. Even more righteous sects would contain some bad seeds, moreover, the two powers were already in opposition from generations ago. With each generation, they probably forgot what enmity they had, they only remembered who their enemies were and they would try to find any opportunity to bring the other down.</p>
 <p>Once he entered the inner mountain, Li Batian told Qing Shui, “Follow my footsteps, if you are lost, I will not be able to find you.”</p>
 <p>“Mn, alright!”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui first entered, he could sense what was happening. It was similar to Mystical Gate Escape Arts. This area was littered with mountain rock and forestry, travelling within, it would seem very normal. However, if the person entering stepped the wrong way, it would activate the formation. This was similar in structure to Qing Shui’s Illusionary Formation.</p>
 <p>It would seem that this Demon Lord Palace had some really highly skilled martial artists protecting it, they were highly knowledgeable in Mystical Gate Formation.</p>
 <p>On the path, there were mountains and trees in the scenery, as well as vegetation and trees. However, these were all weapons that could kill someone. After an hour of walking, they finally stopped on top of a small hill, this place was an isolated small manor.</p>
 <p>Two strong man standing by the door saw Li Batian and greeted him courteously, “Elder Li!”</p>
 <p>Li Batian was an Elder of the Demon Lord Palace, anyone who was False God Marital Realm would be an Elder of the Demon Lord Palace. Birds of a feather flock together. Now that Qing Shui entered the False God circle, he would have to approach people of this level. This was his strength. If it had been his strength from before, he would never be able to approach the people he was approaching now.</p>
 <p>“Is First Elder here?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, he said if you came you could go directly in.”</p>
 <p>Li Batian nodded and took Qing Shui with him to the courtyard.</p>
 <p>This manor did not have anything special about it. It looked very simply decorated, there was not an ounce of lavishness. The courtyard had many simple and unadorned rocks and also some dazzling flowers and plants. Once Qing Shui saw the flowers, they triggered his thoughts.</p>
 <p>Formation, the way the flowers were positioned had to be a formation. Moreover, it was super refined. Qing Shui could conclude, the formation that was on the path outside of the manor was a product of the First Elder or had direct relation to the First Elder.</p>
 <p>Passing through the courtyard, they saw an old man standing in the middle of some planters. Moreover, in his surroundings were several pots of planters, it was tender and beautiful and incomparably bright here.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui could confirm that, not only was the First Elder’s strength a bottomless pit but his other abilities were equally formidable. For example, the Elder was a formidable Formation Master.</p>
 <p>“Left three, forward five, retreat six, right one push three, forward five steps, return left four…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said casually, the Elder heard his voice but was confused. After thinking for a bit, he followed Qing Shui’s instructions. He had already failed countless times.</p>
 <p>In reality, the continuously failing Elder had sensed there must be other methods to the madness. For example, maybe what Qing Shui said was correct but he quickly dispelled this feeling. However, he still followed Qing Shui’s instruction and did as he was told. He had already failed so many times, so failing again would not matter.</p>
 <p>However, the result left him with a big shock or perhaps he was in disbelief.</p>
 <p>Success!</p>
 <p>Flowerwood Spirit Formation!</p>
 <p>Recently, the Flowerwood Spirit Formation that he had been researching for a while suddenly became a success. He raised his head towards the direction of the voice that gave him instructions. He saw a familiar face and a stranger.</p>
 <p>Li Batian was the familiar face but his sights were set on the young man next to him. This was a bewitching and quick-witted young man, he gave off an unfathomable aura of danger or maybe it was a mysterious aura.</p>
 <p>After being stunned for a bit, he walked out with a light smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“First Elder!” Li Batian greeted respectfully.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Li, come!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Elder, this was an aged but intelligent old man. He looked kind, easy going but wise. The Elder wore very plain clothing, with a slim figure and white hair. His body gave off an aura that was neither obsequious nor supercilious. However, no one would miss his presence but neither would it make people uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>“Young man seems to be well versed in Mystical Gate Escape Arts, I do not remember Demon Lord Palace having a young man such as yourself,” the First Elder said amiably.</p>
 <p>“First Elder, he is Imperial Cuisine Hall’s Miraculous Doctor Qing. Because he killed the Second Elder of Eternal Spring Palace, he wants to join the Demon Lord Palace.”</p>
 <p>The First Elder brightened up and smiled, “Oh, that’s the case, not a problem. Xiao Li go do your things, I will talk to Mister Qing.”</p>
 <p>Li Batian left.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Doctor Qing, lets speak openly shall we?” The First Elder smiled towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“How can I approach the Palace Lord or rather the Demon Lord,” Qing Shui thought and then answered.</p>
 <p>“Good, you’re very honest. I want to know why you want to approach the Palace Lord, I believe you are not a spy for another sect.” The First Elder looked at Qing Shui and suddenly realized he could not see the fluctuations within his heart.</p>
