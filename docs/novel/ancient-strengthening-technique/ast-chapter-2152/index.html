 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The following days went by very calmly. Qing Shui treated patients and guided Zhang Yue on his medical skills. Without realizing it, three months passed by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these three months, Qing Shui's Stellar Transposition kept on improving. Right now, its weakest attack was at 20 billion Dao Force. Right now, the chances of an attack of 40 billion Dao Force appearing had increased by a lot. This made Qing Shui very happy. Most importantly, his Stellar Transposition had suddenly broken through a certain level three days ago. There was previously a need to have a cooldown of 7.5 minutes between each use, but now it was at five minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Stellar Transposition, which previously could be used twice within 15 minutes could now be used thrice in the same amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Stellar Transposition would also be a weakness to many of its users, even if they were to have quite good defenses. One of the flaws was the long cooldown duration. After all, it was an attack enhanced by one's defenses. When the enemies' attack was high, they would also be relatively resistant to attacks. Therefore, this battle technique was one which adhered to the natural rhythms. The only problem was that during the cooldown, the user could die many times over. Therefore, even if one were to learn this, you wouldn't waste too much time nor hold too much expectation on it. Otherwise, it would only mean to wait for death to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had never thought of this before. After all, due to his own abilities, it wasn't that difficult for him to drag out the time. Therefore, he was the only one who could change the Stellar Transposition into a paragon-like technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui was overjoyed because the cooldown had been reduced to five minutes. After all, the time was shortened by one-third.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this discovery, Qing Shui was filled with even more hope. He wondered if the cooldown would be shortened to two minutes with the next breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he were to attain a few more breakthroughs, he would be able to use it even more freely. If his defenses were to become even more powerful, then wouldn't the attacks be too terrifying? An attack that could bypass the opponent's defense was too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite so, Qing Shui was very satisfied. He didn't care how many times he could use it. It only mattered that he could kill the opponent with a single blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these three months, the Imperial Cuisine Hall's reputation grew even higher. Another thing was the Divine Palace. Right now, there was no one who would dare to look down on the Divine Palace. Not only was the Old Golden Battle God powerful, but there was also a younger Battle God who could actually kill the Firecloud Palace's Grand Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the powerful old Golden Battle God had outspent his time, a new generation expert had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, there's a new piece of information. Do you want to hear about it?" Nuo Lan found Qing Shui and asked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why don't you just say it?" Qing Shui couldn't understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"A beauty has appeared in the Northern King Domain's Immortal Cloud City." Nuo Lan smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's so strange about that? There are too many beauties. You are a beauty yourself." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This beauty can be a match for Beihuang Fan. However, she is an icy-cold goddess. Moreover, this beauty seemed to be trying to find out about the Five Tiger Immortal Palace. Do you think that she has some feud with them?" Nuo Lan asked out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A casual remark might sound significant to a suspicious listener. Qing Shui frowned, "Where is she right now? Are you able to find out about that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why, do you know her?" Nuo Lan asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I feel that this lady could be my wife. The reason I've been trying to find out about the Five Tiger Immortal Palace is also for her." Qing Shui felt very anxious now. Although Tantai Lingyan was quite strong, she was still unable to face up against the Five Tiger Immortal Palace. Moreover, she was a Demon King Inheritor. If the people from Demon Gate were to find out about this, there would probably be more problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She was currently in the Immortal Cloud City’s Drunken Immortal Inn." Nuo Lan knew that Qing Shui was very anxious and said it outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thanks. I'll go and take a look." Qing Shui got up and was prepared to set off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let me go with you!" Nuo Lan gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm able to find out about her location at any moment." Nuo Lan continued to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded. She was in charge of the intelligence for the Divine Palace. The two of them didn't pack anything and headed straight for the Northern King Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they weren't that far away from the Northern King Domain, Qing Shui had the Nine Continents Steps so they arrived in no time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wouldn't be bad to use the Flying Sword to travel either, but he wasn't planning on using it in a while. Moreover, its grade was still very low and its speed wasn't that high compared to the Hellfire Phoenix. Therefore, he rode on the Hellfire Phoenix and rushed towards the Immortal Cloud City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, she's fine now. However, there are now many people who've set their eyes on her. The reason is that she is too beautiful. Therefore, if someone were to say that she belonged to the Northern King Domain, then the Northern King Domain wouldn't lose out to the Northern Emperor Domain in terms of the place with the greatest beauty." Nuo Lan said jokingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. To think that the Northern Emperor Domain and the Northern King Domain would compare even this aspect. Beihuang Fan was a unique existence in the Northern Emperor Domain. Not only was she beautiful, but she also had an unrivaled disposition and cultivation level. Therefore, in the short term, it would be hard to find an existence that could be compared against her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They only arrived at the Immortal Cloud City the next morning. The Drunken Immortal Inn had already appeared in the distance and Qing Shui could already see it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Drunken Immortal Inn's prosperity made Qing Shui speechless and there were many people in the surroundings. Just then, another group of people appeared. There were about 200 of them, and the person in the very front was a handsome young man. This was not all, the young man's cultivation was very strong and an extremely pure and surging demonic aura came from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nuo Lan saw this man, she spoke in a soft voice, "He is the younger brother of Demon Gate's Junior Sect Master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'd thought that he was the Junior Sect Master. To think that he's the Junior Sect Master's younger brother," Qing Shui said this, but it sounded a little weird...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just then, the young man looked toward the Drunken Immortal Inn and said, "We're the same type of people, and I like you a lot. No matter what conditions you are suggesting, I'll agree to them. I'll only love you in this lifetime."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui heard this young man's words, he was sure that the other party was Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Master, why don't we barge in and capture her? This is already the fourth day yet she's not even willing to meet you." A young man said in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I really like her and want her to be my wife. I'll only marry her." The demonic man said seriously.</span></p>

It's because Young Master loves her; that's why you can bring her back first. She'll eventually understand you and be touched by your sincerity. And when that happens, she might be able to understand that Young Master had made the right decision to capture her," the young man continued on.</span></p>

However, I'll deal with this matter myself. You guys can wait here," the demonic young man said this and then headed to the Drunken Immortal Inn.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her hair was tied up and she had beautiful brows. She didn't wear any makeup on her beautiful face and had the appearance of a goddess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a beautiful figure and her snow-white plain clothes couldn't hide her curves. Her shoulders were sharp like blades, and the arch before her chest was breathtaking. Her waist seemed to be smooth as silk, and her slender figure was beautiful like a great jade carving masterpiece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She exuded an aura which made one feel that she mustn't be tainted. Amongst all the ladies Qing Shui had come across, she was the one who was the hardest to get close to. It wasn't due to the fact that she was cold, but rather it was an air of arrogance that came out from her soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was just as cold and magnificent as before, having the same arrogance and indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan landed softly on the ground and looked toward a direction as if she had sensed something. It was the place where Qing Shui and Nuo Lan were at; thus, she immediately looked towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hint of surprise flashed in her cold and beautiful eyes. There was also a hint of softness in them as she smiled softly. The people around all went into a daze when they saw Tantai Lingyan's smile. They were all stunned by her beauty. They didn't even realize that saliva was dripping off the corners of their lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The traces of saliva were left hanging due to them opening their mouths for too long amidst the great surprise and astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Nuo Lan sighed and said in surprise, "To think that she has such a beautiful smile. Oh, right, is she your wife?"</span></p>
