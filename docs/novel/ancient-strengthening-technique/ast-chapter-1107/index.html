 <p><strong>AST 1107 - You Want To Be A Rider…… Primordial Flame Explosion</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped. When the Nine Continents Mountain exploded on the ‘Golden Ni Lion’, more than half of the people were instantly killed in the explosion without leaving even a trace behind. There were actually more than a few hundred Martial Emperors among them…...</p>
 <p>The remaining ones here included those who had performed the Spirit Transmission earlier. Each and every one of them seemed mentally exhausted at this very moment. Their faces were ashen. They had lost. Losing meant that their lives were no longer in their own control. Their life or death was now completely at the whim of others.</p>
 <p>Only about 300 people were left among more than 500 people. The explosion of Qing Shui’s Nine Continents Mountain on the Golden Ni Lion had eliminated about 200 cultivators and all of them were of Martial Emperor grade. On top of that, they were the more powerful ones among these 500 people.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put away the Nine Continents Mountain before walking slowly over to the old men across from him. Only three of them remained. Although the leading old man, who was dressed in the silver robe embroidered with a golden lion, seemed mentally exhausted, he was still alive.</p>
 <p>“Old man, I’m sorry that you all have been defeated!” Qing Shui wasn’t smiling and wasn’t smug either. He looked as if he had done something very normal. It was as if he had already expected this kind of outcome.</p>
 <p>In fact, this outcome was really within Qing Shui’s expectation. However, this was nothing worth him being smug about.</p>
 <p>The old man rose slowly. He seemed exhausted but had a very calm expression on his face. He was even wearing a faint smile on his face. “I have said this before. I have no regrets even if only these old bones of mine are left here today. It’s been so many years. A young man like you that is as brilliant as a firework is very rarely seen, even in the other four continents. There’s nothing to be regretful about being your stepping stone.”</p>
 <p>“Old man, I admire your spirit. I believe that you are sincere. Do you have anything you want to say? As long as it’s nothing too crazy, I can agree to it,” Qing Shui told the old man indifferently.</p>
 <p>At first, Qing Shui was thinking of exterminating them. But after reconsidering about it, it didn’t seem to be the best option. The Beitang Clan was going to be destroyed anyway. By then, the master of the Lion King’s Ridge would be replaced and everything was going to change.</p>
 <p>“Young man, do you think I can not be crazy with my request at a moment like this? But since you have offered, I will say what I want to say. Otherwise, I will miss my chance to do so since I’ll be dead later.” The old man smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>“Please go on.”</p>
 <p>“The Lion King’s Ridge has a very powerful background. Of course, you are very powerful too. However, if you have used your full strength today, then you won’t be able to shake the Lion King’s Ridge up. Other than that, I wish that you will let them go. Their cultivation hasn’t been easy and they have a very long time to live ahead of them. If you can let them go, I will let them part with the Lion King’s Ridge and leave here or follow you.” The old man spoke very slowly. His eyebrows were knitted tightly together.</p>
 <p>The rest were silent. Each and every one of them had a very grim look on their face!</p>
 <p>“The three of us will end our own lives here, for the sake of paving your path ahead!” The old man looked at Qing Shui and spoke once again.</p>
 <p>“Old man, can you answer me one question?” Qing Shui pondered for a moment before asking.</p>
 <p>“What is it? At this point of time, I will tell you everything as long as I know, regardless of whether it should be spoken of or not.”</p>
 <p>“How is the Beitang Clan?” Qing Shui looked at the old man, without blinking.</p>
 <p>“The Beitang Clan used to be a very powerful and very accomplished clan. However, they haven’t actually been better over these few years. They are declining every generation. Even so, a starving camel is still bigger than a horse. Besides, they still have some old men to rely on for protection,” the old man answered slowly.</p>
 <p>“I understand. I can only say that the Beitang Clan needs to be exterminated. I can spare the rest and all of you old men don’t have to die either. I will not make things difficult for you. After I have exterminated the Beitang Clan, you all may vote among yourselves again. You get what I mean, right?” Qing Shui said slowly to the old man.</p>
 <p>“Understood. This old man, Du Yannian and every one of our 300 remaining men would like to express our gratitude to you, sir,” the old man said earnestly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. Old man of their age were most concerned with some of their future generations. They had a reputation of their own. Judging from this old man strength alone, his clan members were definitely no commoners in the Northern Sacred Country. This old man was making his position known to him.</p>
 <p>“Old Man Haotong…”</p>
 <p>……….</p>
 <p>“All you need to do is to rest and recuperate. Besides, I’m guessing that news of you all not stopping me will travel to those people’s ears very soon. Help me find a person who is suitable to take over the Lion King’s Ridge. It’s best if that person is one of your people,” Qing Shui explained</p>
 <p>The three old men’ expressions changed but they still gave him a nod!</p>
 <p>At the wave of his hand, Qing Shui summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. He nodded at the few old men before he helped the few ladies up the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and flew in the northern direction. This battle had allowed Qing Shui to get to know quite a number of existences. The five continents definitely had terrifying existences among them.</p>
 <p>Other than that, the beasts that those people had tamed earlier were ineffective against cultivators like himself. After all, not even Yiye Jiange’s Seven-headed Crystal Beast was effective against him, let alone their demonic beasts which were far more inferior to the Seven-headed Crystal Beast.</p>
 <p>Although they were greater in number, most of their demonic beasts were simply not enough to kill Qing Shui in a flash. Only the few old men had more powerful tamed demonic beasts but there was still a great disparity between their strength and Qing Shui’s strength. The things that truly made the Lion King’s Ridge powerful were their formations and battle techniques. Of course, their tamed beasts also contributed to this but only as part of the overall strength. When it comes to dealing with peak or extremely powerful cultivators, those tamed beasts were nothing but mere decorations. However, the Lion King’s Ridge definitely had formidable tamed beasts, such as the Golden Ni Lion, which also worried Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, can you not kill so many people next time? Our main target is only the Beitang Clan from back then.” Yiye Jiange told Qing Shui who was beside her when they were riding on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I shall listen to you. Didn’t you see how many people I’ve spared today?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“I was so worried!” Yiye Jiange gave Qing Shui a serious look.</p>
 <p>She stared at Qing Shui with her eyes that were as gorgeous as the universe, as if trying to read his mind or the feelings in his heart.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui reached out and pinched her straight and jade-like nose. It was as fair as a white jade and as beautiful as a piece of art. He almost felt like planting a kiss on it. “Alright, I know what you are worried about. Rest assured, everything will go well. When that time comes, you will have to do what you have promised me,” he laughed.</p>
 <p>“What have I promised you……?” Yiye Jiange was slightly perplexed.</p>
 <p>“On the night of our wedding, you promised me that you’ll take the initiative and strip yourself for me. You said that you want to be on top of me and be the rider……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui chuckled softly beside Yiye Jiange’s ear.</p>
 <p>“Pervert. You bastard…... ”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange pushed Qing Shui away and instantly fled with a flaming red face.</p>
 <p>Di Qing and the few ladies smiled while walking towards Yiye Jiange, as if asking her something. They also threw some strange glances at Qing Shui from time to time, making him feel a little uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>They flew continuously over half a country. This was the most silent period Qing Shui had ever experienced. The defeat of those 500 Martial Emperors must had caused many of them to refrain from striking out at Qing Shui. There were no signs of any of them.</p>
 <p>In the skies above the Northern Sacred Country’s northern city gate!</p>
 <p>There were already about fifty old men standing there. All these old men were dressed in silver colored robes, with the same image of a golden lion embroidered on them. It seemed like Du Yannian was considered the most powerful being among the Lion King’s Ridge.</p>
 <p>The fifty old men stood in the midair as they watched the party that had come riding on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant with great interest. They simply couldn’t wrap their heads around the fact that the party who had defeated the Lion King’s Ridge was this band of young people.</p>
 <p>“Old sirs, you all must have waited for a long while here. It is really an honor for me.” Qing Shui cupped his hand in respectful greeting while he soared into the sky from the back of Golden Scaled Elephant and stood in the midair, across the fifty old men with some distance between them.</p>
 <p>“It’s no bother. It’s shocking to know that Du Yannian and the rest didn’t manage to stop you all.”</p>
 <p>A refined and polite old man stepped forward from the crowd of old men. He had a medium-build and was quite lean. The robe he was dressed in brought out an air of nobility and Integrity around him.</p>
 <p>“How may I address you, old man?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Name is only but a form of address. Everyone calls me Beitang Demon,” the old man chuckled.</p>
 <p>“So you are from the Beitang Clan.” Qing Shui’s tone of voice changed slightly.</p>
 <p>“Haha, that’s right. At least half of the people here are from the Beitang Clan. Why? Are you afraid?” Beitang Moren never once broke his gaze on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“That would mean that all of you were also involved in the incident with the Yiye Clan from back then?” Qing Shui asked calmly.</p>
 <p>“Why bother asking these questions? Do you think that a reconciliation is still possible between all of you, the Beitang Clan and the Lion King’s Ridge? Young Master Beitang was probably killed by all of you in the Ancient Ruins, right?” Beitang Demon had a faint smile on his face while saying all this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect this refined old man, who even had the air of nobility and unquestionable integrity around him, could turn into a demon in the blink of an eye. The smile on his face had practically destroyed all his earlier impressions on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He now understood why everyone called him the Beitang Demon!</p>
 <p>“That’s right. It’s been too long, it’s about time for things come to an end.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hand as soon as he finished speaking. The Nine Continents Mountain became bigger and appeared above him. He then used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and raised the Qi Force in his entire body to its peak.</p>
 <p>GO!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain charged towards the people across them in lightning speed as soon as Qing Shui’s Sword of Sixth Wave landed on it!</p>
 <p>Lion King’s Spirit!</p>
 <p>The fifty old men across from them immediately lifted their arms. A wave of dark red Qi Force directly collided head on with the Nine Continents Mountain, knocking it back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He knew that he had no chance of winning if he solely relied on the Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Roc's Might!</p>
 <p>Tens of Descending Heavens Talismans were sent out at the wave of his hand!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Although the Fiery Golden Eyes lacked in control, his spirit energy was formidable now so he was treating this as an opportunity to practice it. The Descending Heavens Talismans could somewhat weaken them, but the other talismans were pretty much useless on these kind of strengths.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>After weakening them with the Emperor’s Qi, Qing Shui disregarded the look of shock on their faces and launched the Nine Continents Mountain once again, followed by a powerful stomp of his foot.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Although the Mighty Elephant Stomp was not as effective in damage now, it still had another powerful effect. There was a certain probability in stunning the target.</p>
 <p>Petal Rain Under the Skies!</p>
 <p>The Coldsteel Bead in Qing Shui’s hand was launched out. All this happened within a split moment. Qing Shui’s figure flashed!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps Great Reversal.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flames Explosion!</p>
 <p>A gigantic gray colored fireball charged into the crowd across from them, with an enormous wave of destructive aura. It then exploded when it charged out from within the scattered crowd.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Although the Primordial Flame Explosion was powerful, it required some time. Qing Shui had used this to destroy his opponents’ plan in setting up a formation.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Energetic Primordial Flame Dragons were unleashed from both of his hands!</p>
 <p>Demon Binding Ropes!</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Whip!</p>
 <p>Bam!</p>
 <p>……….</p>
 <p>In the mere space of two breaths, more than half of the fifty people were dead. When Qing Shui found out that most of the people here were from the Beitang Clan, he decided to massacre them all at lightning speed. It was so fast that they didn’t even have the chance to get into any formations.</p>
 <p>Most would only be instantly killed by Qing Shui’s mighty spirit energy’s attack, not to mention that the strength of his opponents had also been weakened by quite a lot.</p>
