 <p><strong>AST 802 - Baima Qiufeng, A Very Easy Battle?</strong></p>
 <p>Fiery Meteor Shower!</p>
 <p>Although the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear wasn’t too strong or at least not strong enough for these people, they still didn’t dare to get a taste of those falling fireballs with their own bodies.</p>
 <p>Even when Qing Shui was in the middle of a battle, he would still constantly monitor Luan Luan’s movements closely. He had put away Thunderous Beast after it had unleashed Thunderbolt on a few elderly men.</p>
 <p>With their speed reduced a little and Qing Shui’s weakening effect, the entire battle seemed to have fallen very easily into his control.</p>
 <p>It did seem very simple but it was because Qing Shui had cultivated for very long time to achieve such outcome. If it was converted to the time within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, the days he spent on cultivation would be too overwhelmingly long. On top of that, his cultivation arts were wide-ranging and profound. It was no coincidence for Qing Shui to have the achievement he had today.</p>
 <p>Everything was the outcome of Qing Shui’s hard work. The Baima Aristocrat Clan was inferior to the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan. However, what they didn’t know was that Qing Shui had eliminated the Eastern Palace Clan solely by himself. If they did, they wouldn’t dare to provoke him no matter how courageous they were.</p>
 <p>Baima Qiufeng, the Old Ancestor from the Baima Aristocrat Clan, was really regretting this right now. It was a disgrace that there were already casualties in the Baima Aristocrat Clan. The moment he laid his eyes on the youth, he had already sensed killing intent and the potential danger lurking within the youth. This was why he had decided to strike first without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>But he had no idea if it was a wise decision or a mistake. The decision he had made was spilt water that could not be taken back. He had no other choice but to fight until his death today.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan sat on the back of Fire Bird. Fire Bird would constantly breathe out powerful Nether Balls. Qing Shui had also ordered the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to stay beside Fire Bird and perform a Mighty Elephant Stomp from time to time. This was quite destructive.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan had the Crimson Dragon Bow that Qing Shui had given to her before in her hands. She would shoot at the few elderly men from time to time without much expectation as her attacks were all dodged by them.</p>
 <p>“Old and useless. Not only that, you’ve made such bad decisions. I wonder how you will face your ancestors.” Qing Shui snorted coldly as he shot out a 1,000 Years Frosted Iron Ball from his hand.</p>
 <p>Meteor Smash!</p>
 <p>The moment he forced the old man to fall back, he suddenly dashed towards the remaining few elderly men while yelling out to Luan Luan to watch out. A gray flame suddenly materialized in between his hands and quickly formed into a fireball. He then unleashed it towards his opponents.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant performed a Diamond Sword Qi followed by a Instantaneous Diamond Evasion before it dashed towards the elderly man who had been locked on. The rest attempted to attack the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, however Qing Shui’s Primordial Flame Ball had already caught up to them.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The elderly men that had been locked on were powerless to resist and were sent flying by Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s attack. On top of that the Primordial Flame Balls that had been scattered collided against each other right at this moment.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant had already left long ago. The disintegrated Primordial Flame Balls scattered in all directions. Although the opponents had scurried backwards, two unfortunate elderly men’s necks were scorched and they died instantly on the spot.</p>
 <p>One of the elderly men who moved backwards got into trouble with Luan Luan’s seven Earth Devouring Mice instead. The pitiful elderly man’s eyes widened in fright. Although he struggled with all his might, it was difficult for his weakened strength to resist the attacks of the Earth Devouring Mice.</p>
 <p>Baima Qiufeng was so pissed that he almost vomited blood. He abandoned Qing Shui and rushed towards Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already on his guard. There was no way he’d let him do as he wished. Two Primordial Flame Balls were sent to block Baima Qiufeng’s way. The opponent evaded them and pressed onwards.</p>
 <p>Three 10,000 Coldsteel Needles arranged in a triangular formation were shot out towards the elderly man. At this moment, he was already standing in between the elderly man and Luan Luan as he calmly sent out a Descending Heavens Talisman.</p>
 <p>It was a Descending Heavens Talisman with perfect accuracy, only that the effect wasn’t really that impressive.</p>
 <p>There were only six elderly men left, including this Old Ancestor of the Baima Aristocrat Clan. Qing Shui was less pressured. This clan was powerless in the face of Five Colored Poison. If his opponents could withstand his Five Colored Poison, he would really not have any chance in winning.</p>
 <p>“Evildoer… You are an evildoer!” Baima Qiufeng shouted loudly. By now he had witnessed the consequences of the Baima Clan and was shouting unwillingly.</p>
 <p>“What comes around, goes around. You should be aware of this.” Qing Shui told the old man in a cold voice.</p>
 <p>“To think that you actually used poison this way. I have miscalculated……” Baima Qiufeng’s words were pale and weak.</p>
 <p>Some poison in the World of the Nine Continents were gaseous but they had a spreading process. People with stronger strength would be able to evade because the more poisonous poison were usually vibrant in color, unless they couldn’t move.. As long as a Peak Martial Saint cultivator could move, he would be able to evade this with no difficulty. Other than that, trying to poison a Martial Saint through their respiratory tract was basically futile because they were able to hold their breath.</p>
 <p>Most Poison Cultivators applied poison on their weapons, some also used Hidden Weapons like Qing Shui did. With their decent speed and force, people naturally taught themselves about how to handle Hidden Weapons. But he had never seen anyone who used Hidden Weapons in such a tricky and sinister way like Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>It was natural for the old man of this age to have witnessed a lot of similar martial techniques. But the difference between those and the poison weapons that this young man had used were as different as the light of the firefly and the bright moon.</p>
 <p>He’d evade Qing Shui’s hidden weapons if he could. If he couldn’t, he’d deflect them with a weapon but would quickly pull back. Fortunately the things that his opponent shot out would lose some power after resisting a few times. But even so, this gave him a very bad headache because it made him feel as if he was unable to exert the strength in his body.</p>
 <p>The Earth Devouring Mice were also putting on their terrifying performance. With their extremely formidable endurance, absurd sped and their corroding bite, they were able to take away one Peak Martial Saint cultivator’s life. The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear served as a shield in the middle.</p>
 <p>The remaining four Peak Martial Saint cultivators were utterly tied down by the Fire Bird, Diamond Gigantic Elephant as well as Luan Luan’s ten Earth Devouring Mice and the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui breathed a sigh of relief. The odds of winning were already decided between him and the Baima Aristocrat Clan. He knew he must win, otherwise everything would be over for the Heavenly Palace and Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>After they pulled apart from each other once again, the elderly man looked at Qing Shui and brandished the gigantic sickle in his hands!</p>
 <p>Neighhhh!</p>
 <p>A loud and clear neigh of a horse rang out. Qing Shui’s pupils contracted as he stared at the mythical beast beside the elderly man. Its entire body was snow white and was about ten metres long. It had the exact appearance of a white horse that Qing Shui was familiar with, only that this white horse was fully covered with snow white scales and had a violet horn of about two metres long on its head.</p>
 <p>What was that? A pegasus? Or a unicorn?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was clueless about this creature. It had the strength of about one star, which was considerably powerful. What was the relationship between this creature and the Baima Aristocrat Clan? This was a white horse right......?</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was still clueless about this mythical beast of one star, that ‘white horse’ let out a clear and loud neigh. A faint glow appeared on the Baima Aristocrat Clan’s Old Ancestor as it gradually became apparent, enveloping the elderly man in its protection.</p>
 <p>Baima* Protection!</p>
 <p>[TL Note: Baima also means White Horse]</p>
 <p>“Die, brat!” The elderly man brandished the sickle in his hands as he once again rushed towards Qing Shui. Qing Shui abruptly shot out a 10,000 Years Frosted Iron Ball. On top of it, it was launched out with his full strength while he locked onto his opponent.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Out of Qing Shui’s expectation, the Baima Aristocrat Clan’s Old Ancestor actually made no efforts to dodge and he instead endured this attack. What made Qing Shui more surprised was that his attack was steadily resisted by the white glow on the elderly man’s body…...</p>
 <p>Sweat instantly formed on Qing Shui’s forehead. What could this be? An invincible state? Or was there a limit to that layer of protection? If this rendered his Hidden Weapons Techniques and poison ineffective, not only him but Luan Luan would also be in danger.</p>
 <p>For a moment Qing Shui was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. He was resisting his opponent’s attacks and trying to think up of something at the same time. If his opponent actually cast this protection, then he would definitely have a killing technique.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, let’s see if you have any more tricks up your sleeves today. No need to hold back.” The elderly man laughed maniacally as he once again dashed towards Qing Shui. The gigantic sickle in his hands swept towards Qing Shui leaving a trail of black flames.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui squinted and the field of his vision narrowed. At the abrupt wave of his right hand, a 10,000 Years Coldsteel Needle was violently shot outwards and flew towards the elderly man’s sickle.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wiped the trace of blood at the corner of his mouth but a smile broke across his face instead. It seemed like the halo on his opponent’s body was not invincible after all. It just had an extremely formidable resistance.</p>
 <p>The 10,000 Years Coldsteel Needle that was as fine as an ox hair from earlier had actually managed to penetrate an inch into the halo. It was a pity that it wasn’t able to make a contact with the opponent’s body. Nevertheless, this outcome had shocked the elderly man and also allowed Qing Shui to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>That needle pierce from just now had caused the halo to quiver slightly. This had let Qing Shui know that he still had some hope. If it was an invincible state, it’d really be over for him today.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s 10,000 Years Coldsteel Needles shot out continuously at different spots. He wanted to find out the weak spot. If he could smash it, then perhaps this layer of protection would collapse.</p>
 <p>Baima Qiufeng seemed to have also realized Qing Shui’s plan. His sickle movements quickened as he closed in aggressively. He wasn’t going to let Qing Shui have any opportunity.</p>
 <p>Seeing how the elderly man didn’t really seem to be in a hurry, Qing Shui knew that this protection should last for only a short time. He summoned the Thunderous Beast. Without realizing it, enough time had passed.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>As soon as Thunderous Beast was summoned, it dashed in the direction of Luan Luan. As soon as Luan Luan saw the Thunderous Beast, she knew that her chance was here. Another elderly man was killed by her Earth Devouring Mice with the help of Violet Lightning Strike.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t put away the Thunderous Beast for now this time. He had him continuously attack the remaining three Peak Martial Saint elderly men with its Thunderbolt.</p>
 <p>They weren’t able to evade the Thunderbolt. At first, they didn’t really feel anything. But then they gradually realized that not only their reflexes were getting slower but also their movements. Unfortunately by the time they had realized this, it was already too late.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Earth Devouring Mice also dashed towards the elderly man who had tried to escape by himself. With the great disparity between their speeds, the Earth Devouring Mice was like a group of terrifying devils to them.</p>
 <p>The old man watched heart achingly as the Baima Aristocrat Clan’s backbone died one by one with great sadness and sorrow. He turned his head around and locked on to Qing Shui. The gigantic black sickle in his hands gleamed with an odd silvery white as it hacked towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui clenched his jaws. The Big Dipper Sword in his hands suddenly vanished as a jet-black dagger of about a foot long manifested in its place.</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui neither evade nor ran as he let his opponent’s sickle land on his shoulder. He waited until it sank into his flesh before casting the Divinity Protection technique.</p>
 <p>The Baima Aristocrat Clan’s old man was also shocked because his attack was evadable. Yet he had no idea why this youth didn’t evade. Just when he was shocked, Qing Shui made his move.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the elderly man realized that his sickle actually didn’t split this brat in half but was instead deflected. He was alarmed as he shouted ‘damn‘ inwardly. Baima Qiufeng had quite a lot of faith in this Baima Protection. But he didn’t know why he was still extremely panicky right now. He simply couldn’t shake off the feeling that something terrible was going to happen this time.</p>
 <p>Poison Dragon Dagger!</p>
 <p>Extremely poisonous and extremely sharp!</p>
 <p>The Poison Dragon Dagger in his hand pierced quickly forward. On top of that, it was the Sword of Sixth Wave technique……</p>
 <p>The old man suddenly felt the Baima Protection waver as the waves of energy rushed forth towards him. In that moment, he clearly felt it - he was going to be finished.</p>
