 <p><strong>AST 1385 - Qing Shui was also capable of cultivating the Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack. Phoenix Form Phoenix Finger, Che Clan</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui wouldn’t be surprised at whatever power he provoked. In order to stand firmly in a continent’s city, he would need to stamp on some of the powerful forces in it. Or rather, establish himself with his medical expertise. But now, things weren’t going as well for Imperial Cuisine Hall, he had already captured the attention of some of the forces,</p>
 <p>If all went well, it was unlikely that Yelang Clan would try to challenge him once again.</p>
 <p>The Linghu Clan was a clan which he was able to get along quite well with. Even though he didn’t expect them to do anything for him, if anything was to happen, he could still seek them for some help.</p>
 <p>As for the Che Clan, Qing Shui was unaware of what kind of attitude he would get from Che Clan. Judging from the fact that they were able to become a Custodian within the Dancing Phoenix Organization, it could be seen that they were still quite a considerably strong clan. Logically speaking, there should be very powerful existences within Che Clan.</p>
 <p>However, the person whom he had a conflict with, was nothing but a wastrel from one of the branches of Che Clan. The only problem was that despite it being a branch family, it still had the title of Che Clan. Furthermore, Che Clan took care of the weak ones from their clan really dearly. Otherwise, the branch clans wouldn’t have dared to act so arrogantly.</p>
 <p>As for who got sick or injured, Qing Shui has expressed little concern for it. He was reluctant to treat people from this kind of clan and let alone back then, the Imperial Cuisine Hall already had such a rule. Hence, naturally, they wouldn’t try to break the rule for a mere branch of the Che Clan.</p>
 <p>Speaking of making exceptions, Qing Shui was certain that there would be times when he would make exceptions. Furthermore, there would be quite a lot of circumstances which would require him to do so. But one thing that was for sure was that he would definitely not do so for situations like today.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui had already completely mastered the Hundred Birds Worshipping The Phoenix. This technique didn’t require any grades. It was fine as long as he managed to use it proficiently. It would be perfect as long as he managed to unleash it instantaneously.</p>
 <p>Recently, Qing Shui was also trying to learn the Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack. Even though he wasn’t that talented in music, he still decided to give it a try upon seeing that it was a battle technique from Phoenix Form. But after a period of time, he started to notice that the pace at which he picked up the skills of Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack was not inferior to Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui got the chance to learn it, naturally, he wouldn’t want to abandon such a good battle technique. Even though it was a bit awkward for a man to play a zither, it didn’t really matter at all.</p>
 <p>The Five-string Zither and Seven-string Zither of Phoenix Form were both simple yet imposing. Everyone could be suited to play the tunes.</p>
 <p>With his legs crossed, Qing Shui was sitting in the middle of the air with the Five-string Zither floating horizontally in front of him. If he had done this in his previous incarnation, he would have been regarded by others as a magician or if not, a god. But when done here, it wasn’t really a feat to be surprised over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui squinted both of his eyes as he began to play various music notes with the Five-string Zither. As he did so, a chilly aura started spreading through the air. That was an ancient feeling. People who heard the melodies would sense a strong feeling of solitariness. It made people feel as if they had lived alone for thousands of years, rendering them no longer able to contain the loneliness within their heart.</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>A stirring noise rang. Like before, the aura being emitted around the area was still chilly. It was just that this was a kind of feeling of wealthiness. It was as if a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses had appeared across the sky. Sword Qi, as well as Origin Qi, were shuttling across the sky, destroying and snapping the victim’s limbs. It was as if the air was filled with smells of blood. The intense music notes replenished the people’s fighting spirit, it was as if their entire bodies had been filled with strength. It was a kind of aura capable of tearing the entire sky apart as well as sweeping off an entire army of a thousand people.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Without himself being aware of it, Qing Shui realized that he had taken a liking to Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack. It felt really majestic, so much so that at times, he was able to silently assassinate his opponents. And that was not all, Qing Shui had also noticed an important factor.</p>
 <p>The Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack shared a relationship with Spirit Energy. The stronger the Spirit Energy, the stronger his capability to exercise control over the attack. The effect would be even more significant if he could manage to achieve a state where their minds resonated with each other.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui had time on his hands, he once again reviewed the Phoenix Form. He was surprised to discover yet another new battle technique revealed.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked through it once. This was an unusual battle technique. It was used for melee combat. The primary use of Phoenix Finger was to destroy the blood vessels, meridians and acupoints in a person’s body. It was a technique which was specifically invented to counter against Demonic Beast Armor Manifestations and opponents either with powerful defense or were stronger than the user themselves.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt deeply stirred. He was really happy.</p>
 <p>The reason being that the Phoenix Finger required a very precise body motion. If the user was unable to engage in melee combat, the Phoenix Finger would be useless. However, Qing Shui had the Nine Palace Steps, he had significant advantage in terms of speed.</p>
 <p>Seeing that there was still time, Qing Shui begun to cultivate the Phoenix Finger and Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack. He realized that his speed of cultivating his own Nine Animals Mimicry Technique was very fast. This should be something to do with his Inheritance. Additionally, he had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal assisting him, which made it really easy for him to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Actually, Phoenix Finger only had six techniques. The first one was a normal heavy strike. This attack could cause damage worth a few times more than that of the user’s original strength to the opponent. Also, due to the enormous pressure exerted from the finger, its actual damage was even stronger than what was stated. The second one was striking the acupoints. Acupoints were scattered all across a human’s body. Each and every one of them had different functions. When one of the vital acupoints were hit, the damage of the Phoenix Finger would be multiplied. But similarly, experts also had their methods of protecting their acupoints. For example, true masters were able to shift the positions of their acupoints.</p>
 <p>The third one was striking the meridians. It could temporarily cut off the meridian’s across the victim’s body. Of course, with sufficient strength, the user might also be able to permanently cut off the victim’s meridians.</p>
 <p>The fourth one was striking the organs. The attack was specifically aimed towards the humans organs, internally damaging them.</p>
 <p>The fifth one was striking the blood vessels. It had the strength for lacerating, or even destroying the opponent’s blood veins.</p>
 <p>The sixth one was striking the opponent’s vital essence. It could destroy a part of the opponent’s vital essence. There was even a certain chance it could make the opponent collapse.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really happy upon seeing the abilities of Phoenix Finger. He should be able to master it quite quickly once he started cultivating it. Despite this, the technique itself was still really profound. It might seem like a simple single finger strike but when performed, one would know that it was actually more complex than they thought.</p>
 <p>Retrieving a pillow just as he had started yawning, this was how Qing Shui was feeling right now. Upon encountering a clan like Che Clan, even the Paragon Heavenly Technique would be useless against them. His resistance towards attacks on the other hand, was quite strong. The technique raised his defense by three times. His speed was already really terrifying to begin with. With the additional boost provided by Shadowless Paragon, it became even more formidable. The only thing he lacked was a powerful battle technique with fatal injuring power. Paragon Strike could only be used once. Now, with Phoenix Finger, by combining it with Nine Palace Step and Shadowless Paragon, they would definitely be a match made in heaven.</p>
 <p>Single Finger, Heavy Strike. The attack contained tremendous Divine Force. It was a simple yet significant ability. He must blend this ability into his own strength.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Qing Shui had already mastered it. This was the basic skill of Phoenix Finger. The reason being that the following finger techniques were all centred around this fundamental skill. Hence, Qing Shui spent a lot of time on this Single Finger.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui was barely able to use Second Finger, which struck the acupoints, time was already up. After brushing his teeth and changing into new clothes, he went out. It was yet another new day, would today be a peaceful day?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who had nothing to do upon coming out, taught the two girls his Phoenix Finger. Of course, he started off with the First Finger. He once again emphasized the importance of the body motions. Other than that, Qing Shui had a higher accomplishment in terms of his Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack compared to the two girls. He was able to investigate and research it with the two girls.</p>
 <p>Upon learning that, the two girls were dumbfounded. Back then, the two of them started to learn it earlier than Qing Shui. Originally, they thought that they would be ahead of Qing Shui but to their surprise, there was now already a huge gap between Qing Shui and themselves. Furthermore, they also learned that his wasn’t the strongest. Qing Shui’s daughter was able to play it even better than him.</p>
 <p>This had agitated the two girls a bit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that Phoenix Finger suited him really well. The reason being that his weapons were now already in possession of the Paragon in his Dantian. Not holding a weapon shared the same effect as him holding a weapon. This way, he could constantly change between his fists and fingers. He could draw out the same effect of the Thousand Hammer Technique with his fists.</p>
 <p>Linghu Clan joining the Imperial Cuisine Hall had caused a slight change to the situation. However, only one “Guest Card” was available to be handed out per day. Furthermore, it also had to be someone whom the Imperial Cuisine Hall recognized.</p>
 <p>Even though the ‘doorstep’ to Imperial Cuisine Hall was really high and a lot of people also accused them for favoring the rich and disdaining the poor. The free medical treatment which Imperial Cuisine Hall carried out once every ten days managed to shut these people’s mouths. As a matter of fact, Imperial Cuisine Hall had also stated specifically what kind of people they wouldn’t cure.</p>
 <p>On this day, news came. Che Chong from Che Clan had passed. Che Chong was the clan’s owner of one of the branch clans of Che Clan. He was also a powerful existence among the branch clans of Che Clan. Among all of the branch clans, Che Chong’s branch was undisputedly one of the top, which was also why Che Lang was able to stay so arrogant. It was also why he imperatively came to Qing Shui the other day.</p>
 <p>As long as Che Chong was around, this branch would have unlimited glory. Without him, there might still be no one who dared to bully Che Clan but despite this, they would fall significantly in their ranks. Maybe after more than ten or a hundred years, this branch of Che Clan would disappear entirely from Che Clan.</p>
 <p>Che Clan was an enormous clan. Despite this, not all of their branch clans could remain as branch clans forever. Over time, as their branches expanded with more generations, only those strong ones could remain as branch clans of Che Clan. The weaker ones would slowly break away from Che Clan. In fact, in every one of the Che Clan’s generations, there would be people from the main clan who would settle down and get married, forming a branch clan of their own. As far as that was concerned, some people from the branch clan might also end up getting married into the main clan. This was to ensure that Che Clan’s bloodline was being passed on. For the people who became a part of the main clan, some of them would hope to be the clan’s leader. All of the aristocratic clans were like this. This was a society where only the strong ones were respected. At the end of the day, this was also all just so that Che Clan’s bloodline could be passed on.</p>
 <p>Che Chong died. It had nothing to do with Qing Shui. Even if Che Clan was to seek trouble with him, they wouldn’t come during these few days. That Che Lang got beaten up by him to the extent he lost one tooth. If not mistaken, there should be people heading here to seek justice from him.</p>
 <p>The days went on one after another. In the blink of an eye, it had been three days. Qing Shui had also adapted himself to cultivating the first four fingers of the Phoenix Finger. If the time was to be converted, it would have been a year and a half. The two girls were improving at a really slow pace. But at the moment when they saw the prowess of the Phoenix Finger when Qing Shui unleashed it, they made up their mind to learn it. They also wanted to learn the Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At the moment when vibrating noises and noises of things breaking came through from downstairs, Qing Shui revealed a cold smile on his face. He immediately jumped down from top floor.</p>
 <p>As he thought, they had come. Judging from Che Clan’s temper, it was certain that they would show up.</p>
 <p>“Since you don’t cure diseases, what kind of physicians are you trying to be? Smash it! Kill whoever who tries to stop you,” a middle-aged man with white hair shouted loudly.</p>
 <p>“This place is only for curing patients. What right do you have to smash it?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s voice came through from the back.</p>
 <p>To his surprise, more than a hundred people came. As of now, the first floor had already been totally destroyed.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man turned around. He was quite a handsome man. He wore a light purple colored attire and he was quite noble. However, his eyebrows and his eyes were too sharp, which as a result, ruined his overall look.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui, he once again knitted his brows, “Are you accusing us, the people from Che Clan?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a sigh in his heart, “Would it kill you to stop mentioning the words Che Clan even once? Within the span of one breath of time, if they don’t stop, I will make sure they are unable to come out forever.”</p>
 <p>“Damned brat, you are indeed quite courageous. You actually dare to hurt the people from Che Clan, well then, you will have to prepare yourself for a battle against Che Clan.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt really funny about it. They were still unable to change their habit. It’s like he was really afraid that people wouldn’t know that he was a member of Che Clan and hence he found constantly emphasizing it something of utmost importance. It left Qing Shui to wonder if they would still continue to have the name Che Clan hanging around</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>A series of tragic screaming and colliding noises came through. The people who were inside Imperial Cuisine Hall were all getting blown out of the building with fresh blood spurting out of their mouth. Soon after, Yehuang Guwu and Yuan Su came out.</p>
