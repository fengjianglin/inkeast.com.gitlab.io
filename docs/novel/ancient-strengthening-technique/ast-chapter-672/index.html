 <p><strong>AST 672 - The dreadfulness of the Marrow Nibbling Worms</strong></p>
 <p>Qianxi Ye took out a completely red medicinal pill the size of a pigeon’s egg and swallowed it. His originally red eyes now looked even weirder and brighter, causing everyone's hearts to palpitate.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not detect any increase in strength of his opponent. When the opponent wielded the Evil Dragon Tooth and rushed over to score a kill, Qing Shui realized, that his speed had increased by a fold.</p>
 <p>“It actually has the same effect as the Gale Pellet……” Qing Shui was surprised.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, he wants to plant the Marrow Nibbling Worms.” Qing Shui’s complexion changed and he quickly threw the Frosted Iron Ball while attempting a desperate retreat.</p>
 <p>However, Qianxi Ye was much faster than Qing Shui and easily caught up with him. The Evil Dragon Tooth in his hands emitted a luminescent glow as it slashed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui felt an intense pain in his brain. It pierced all the way into his soul. Qing Shui instantly realized that he was finished.</p>
 <p>Gold Needles!</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui knew that he was done for, he could not let the man in front of him stay alive. His right hand turned transparent and he used the Gold Needles to stab where Qianxi Ye was injured earlier.</p>
 <p>Qimen Acupoint!</p>
 <p>Primordial flames!</p>
 <p>Godly Armor Shield!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>The Evil Dragon Tooth slashed apart the Violet Gold Divine Shield and landed on Qing Shui’s shoulder. Within the Lunar Silk Shirt, there was a moon-white glow, which was extremely dazzling. At the same time, a piercing sound of the bones in his shoulder breaking rang out.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>These were the primordial flames that Qing Shui never used for attacking before, they traveled via the Gold Needles and entered the target’s body causing tremendous damage. The flames directly caused the opponent’s organs to be burned, the position of the explosions caused the opponent’s heart to be almost ripped apart.</p>
 <p>The problem was that this required some time to pull off. The price, which Qing Shui paid, was receiving the attack of the Evil Dragon Tooth. Furthermore, Qing Shui had to be determined in his heart to die in order to execute this sure-kill strike.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Qianxi Ye howled miserably, then everything came to an end. He stared at Qing Shui in a stupefied manner before letting go of the huge Evil Dragon Tooth.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was covered in blood, there was a small hole in his forehead that was oozing out blood, causing Qing Shui’s entire face to turn incomparably demonic. The pain, that Qing Shui experienced in his brain, caused his thoughts to turn fuzzy, his body was on the verge of absolute collapse.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant instantly appeared at Qing Shui’s side. At this moment, the only remaining old man, who still struggled, threw out an object, that was like fireworks and shouted loudly.</p>
 <p>“Do it!”</p>
 <p>There was complete chaos below him, Qing Shui did his best to maintain some clarity, suddenly he felt someone hugging him. Qing Shui did his best to open both eyes and what he saw was a pretty face that was crying.</p>
 <p>Di Chen!</p>
 <p>On the other side, he saw Lady Duanmu, who was tearing up. That pure and dignified woman seemed so delicate at this moment. Qing Shui did his best to put on a smile, the battle in the distance had already concluded. The three strongest people of the Qianxi Clan, of the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, were dead.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, look at me, nothing can happen to you……” Di Chen called out to him as she hugged him, the tears on her face dripped onto Qing Shui’s face, washing away some blood.</p>
 <p>He was convulsing from the pain, blood continued to spill out, very soon, Di Chen’s clothes were dyed red but she did not even seem to notice.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui……”</p>
 <p>Di Qing was crying at the side, she was tugging at Qing Shui’s arm without restraint, as though she was trying to shake him awake. However, Qing Shui’s eyelids only got heavier and heavier.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, wake up, you promised to marry me, Qing Shui……” Di Chen hugged him tightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a bitter smile on his face, his vision seemed to get blurrier by the second. He used a Five Dragon Pellet earlier, thinking that regardless of the danger, it would allow him to survive another day. However, he realized that this effect was not absolute, the Five Dragon Pellet was ineffective.</p>
 <p>“Golden Buddha Aura Lotus!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s eyes lit up, he opened his eyes abruptly. This was his only chance at life, it was the holy medicine of legends that could revive a person from the dead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui resisted the intense pain and struggled for a while, his hands held an item that looked like a golden petal. Di Chen quickly received it and used her hands to quickly pinch out small pieces and feed them to Qing Shui piece by piece.</p>
 <p>A refreshing yet warm feeling flooded Qing Shui’s body, his injured shoulder and the wound on his forehead started to rapidly heal. However, Qing Shui resigned himself to fate just a moment later.</p>
 <p>The pain in his brain did not decrease, although his body was recovering, even if the brain was recovering, there was continuous damage being done to it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the root of the problem were the Marrow Nibbling Worms, they were not taken out yet, or else he would recover very fast. After all, he used a holy item, the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus. However, Qing Shui had no methods of extracting the Marrow Nibbling Worms from his brain.</p>
 <p>Although his wounds recovered momentarily, inevitably the symptoms came back. He was convulsing and his face was scarlet, it seemed as though his whole body was about to explode.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not scream in pain but everyone could see that Qing Shui was undergoing a tremendous torture.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan and Old Madam Mo also rushed over, the two of them looked at Qing Shui anxiously, especially Di Xuan. When Di Xuan saw Di Chen’s heartbroken appearance, he felt like a knife stabbed right through his heart.</p>
 <p>He felt that he let Di Chen down, even now, he wanted to die, he wanted to replace Qing Shui and be in his place, but he knew that he could not…...</p>
 <p>“Senior, Granny, go handle the other people from the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, they should have already started fighting down below.” While under the effects of the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, he could not die for now, but the pain from the Marrow Nibbling Worms made him wish for a swift death.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui……”</p>
 <p>“Go, nothing must happen to Uncle Jun and Old Nian. Chen`er, my dear, let’s go down and take a look as well!” Qing Shui endured the pain and told Di Xuan, Old Madam Mo, Di Chen, Lady Duanmu, and the rest.</p>
 <p>Sighing a few times, the few of them rushed downward. Di Chen was hugging Qing Shui, standing on the back of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Very soon, they reached the bottom, the fight had already broken out, the two camps were very distinct, the people of the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect were fully clad in black. However, amongst them, there were the people from the Sima Clan, Guan Clan, Du Clan, and Zuo Clan.</p>
 <p>Weng Weng…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned a large group of Jade Emperor Bees and that pair of Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies. Going against those experts, the Jade Emperor Bees were not of much help, but against these small fries, they were literally a killing machine.</p>
 <p>There were still a lot of people from the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, but those who remained were the inner disciples. Relatively speaking, there was a decrease of 90% or even less, they all had their own motives.</p>
 <p>The enemies were leaderless, in addition, the people of the Di Clan and their reinforcements had high morale. Qing Shui’s hundreds of Jade Emperor Bees, Diamond Gigantic Elephant, and peak Martial King Fire Bird joined the battle and it completely tipped in the Di Clan's favor. The only beast that Qing Shui did not summon was the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>This result was expected by everyone. After all, the most important experts were already dead. Those who were Grade 8 Martial Saints and above had mostly died in the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death, those that remained did not dare to show their faces and had already fled for their lives.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, how are you feeling?”</p>
 <p>When Yuan Su saw Qing Shui’s appearance, she was shocked and watched him anxiously, the expression on her face was that of horror and helplessness.</p>
 <p>Very soon, her expression dimmed.</p>
 <p>“You already know.” Qing Shui forced himself to smile.</p>
 <p>“I did not expect that you would be inflicted with the Marrow Nibbling Worms……” Yuan Su’s voice was very soft but it caused Di Chen and Di Qing, as well as Lady Duanmu, to tremble, they all knew of the dreadfulness of the Marrow Nibbling Worms.</p>
 <p>“Are you still in pain?” Yuan Su asked out of concern, hoping that Qing Shui was fine. To a certain degree, Qing Shui was her close friend because only Qing Shui could refine the Alchemy Recipes, that she made, perhaps even the problems of her meridians could only be solved by him.</p>
 <p>“It hurts, it hurts to the bones.” Actually, this was obvious just by looking at Qing Shui’s appearance, but after he said it, people understood that it was way more painful than it looked. Pain in the bones, that were the Marrow Nibbling Worms nibbling on his bones and marrows.</p>
 <p>“Eat this first, it is different from other medicinal pills, it completely numbs your body.” After Yuan SU thought for a while, she handed a medicinal pill to him.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui shook his head, “Pain means that I am still alive, I do not want to die oblivious to it.”</p>
 <p>“You won’t die, Qing Shui, you are a healer, tell me what can I do to treat you?” When Di Chen heard Qing Shui mention death, she could not stop trembling.</p>
 <p>Even Di Qing and Lady Duanmu stared blankly at Qing Shui, their face full of grief.</p>
 <p>Very soon, Di Xuan returned, Qing Shui asked Di Xuan and the others: “How did it go?”</p>
 <p>“The Ten Thousand Poisons Sect and Sima Clan have been dissolved, a portion was killed, the rest left.” Di Xuan looked at Qing Shui with worry, Qing Shui’s situation was the most important now.</p>
 <p>This result was quite normal, it was impossible to kill so many people. The main goal was to kill enough people for them to be unable to recover at least for the next 500 years, or even longer.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, how are you feeling now?”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>There were people who continuously came and asked this question with concern.</p>
 <p>“I won’t die, for now. I have means that can restrain them for a while. However, if this drags on, I will die. I hope to be able to resolve this during this period of time.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly, he knew that even with the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, there was no way to deal with this situation. It wasn't easy to remove the Marrow Nibbling Worms, this was the poison that the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect sect master sacrificed his life in order to inflict onto Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui's pain was gone, he did not know whether it was because the Marrow Nibbling Worms had eaten their fill or there were some other reasons. The Golden Buddha Aura Lotus already repaired all the damages, at least for now, Qing Shui recovered to his original state. As to when he would suffer from the attacks of the Marrow Nibbling Worms again, he did not know.</p>
 <p>The next time this happened, he could only eat the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus again and hope, that he could find a solution before he ran out of it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't expect the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus to save his life, the human life was full of drama. Now, Qing Shui could not be bothered to care about whether the Thunderous Beast could mature or not, it was way more important to stay alive.</p>
 <p>Di Chen was still hugging Qing Shui. When he temporarily felt better, she let go of him. Qing Shui stretched his hands to wipe her tears, but he found that his hands were covered in blood, thus he stopped mid-motion, that blood was from when his head was pierced.</p>
 <p>Di Chen grabbed Qing Shui’s hands and placed them on her face without any hesitation. Her face got stained with blood, there was a certain charm in this gesture.</p>
 <p>Soon, the battle was over and everything was swept clean. The Di Clan and the others had already started to deal with the territories of the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, Sima Clan, and the others.</p>
