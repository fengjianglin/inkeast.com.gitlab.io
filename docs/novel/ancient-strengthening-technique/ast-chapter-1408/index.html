 <p><strong>AST 1408 - Qing Sha’s Worry is Gone, Formidable Golden Fragrance Jade</strong></p>
 <p>The three elders had an indescribable expression. While they were in agony, they also seemed to be thinking about something.</p>
 <p>“Having you guys as a power in the Western Oxhe Continent is really unexpected. Unfortunately, some people were dragged down by their own lineage, but you guys are being dragged down by your own younger generations,” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>“I am sad not because I’m being dragged down by the younger generation, but because I’m watching the younger generation die one by one and I couldn’t do anything about it.” One of the elder sighed and said slowly.</p>
 <p>“Those two are the Watermoon Clan’s two daughters. The Watermoon Clan is so fortunate.” The other elder on the side said calmly.</p>
 <p>“Father’s greatest failure in life was judging people,” Qing Sha said coldly.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, this world does not have faithful people. Friends, siblings, fathers, and sons. Some parents would sacrifice one or two of their children for the good of their other children. Trade-offs are part of human nature and that’s it,” the elder sighed. They didn’t know what he was sighing for.</p>
 <p>Human nature was brittle, Qing Shui understood what the elder was saying. A volume of formidable battle technique or a piece of powerful divine weapon could be a clan’s downfall, causing the annihilation of the clan. However, Qing Shui did not long for battle techniques. If it was a person who thirsts for strength, a formidable battle technique scroll would be more important than his life. That person could do anything just to have that battle technique.</p>
 <p>“What’s done is done, you already expected that karma will come around one day.” Qing Sha stared at the elders with a death glare.</p>
 <p>“The day has come, so be it. Seems like the Waterwolf Clan made one big misstep. Although it seemed to be a good step, it has death hidden behind it. The variable factor was you, young man.” The elder looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned, what was this elder saying? Could it be that Qing Shui’s participation lead to their defeat? Or was he saying that the deciding factor was when Qing Sha encountered him? It was probably due to the fact that Qing Sha encountered Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Originally, we didn’t kill them because that child was not going to live long. Under normal circumstances, no one would be able to save her, thus we relaxed and did not chase her down. She had even injured her own face just to escape.”</p>
 <p>That was something that happened afterward. The matter with the Waterwolf Clan and Watermoon Clan had persisted for a long time.</p>
 <p>This elder had quite the ability, Qing Shui thought. “Now that things have reached this stage, there’s nothing more that I would like to talk about. Either you guys kill yourselves or I will end you.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe we will be able to escape, nothing is certain,” the elder said after thinking for a bit.</p>
 <p>“Then, why don’t you guys try seeing whether you can escape?”</p>
 <p>“The three of us have been researching a special technique. Allow us then to make a fool of ourselves.”</p>
 <p>They didn’t realize that Qing Shui had already cast the Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>Painting Ground as Prison!</p>
 <p>The elders’ expressions changed and suddenly their focus was on Qing Sha as they simultaneously pounced towards her.</p>
 <p>“Asking for death!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t think that the three elders would use such a method in their final moments. If they were not trying to hold Qing Sha hostage as a bargaining chip against Qing Shui, then they were going to kill Qing Sha. This thought angered Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s strength was horrifying. He swung his hand and all three elders were sent flying while they were spewing out blood. Soon, they were losing more air than they could take in.</p>
 <p>This was absolute strength. The three elders thought that Qing Shui was powerful, but they didn’t imagine that he would be this powerful. He had killed all three of them in one move. Although they were still alive, they would not last more than 15 minutes as their inner organs were completely crushed.</p>
 <p>The Sea Dragon Dynasty was over and the Waterwolf Clan was annihilated. Qing Sha felt a heavy burden leave her body. Just like a normal person with a hundred pounds lifted off her shoulders, she felt at ease now.</p>
 <p>A girl slowly walked towards Qing Sha’s side.</p>
 <p>“Xiao An!”</p>
 <p>“Older sister, we have avenged our parents!” Qing Sha hugged the other girl and cried.</p>
 <p>The sisters embraced each other while crying tears of happiness.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not worried what would become of the Sea Dragon Dynasty. Now that the Waterwolf Clan had fallen, another clan would immediately try to take over. Of course, it would be followed by another episode of bloodshed.</p>
 <p>A general’s success was built on the bodies of 10,000 people, let alone the changing of a dynasty.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui, Qing Sha, and the girl were on their way to return back. On the first day, Qing Shui treated the girl’s injuries while they rested. The girl was especially shocked. Though her injury was not completely healed, it was basically 60% healed. The girl knew how serious her injuries were, but she had never thought that it could be healed.</p>
 <p>The two sisters catch up with each other. Of course, they would have a lot to talk about.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, on the other hand, released his beasts and entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Cultivation, forging, cooking, refining medicine, smelting, and refining etc.… Qing Shui had many things to attend to. Even if he had arrived at the real Southern Sea, he did not have any free time to go fishing. He definitely need to go fishing at a later date.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Form did not produce any new formidable battle techniques, but Qing Shui was already satisfied. Phoenix Finger was already an existence that defied the natural order. In other words, to him, it was a divine existence in terms of battle techniques.</p>
 <p>After all, in terms of speed and steps technique, Qing Shui had the perfect technique that was compatible with Phoenix Finger, it was almost a match made in heaven.</p>
 <p>After he had completed Qing Sha’s wish, Qing Shui felt a lot more relaxed. He no longer had to remember this matter and Qing Sha could also live a happy life without burden.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Thank you for taking care of my younger sister these last couple years. We are also grateful to you for helping avenge us.”</p>
 <p>On the second day, the girl thanked Qing Shui directly.</p>
 <p>“However, you say it I’m still her foster father. You do not have to regard me as an outsider,” Qing Shui laughed while shaking his head.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. Stop being so courteous. Daddy, can you heal older sister’s scar?” Qing Sha said as she hoped that Qing Shui could do something.</p>
 <p>“Try this.” Qing Shui handed the girl one pellet of the Golden Fragrance Jade.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui forgot he had this while he was treating her. Luckily, she was not completely healed yet and was at most 60% recovered. Now, the Golden Fragrance Jade will become of use.</p>
 <p>The girl did not hesitate and directly consumed it. Afterwards, they could witness a scene that was out of this world.</p>
 <p>Before this, even when the girl was no longer as messy as she was before, even when her hair was no longer in a mess and she had already changed her clothes, she could not be considered to be someone beautiful, especially with the scar on her face. If one only look at her eyes, nose, and mouth, she looked very much like Qing Sha but her face was destroyed by the two large scars.</p>
 <p>However, once she consumed the Golden Fragrance Jade pellet, her face got a bit more flushed. The two horrifying scars slowly thinned out until only a light scar remained. After a couple days, it would probably completely disappear.</p>
 <p>There was no woman that didn’t want to be beautiful. The girl touched the disappearing scar on her face. Her face now was very elegant, and unlike Qing Sha, it did not contain any menacing aura.</p>
 <p>Sensing that she was almost fully recovered, the girl appeared like she was reborn.</p>
 <p>The girl was much older than Qing Sha, but was about the same age as Qing Shui. However, she did not know Qing Shui’s real age and only thought that he took good care of himself.</p>
 <p>That was because Qing Shui had said that the Golden Fragrance Jade could retain one’s beauty for at least 100 years.</p>
 <p>He helped them avenge their family, this meant that she could absolutely trust him. If Qing Shui asked her to do anything right now, she would not resist.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, I’ll send you to the Heaven Secrets Academy and you can assist Sunu!” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Where they would go was not an issue as long as she could be with her younger sister. They already had no home to begin with, so anywhere they went to was home.</p>
 <p>The return journey was quick. Qing Shui had the girls settled in the Heaven Secrets Academy. After he rested there for one day, he immediately used the Five Elements Divine Flag to leave.</p>
 <p>When he found out that Qing Sha’s family’s enemy was in Western Oxhe Continent, Qing Shui knew it would not be a difficult task to deal with. Moreover, he needed to allow Qing Sha to finish the business. The best he could do was to assist her a little bit. He had to allow her release her resentment.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Qing Sha’s strength was strong. All in all, everything went well and was fully completed.</p>
 <p>Returning to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, he had unknowingly taken a long while. At the same time, he had returned to Central Continent and brought two more Qing Clan members over.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui actually wanted to go out and have a look around.</p>
 <p>Once again, he was going to leave his family behind for an errand. This time, he stayed at the Imperial Cuisine Hall for no more than a week before he left again. Knowing that there were not many who would provoke him on the Dancing Phoenix Continent, his attitude was very clear. Moreover, his strength also played a key factor, those who dared were just asking for death.</p>
 <p>The place Qing Shui wanted to visit was a place that had always been in his mind, the</p>
 <p>Demon Lord Palace!</p>
 <p>Previously, in front of that woman, he would feel really ashamed. With what self-esteem he had, he did not want it to be wiped into nothingness again. So, he had worked very hard, hoping that one day he could openly visit her at the Demon Lord Palace.</p>
 <p>He did not care that people called her terrifying, nor did he care whether the Demon Lord Palace was part of the Four Great Evil Powers. These were not of importance. He wanted to find that woman and he believed in her. Even if it meant that he had to make enemies, he would still help her.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Qing Shui felt that she was not that type of person. There were rumors that there were people who wanted to taint her so they used the most pungent aphrodisiac on her. For the sake of her innocence, she had sealed herself. However, Qing Shui’s carelessness led to him undoing her seal, and then they had that incident.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know whether he had feelings for her, even though that thing had already happened, and especially since it was that type of thing. He would do his best to keep the women that he had done it with by his side unless she insisted on leaving him.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he had encountered her several times, even counting the times he had spiritual meetings with her. However, they had only exchanged a few words. It should be mentioned that before that, they didn’t talk with each other. This was already a progressed compared to those times.</p>
 <p>The region where the three continents intersected!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui already left the Dancing Phoenix Continent and had entered the vast wasteland. Though it was called a wasteland, there were quite a few people that resided here, even if it was dangerous.</p>
 <p>As for the Demon Lord Palace’s location, he knew the approximate direction. He had heard, without knowing whether it was accurate, that this region had quite a few evil powers. Of course, the Four Great Evil Powers were the strongest.</p>
 <p>Traveling into the wasteland area, he finally understood how boundless this area was. There were mountains, forests, rivers, and flatlands further than the eye could see. There were also some towns and villages, but they were all close by.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard that Demon Lord Palace resided on the Moyun Mountain. It was a large mountain range that was saturated with spirit Qi. It existed in the deep end where the three continents intersected.</p>
 <p>The Four Great Evil Powers were in very deep regions and their distance was far part. The four powers had battles with each other, and would also join forces with each other. However, it was not comprehensive. Usually, it was two of the powers that fought or joined forces. He had never heard of all four forces fighting or joining forces.</p>
 <p>Half a month already passed by. Qing Shui had used Nine Continents Steps countless of times, but most of the time he would be riding on the Hellfire Phoenix. He was scared of missing his destination. Only when he was in a vast swamp or inner sea did he use the Nine Continents Steps. Moreover, the distance was short when he tried to use it.</p>
 <p>Clank Clank….</p>
 <p>Suddenly, from the direction in front of him, battle music resounded. There was the sound of a Chinese zither mixed with sounds of a war drum. Listening to it made one’s blood boil.</p>
