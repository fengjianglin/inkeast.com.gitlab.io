  <p><strong>328 - Watching the Brilliant Fireworks with Her, A Picturesque Scenery!</strong></p>
  <p><span>But the Xiantian Alchemy Recipe that Qing Shui received from Cang Wuya was of another level. The success rate of the concoction was only one in one thousand, but the success rate in promoting to Xiantian was 100%. On top of that, it required a lot of Demonic Beast's Cores that made Qing Shui’s blood froze.</span></p>
  <p><span>The needed Demonic Beast’s Cores were of the ages of five hundred, one thousand, fifteen hundred, two thousand, twenty-five hundred, three thousand, thirty-five hundred and four thousand.</span></p>
  <p><span>In addition, two Thousand Year Snow Melted Woods, one Peach of Immortality, three drops of Five Thousand Years Turtle’s Blood, Thousand Year Ginseng, Thousand Year Lingzhi, Thyme, Thousand Year Fleeceflower Root, Thousand Year Blood Coral, Thousand Year Immortal Fox Saliva!</span></p>
  <p><span>After Qing Shui finished reading, he had a hunch that an average person wouldn’t be able to concoct this medicinal pill, the main challenge being the Demonic Beast’s Cores. The strength of a Five Hundred Year Beast was equivalent to a Xiantian Grade, Thousand Year was to a Xiantian Grade 10, Fifteen Hundred Year was to a Martial King Grade 1, Two Thousand Year was to a Martial King Grade 5, Twenty-Five Hundred Year was to a Martial King Grade 7, Three Thousand Year was to a Martial King Grade 8…...</span></p>
  <p><span>Yet, this wasn’t even the true measure of a beast’s strength. At least three humans were needed to be able to fight on par with one beast of equivalent level. To acquire the ingredients to concoct the Xiantian Golden Pellet would require the best martial cultivators in the Greencloud Continent, and this didn’t take the special beast groups of the Flying Beasts into consideration.</span></p>
  <p><span>Let alone that very minute one in one thousand success rate.</span></p>
  <p><span>Aside from Demonic Beast’s Core, Qing Shui already had Thousand Year Snow Melted Wood, Peach of Immortality and Thousand Year Immortal Fox Saliva with him.</span></p>
  <p><span>It was no wonder that Xiantian Golden Pellet was known as one of the heaven defying Medicinal Pills on the Continent, and on top of that, could let the person who ingested it to remain in the Xiantian realm forever. However, the success rate of concocting it was extremely low because after all, it was a miraculous medicinal pill that let anyone reach to the realm of Xiantian instantly.</span></p>
  <p><span>There were too many people in the world of the nine continents who couldn’t reach to Xiantian due to many different reasons. Perhaps some medicinal pills may be way stronger than Xiantian Golden Pellets, but almost all were dependent on the individual’s strength. Just like Qing Shui’s Beauty Pellets. If a Martial King grade cultivator ingested it, he would no doubt gain the strength equivalent to several people of the same grade. Yet, if an ordinary human were to ingest it, it wouldn’t yield much effect.</span></p>
  <p><span>The Xiantian Golden Pellet was said to be in defiance of the natural order because it allowed an ordinary human </span><span>to shed one's mortal body and exchange one's bones</span><span> to instantly reach the Xiantian realm. Not only their strength was increased tremendously, but they also gain priceless extra five hundred years of lifespan.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui remembered that his mother had ingested the “Crippling Divine Pill” before, so she would never reach the Xiantian realm her whole life. But he must concoct that Xiantian Golden Pellet, just for that extra five hundred years of lifespan.</span></p>
  <p><span>Currently Qing Shui felt that beasts of fifteen hundred years of age were all challenging, let alone the older beasts. But if conditions allowed, Qing Shui planned to concoct the Xiantian Golden Pellet within the span of five years. </span></p>
  <p><span>Today was the very last day of the year. The Heavenly Palace’s nine halls were already full of festive joy. The “Light Stones” were wrapped up colourfully and they bought a lot of firecrackers and fireworks.</span></p>
  <p><span>The sky had just turned dark, and the firecrackers were already exploding endlessly. Brilliant fireworks were rising up from every arena of the Heavenly Palace’s nine halls.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Qing Shui, the fireworks are so gorgeous!”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui was strolling among the crowds with Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li, looking at the dazzling fireworks that were rising continuously into the sky from time to time. Illuminated by the light of the dazzling fireworks, the beauty of the two ladies was as alluring as the plum blossoms.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Watch the brilliant fireworks with her, a picturesque scenery!”</span></p>
  <p><span>“Mingyue, Liu-Li, what are your wishes? We have a tradition that saying your wishes at the place where the fireworks are set off will come true,” he said with a smile as he daringly held the hands of the two ladies. The sky was completely dark by now, but beautifully illuminated by the dazzling fireworks.</span></p>
  <p><span>“What’s your wish? Say it first.” Huoyun Liu-Li looked up at Qing Shui, the smile in her eyes was intoxicating, as if they were filled with clear autumn waters!</span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui with a small smile hanging on her refined and elegant face. This was the first time she showed some interest in Qing Shui, or in his wish to be more precise.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Of course it is to go to the Yan Clan!” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Beside this, or what then after you return from the Yan Clan?” Canghai Mingyue asked gently.</span></p>
  <p><span>“After returning, my wish is to be able to marry the woman I love, have a few children and live a simple life,” Qing Shui answered after giving a serious thought about it.</span></p>
  <p><span>His answer shocked the two ladies. After all, if he continued to grow in this way, Qing Shui could become someone of importance at least somewhere. No one could even predict the heights he could achieve in the future. To think that his wish turned out to be something like this…...</span></p>
  <p><span>The two ladies looked at Qing Shui. They could feel his sincerity in those words! After thinking deeply about it, living with such a heavy burden, it was only natural that he would wish to live freely without being restrained as soon as the burden was lifted from his shoulders.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Why? Are you two looking down on my unambitious thinking?” Qing Shui smiled at the two ladies.</span></p>
  <p><span>“No, I am just surprised that your wish now, or after you return from the Yan Clan is something like this and not some other great ambition like doing some big business.” Canghai Mingyue gave him a knowing smile. Though her face was a little red.</span></p>
  <p><span>Thinking about the fact that Qing Shui would marry the woman he loves, have a few children and live a simple life made the two girls instantly blush a little. But they didn’t ask any further questions, such as who was the woman that Qing Shui loved?</span></p>
  <p><span>“Well, it’s your turn! Who’s going first? Your wish will definitely come true!” Qing Shui said and held the hands of the two ladies tightly.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Sister Mingyue, you go first!” Huoyun Liu-Li chuckled.</span></p>
  <p><span>Seeing that Huoyun Liu-Li didn’t say anything further, Canghai Mingyue smiled, “I wish to wipe out the “Heavy Sword Tower” in the 9th Level of the Sword Tower with my own power as soon as possible.”</span></p>
  <p><span>“But of course, this is just like my wish to go to the Yan Clan. This doesn’t count. Say another one,” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span>“That’s right! Hurry up, Sister. If you’re not going to say it, I will say it for you,” Huoyun Liu-Li mischievously teased her.</span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue’s face was suddenly tinted red. Qing Shui could clearly see the beautiful flush on her cheeks. It was a sight so alluring that it could make one’s jaw drop.</span></p>
  <p><span>“I wish that I could fall in love with you by the time my first wish was granted! I will try my best to fall in love with you, Qing Shui!” Canghai Mingyue looked at him with the look of determination on her beautiful face.</span></p>
  <p><span>“I shall wait for that day. If the day when you truly fall in love with me comes, I will make some babies with you. By then YueYue, you can really feed them milk…..”</span></p>
  <p><span>“Shut up!” Canghai Mingyue bashfully lowered her head and pouted.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui gripped her lily white hand tightly.</span></p>
  <p><span>“What about you, Liu-Li?” Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue asked Huoyun Liu-Li at almost the exact same time.</span></p>
  <p><span>Huoyun Liu-Li hesitated for awhile before looking at Canghai Mingyue shyly, “Sister, if you don’t mind… I wish to stay with Qing Shui together, too…..”</span></p>
  <p><span>She lowered her head, not daring to look at both Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui after she finished her sentence.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Silly girl, you’re so naive. Even if you are together with Qing Shui, if I really fall in love with him, you will definitely not be the only girl by his side,” Canghai Mingyue’s pitch black and deep beautiful orbs were filled with wisdom at this moment.</span></p>
  <p><span>“This woman really knows me well,” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled wryly at the two ladies.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Ah, he’s really this fickle in love?” Huoyun Liu-Li raised her head and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue smiled and asked, “Liu-Li, is that your wish? To be with Qing Shui?”</span></p>
  <p><span>“Yup!” Huoyun Liu-Li answered in a soft voice.</span></p>
  <p><span>“You wouldn’t mind the appearance of other women by his side in the future?” It was rare for Canghai Mingyue to be acting like this in front of Qing Shui, so at this moment, he really enjoyed watching her every move.</span></p>
  <p><span>“I do mind, but I just like him!” she replied softly.</span></p>
  <p><span>Huoyun Liu-Li became silent after her reply. Canghai Mingyue remained silent too after she heard her answer. Qing Shui felt a little awkward when the two ladies raised their heads and looked at him. Qing Shui didn’t even understand the true meaning of love.</span></p>
  <p><span>He had no idea what the girls around him now or then meant to him. He was completely clueless whether it was admiration or love he had for them.</span></p>
  <p><span>They said that love was a selfish thing. But Qing Shui realized that just like the girls standing before him, he didn’t know who he liked more or who he loved more. He didn’t even know if it was love in the first place.</span></p>
  <p><span>Shi QingZhuang, Mingyue GeLou, Zhu Qing… Similarly Qing Shui didn’t know who he loved, or if it was “possessiveness”. Could it be that he is really fickle in love after all, just like how Huoyun Liu-Li put it……?</span></p>
  <p><span>“If he is to marry, will he marry Shi QingZhuang, whom he is engaged to?” Qing Shui got a headache whenever he thought about this. Qing Shui’s heart calmed down when a stubborn silhouette at the Yan City appeared in his mind.</span></p>
  <p><span>He decided to stop thinking about it. The two ladies didn’t utter another word either. He raised his head and gazed at the endless fireworks that almost instantly faded away after they bloomed brilliantly in the sky.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Fireworks fade away so easily, just like beauty!” Qing Shui sighed in amazement once again!</span></p>
  <p><span>Wonderful things were often easy to lose. It was important for everyone to treasure everything before them, especially a person. As long as there were no complaints and regrets, the outcome was usually not that important.</span></p>
  <p><span>Much like what happened between Qing Shui and Shi QingZhuang. If he was given another chance to redo things, Qing Shui would still choose to possess her!</span></p>
  <p><span>After all, there would be times when one cradled the fruit of victory, covered in bruises and wounds only to realize that the thing that he fought so hard for was something that everyone was tossing as no one really wanted it all along. Sometimes life was just that dramatic.</span></p>
  <p><span>To live without any complaints or regrets, how many people could do that? Qing Shui watched as another brilliant firework rose into the sky. His heart told him to try his very best to live with less complaints and regrets and bring happiness to the people around him. And all this, would be enough.</span></p>

 <p><span>Qing Shui was strolling among the crowds with Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li, looking at the dazzling fireworks that were rising continuously into the sky from time to time. Illuminated by the light of the dazzling fireworks, the beauty of the two ladies was as alluring as the plum blossoms.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Watch the brilliant fireworks with her, a picturesque scenery!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mingyue, Liu-Li, what are your wishes? We have a tradition that saying your wishes at the place where the fireworks are set off will come true,” he said with a smile as he daringly held the hands of the two ladies. The sky was completely dark by now, but beautifully illuminated by the dazzling fireworks.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What’s your wish? Say it first.” Huoyun Liu-Li looked up at Qing Shui, the smile in her eyes was intoxicating, as if they were filled with clear autumn waters!</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui with a small smile hanging on her refined and elegant face. This was the first time she showed some interest in Qing Shui, or in his wish to be more precise.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Of course it is to go to the Yan Clan!” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Beside this, or what then after you return from the Yan Clan?” Canghai Mingyue asked gently.</span></p>
 <p><span>“After returning, my wish is to be able to marry the woman I love, have a few children and live a simple life,” Qing Shui answered after giving a serious thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span>His answer shocked the two ladies. After all, if he continued to grow in this way, Qing Shui could become someone of importance at least somewhere. No one could even predict the heights he could achieve in the future. To think that his wish turned out to be something like this…...</span></p>
 <p><span>The two ladies looked at Qing Shui. They could feel his sincerity in those words! After thinking deeply about it, living with such a heavy burden, it was only natural that he would wish to live freely without being restrained as soon as the burden was lifted from his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why? Are you two looking down on my unambitious thinking?” Qing Shui smiled at the two ladies.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No, I am just surprised that your wish now, or after you return from the Yan Clan is something like this and not some other great ambition like doing some big business.” Canghai Mingyue gave him a knowing smile. Though her face was a little red.</span></p>
 <p><span>Thinking about the fact that Qing Shui would marry the woman he loves, have a few children and live a simple life made the two girls instantly blush a little. But they didn’t ask any further questions, such as who was the woman that Qing Shui loved?</span></p>
 <p><span>“Well, it’s your turn! Who’s going first? Your wish will definitely come true!” Qing Shui said and held the hands of the two ladies tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sister Mingyue, you go first!” Huoyun Liu-Li chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing that Huoyun Liu-Li didn’t say anything further, Canghai Mingyue smiled, “I wish to wipe out the “Heavy Sword Tower” in the 9th Level of the Sword Tower with my own power as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“But of course, this is just like my wish to go to the Yan Clan. This doesn’t count. Say another one,” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right! Hurry up, Sister. If you’re not going to say it, I will say it for you,” Huoyun Liu-Li mischievously teased her.</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue’s face was suddenly tinted red. Qing Shui could clearly see the beautiful flush on her cheeks. It was a sight so alluring that it could make one’s jaw drop.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I wish that I could fall in love with you by the time my first wish was granted! I will try my best to fall in love with you, Qing Shui!” Canghai Mingyue looked at him with the look of determination on her beautiful face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I shall wait for that day. If the day when you truly fall in love with me comes, I will make some babies with you. By then YueYue, you can really feed them milk…..”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shut up!” Canghai Mingyue bashfully lowered her head and pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui gripped her lily white hand tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What about you, Liu-Li?” Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue asked Huoyun Liu-Li at almost the exact same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huoyun Liu-Li hesitated for awhile before looking at Canghai Mingyue shyly, “Sister, if you don’t mind… I wish to stay with Qing Shui together, too…..”</span></p>
 <p><span>She lowered her head, not daring to look at both Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui after she finished her sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Silly girl, you’re so naive. Even if you are together with Qing Shui, if I really fall in love with him, you will definitely not be the only girl by his side,” Canghai Mingyue’s pitch black and deep beautiful orbs were filled with wisdom at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This woman really knows me well,” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled wryly at the two ladies.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ah, he’s really this fickle in love?” Huoyun Liu-Li raised her head and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue smiled and asked, “Liu-Li, is that your wish? To be with Qing Shui?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yup!” Huoyun Liu-Li answered in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You wouldn’t mind the appearance of other women by his side in the future?” It was rare for Canghai Mingyue to be acting like this in front of Qing Shui, so at this moment, he really enjoyed watching her every move.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I do mind, but I just like him!” she replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huoyun Liu-Li became silent after her reply. Canghai Mingyue remained silent too after she heard her answer. Qing Shui felt a little awkward when the two ladies raised their heads and looked at him. Qing Shui didn’t even understand the true meaning of love.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had no idea what the girls around him now or then meant to him. He was completely clueless whether it was admiration or love he had for them.</span></p>
 <p><span>They said that love was a selfish thing. But Qing Shui realized that just like the girls standing before him, he didn’t know who he liked more or who he loved more. He didn’t even know if it was love in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi QingZhuang, Mingyue GeLou, Zhu Qing… Similarly Qing Shui didn’t know who he loved, or if it was “possessiveness”. Could it be that he is really fickle in love after all, just like how Huoyun Liu-Li put it……?</span></p>
 <p><span>“If he is to marry, will he marry Shi QingZhuang, whom he is engaged to?” Qing Shui got a headache whenever he thought about this. Qing Shui’s heart calmed down when a stubborn silhouette at the Yan City appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>He decided to stop thinking about it. The two ladies didn’t utter another word either. He raised his head and gazed at the endless fireworks that almost instantly faded away after they bloomed brilliantly in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Fireworks fade away so easily, just like beauty!” Qing Shui sighed in amazement once again!</span></p>
 <p><span>Wonderful things were often easy to lose. It was important for everyone to treasure everything before them, especially a person. As long as there were no complaints and regrets, the outcome was usually not that important.</span></p>
 <p><span>Much like what happened between Qing Shui and Shi QingZhuang. If he was given another chance to redo things, Qing Shui would still choose to possess her!</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, there would be times when one cradled the fruit of victory, covered in bruises and wounds only to realize that the thing that he fought so hard for was something that everyone was tossing as no one really wanted it all along. Sometimes life was just that dramatic.</span></p>
 <p><span>To live without any complaints or regrets, how many people could do that? Qing Shui watched as another brilliant firework rose into the sky. His heart told him to try his very best to live with less complaints and regrets and bring happiness to the people around him. And all this, would be enough.</span></p>
