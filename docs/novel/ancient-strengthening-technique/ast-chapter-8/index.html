 <p><strong>Chapter 8 Divine Strength.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><b>Ancient Strengthening Technique: Chapter 8 – Divine Strength</b></p>
  <p><span style>Starting from the second day, Qing Shui joined the 3rd generation clan members in their daily training sessions. This had always been Qing Shui’s dream. Countless times in the past, as he passed by the practice yard, he had no choice but to look at them from afar as the 3rd generation members strengthened themselves, intensely practicing their martial techniques with vigor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now that he had recovered, the first decision he made was to cultivate. The second decision was to join the Qing Clan’s daily training session. The elder in charge of supervising the daily training was named Qing Hai, he was the 4th son of Qing Luo and the father of his best friend, Qing Hu.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cultivation of the Blue Lotus Art, only counted when the practitioner reached the realm of Martial Warrior, Martial General and Martial Commander. Each realm was further divided into 10 grades. As a result, the Qing Clan had a total of 3 versions for practising in the Blue Lotus Art. These 3 versions are, low-tier, mid-tier, and top-tier.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As for practitioners at the Martial Student stage, there was no need to segregate them into 10 grades. As long as one cultivates, he could be considered to be at the Martial Student level. After a practitioner at the Martial Student level cultivates for a minimum of 3 years, forming Qi, he could be considered a Martial Warrior, albeit one of the lowest grade – Martial Warrior, Grade 1.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After condensing that single strand of Qi, Qing Shui would naturally be considered as having reached Martial Warrior, Grade 1. He was considered one of the weakest amongst &nbsp;the members from the 3rd generation, yet strangely enough, he was the happiest and most confident one amongst all of them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, congratulations on finally achieving your wish!” Qing Hu smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui nodded. Today was the first day where he officially entered the Qing Clan’s practice yard. At this moment, Qing Shui slowly surveyed the humble looking practice yard. The enormous floor tiles were made out of pieces of blue stones, and the roof was shaped similar to a pavilion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Those practising here are all cultivators, be it rain or shine they would never shy away from their purpose. Their top priority would always remain deep inside their hearts, cultivating regardless of anything else!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cultivation of the Blue Lotus Art would always be done in one’s basement. No matter which generation you were in, as long as you cultivated, you would be given your own basement. The practice yard was used for the purpose of increasing one’s strength, improving one’s martial art stances and one’s hand-to-hand combat skills.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a custom of the Qing Clan to only allow their younger members to practice martial art techniques after they had built up their basic foundation and internal strength. No matter how impressive a technique is, it would only be able to fully display its might with the support of one’s internal energy. Without first building up one’s foundation, practicing martial art techniques would only lead to more harm than good.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the practice yard, the younger members were practicing the strongest, low-tier foundation building art as well as simple fist techniques, helping them train the coordination, movement, and flexibility of their bodies.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Normally, one would only be allowed to practice martial techniques when one had cultivated the Blue Lotus Art up to Martial Warrior, 6th Grade!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Currently amongst the Qing Clan’s 3rd generation members, only Qing Zi and Qing You had the qualifications to practice martial techniques. The rest did not have permission to do so yet. The 3rd generation members were all eagerly anticipating the day when they would finally have the ability to do so. Moreover, they could not wait for the day they would reach the the first Lotus Manifestation stage, only obtainable at the Martial Commander, 7th Grade. Once one’s protective lotus manifested, one could both attack or defend with it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the Qing Clan, once your strength had broken through to Martial Warrior, 6th Grade, you would no longer be required to join in on the daily training session. Therefore, Qing Shui did not see the eldest grandson Qing You, nor the widely acclaimed top genius of the Qing Clan, Qing Zi!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked on as Qing Hu was currently lifting a huge looking rock, the rock looked to be roughly about 200 Jin[1]. Qing Shui initially wanted to go and give it a try, but in hindsight, after considering that Qing Hu, who was at the 3rd grade of the Blue Lotus Art seemingly have slight trouble lifting it, he discarded that notion. He did not want to cause a ruckus by succeeding when he was clearly only at the first stage of the Blue Lotus Art.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After all, Qing Shui had the temperament of an adult. He was not afraid of losing face, not to mention that he had never considered himself to be the same level as these brats.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the young age of 8, if he could even lift up a 20 jin rock, it would already be deemed as a miracle in his previous world.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked around and decided to test his strength by &nbsp;challenging a 50 jin rock. Although he had a small frame, with the strength granted to him by the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he could exert a level of energy that’s higher than most people.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui placed his hands around the rock, utilizing all the strength he was capable of and tried to lift it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After which, bursts of laughter rang aloud in the practice yard.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was because, Qing Shui appeared to have fallen down as he had overestimated his strength by trying to lift that heavy rock.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, deep within his heart, Qing Shui was extremely elated. Qing Shui could feel that when he tried to lift the 50 jin rock, he was unable to feel the weight of it, which resulted in him overusing his strength and thus losing his balance!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The other children thought that Qing Shui was unable to lift the 50 jin &nbsp;rock and fell down because of that.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are you all laughing at? Carry on with what you were doing.” A voice belonging to a valiant looking youth about 14-15 years old, growled menacingly. Qing Hu was unhappy about the contemptible glances the others threw at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Hu hurriedly went to the side of Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you alright Qing Shui? Maybe it would be better if we start with something smaller?” Qing Hu said with a worried look in his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was very contented, as he could feel the sincerity of Qing Hu. As for the mocking laughter that echoed out earlier, it was as if Qing Shui did not care about it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I am alright, thank you Qing Hu.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, a youth with a heroic bearing walked over.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, are you alright? You should first warm up your body by jogging, practice our elementary fist techniques and stretch your body before challenging that 50 jin rock.” The youth instructed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Okay I got it, thank you for the pointers”. Qing Shui replied with a smile. Qing Shui knew that the youth’s name was Qing Yang. Amongst the 3rd generation clan members, he was the strongest after Qing Zi and Qing You. His cultivation level had already broken through to the peak of Martial Warrior, 5th Grade! In the past, he had never ridiculed Qing Shui and even helped him sometimes. Therefore Qing Shui held quite a favorable view of him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Yang also smiled warmly, shortly after he left while reminding Qing Shui to be more careful.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the practice yard, the number of the young members from the Qing Clan, including Qing Shui, totaled 16. On average, the population of the Qing Clan tilted more heavily towards the male side. Other than Qing Hu’s family, whom had produced a female baby, the other households had all produced an average of 4 male babies.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Hu’s sister was named Qing Bei, Other than being the only female in the 3rd generation, she was also the youngest.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui gege [1], you must take care of yourself. If not Aunt Yi will become worried for you again..” Qing Bei opened her eyes wide in an attempt to convey the seriousness of the situation as she spoke in a concerned tone with a hint of childishness in it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the cutesy little girl in front of him seriously nodding her head, Qing Shui almost forgot that he was only 8 years old himself, and could easily pass off as a cutesy little boy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>———</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the first attempt of lifting ended in failure, Qing Shui tried again for a second time. Adjusting his level of strength he slowly lifted the 50 jin rock up. Success! He felt that, for him, the weight of the 50 jin rock could only be classified as feather light.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After that he moved on to 80 jin, then 100 jin, 180 jin………</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, Qing Shui had already arrived at the place where the 200 jin rocks were located. All of the Qing Clan’s 3rd generation member, including Qin Yang was staring at Qing Shui with expressions of awe. If Qing Hai had not already departed from the practice yard, he too would have become astounded.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As Qing Shui attempted to lift the 200 jin rock, it appeared that he had to exerted a lot of energy to do so. Success! His success was met with shocked gazes and absolute silence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was exultant in his heart, because when he was lifting the 180 jin rock, he almost stumbled as he was not strong enough. However, at that moment, the yellow strand of Qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique, automatically circulated without intention. Qing Shui could feel boundless waves of energy flowing into him, thus easily lifting that 180 jin rock.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he was lifting the 200 jin rock, he did not want to recklessly cause a ruckus and cause the spectators think of him as a monster, or he would have trouble explaining his level of strength. As a result, he deceptively appeared to use a great amount of strength before lifting the 200 jin rock.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, Wow! I really could not tell that you had such strength within your deceptively thin body. When I lifted the 200 jin heavy rock, I had to &nbsp;use the Blue Lotus Art to aid me. However… you were able to lift it up with only your body strength.” Qing Hu exclaimed in admiration, without any hints of jealousy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled shyly and said “This is already my limit.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As the training session came to an end, everyone slowly departed. Initially, Qing Hu wanted to leave with Qing Shui, but Qing Shui rejected him saying that he still wanted to train more.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shui was finally alone in the practice yard, he went directly to the largest rock in the 3rd generation disciples section. This rock weighs about 800 jin, only those who are at the peak of Martial Warrior, 5th Grade would be able to lift it…</span></p>

 <p><span style>Qing Shui placed his hands around the rock, utilizing all the strength he was capable of and tried to lift it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After which, bursts of laughter rang aloud in the practice yard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because, Qing Shui appeared to have fallen down as he had overestimated his strength by trying to lift that heavy rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, deep within his heart, Qing Shui was extremely elated. Qing Shui could feel that when he tried to lift the 50 jin rock, he was unable to feel the weight of it, which resulted in him overusing his strength and thus losing his balance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other children thought that Qing Shui was unable to lift the 50 jin &nbsp;rock and fell down because of that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you all laughing at? Carry on with what you were doing.” A voice belonging to a valiant looking youth about 14-15 years old, growled menacingly. Qing Hu was unhappy about the contemptible glances the others threw at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Hu hurriedly went to the side of Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you alright Qing Shui? Maybe it would be better if we start with something smaller?” Qing Hu said with a worried look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was very contented, as he could feel the sincerity of Qing Hu. As for the mocking laughter that echoed out earlier, it was as if Qing Shui did not care about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am alright, thank you Qing Hu.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a youth with a heroic bearing walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, are you alright? You should first warm up your body by jogging, practice our elementary fist techniques and stretch your body before challenging that 50 jin rock.” The youth instructed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay I got it, thank you for the pointers”. Qing Shui replied with a smile. Qing Shui knew that the youth’s name was Qing Yang. Amongst the 3rd generation clan members, he was the strongest after Qing Zi and Qing You. His cultivation level had already broken through to the peak of Martial Warrior, 5th Grade! In the past, he had never ridiculed Qing Shui and even helped him sometimes. Therefore Qing Shui held quite a favorable view of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yang also smiled warmly, shortly after he left while reminding Qing Shui to be more careful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the practice yard, the number of the young members from the Qing Clan, including Qing Shui, totaled 16. On average, the population of the Qing Clan tilted more heavily towards the male side. Other than Qing Hu’s family, whom had produced a female baby, the other households had all produced an average of 4 male babies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Hu’s sister was named Qing Bei, Other than being the only female in the 3rd generation, she was also the youngest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui gege [1], you must take care of yourself. If not Aunt Yi will become worried for you again..” Qing Bei opened her eyes wide in an attempt to convey the seriousness of the situation as she spoke in a concerned tone with a hint of childishness in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the cutesy little girl in front of him seriously nodding her head, Qing Shui almost forgot that he was only 8 years old himself, and could easily pass off as a cutesy little boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>———</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the first attempt of lifting ended in failure, Qing Shui tried again for a second time. Adjusting his level of strength he slowly lifted the 50 jin rock up. Success! He felt that, for him, the weight of the 50 jin rock could only be classified as feather light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that he moved on to 80 jin, then 100 jin, 180 jin………</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, Qing Shui had already arrived at the place where the 200 jin rocks were located. All of the Qing Clan’s 3rd generation member, including Qin Yang was staring at Qing Shui with expressions of awe. If Qing Hai had not already departed from the practice yard, he too would have become astounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Qing Shui attempted to lift the 200 jin rock, it appeared that he had to exerted a lot of energy to do so. Success! His success was met with shocked gazes and absolute silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was exultant in his heart, because when he was lifting the 180 jin rock, he almost stumbled as he was not strong enough. However, at that moment, the yellow strand of Qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique, automatically circulated without intention. Qing Shui could feel boundless waves of energy flowing into him, thus easily lifting that 180 jin rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was lifting the 200 jin rock, he did not want to recklessly cause a ruckus and cause the spectators think of him as a monster, or he would have trouble explaining his level of strength. As a result, he deceptively appeared to use a great amount of strength before lifting the 200 jin rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, Wow! I really could not tell that you had such strength within your deceptively thin body. When I lifted the 200 jin heavy rock, I had to &nbsp;use the Blue Lotus Art to aid me. However… you were able to lift it up with only your body strength.” Qing Hu exclaimed in admiration, without any hints of jealousy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled shyly and said “This is already my limit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the training session came to an end, everyone slowly departed. Initially, Qing Hu wanted to leave with Qing Shui, but Qing Shui rejected him saying that he still wanted to train more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Shui was finally alone in the practice yard, he went directly to the largest rock in the 3rd generation disciples section. This rock weighs about 800 jin, only those who are at the peak of Martial Warrior, 5th Grade would be able to lift it…</span></p>
