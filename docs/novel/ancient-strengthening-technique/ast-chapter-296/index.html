  <p><strong>AST 296 - Why Would I Hate You, Blue Lotus Art, The Appearance of Lotus Flowers</strong></p>
  <p><span style>"Your Uncle Zhongyue is that lady's father?" Qing Shui deliberately asked, wanting to rid Yan Ling`er of the little bit of her wariness. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"Mmm mmm, it's a pity that he died when Sister Qingqing was ten years old!" Yan Ling`er said sympathetically. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"That lady has been selling tea leaves in the streets since she was ten years old?</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Did no one in the Yan Clan care?</span></p>
  <p><span style>"What about her mother?</span></p>
  <p><span style>"What about her grandfather?" Qing Shui asked, puzzled. Qing Shui felt that this was a sly move towards Yan Ling`er, but it was the faster way he could get to understand more about the Yan Clan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Grandfather hasn't been interfering in the Yan Clan's matters for many years. It was said that Sister Qingqing's mother is at a faraway place. The reason Sister Qingqing has been hanging so strongly for so long is because she trusts that her mother will come back for her."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Saying this, Yan Ling`er herself broke out in tears!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could sense that Yan Ling`er was truly kindhearted, and it seemed that she had a very close relationship with his "elder sister".</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stood there, not moving. He was waiting. The Qing Shui now really could not help but want to head off towards Yan City immediately, but his rationale made him suppress this thought.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Not long after Uncle Zhongyue passed away, Madam Xiao, no, that woman from the Xiao Clan gained power very quickly, gaining control of the Yan Clan partially. But that lady was still not satisfied with this, and relying on the support she received from the Xiao Clan, she tried to seduce my eldest uncle. In reality, the Xiao Clan is basically in the control of my eldest uncle and this woman from the Xiao Clan."</span></p>
  <p><span style>It may be because Yan Ling`er was infuriated, and could not help but wish that these savageous and cruel people could die earlier, Qing Shui finally saw it for himself that there was no kinship in reputable clans, such that it was possible even "he" had died in the hands of that woman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"The Yan Clan's clan head doesn’t care about this?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Yan Clan should have plenty of experts who are loyal to the clan. Are they all just letting a woman putting the Yan Clan through all this while they do nothing at all?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui realized that things were not as simple as he had thought. Previously, he was prepared to head to the Yan Clan right after he had stepped into Xiantian. Thinking about it made him feel how childish his thought was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now, he realized that the Yan Clan had an invisible thread connected to it and was very, very far away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Grandfather had handed the Yan Clan to my eldest uncle, and would not step out unless there are any major issues. There are some experts in the Yan Clan, but it's strange how they all seemed to have qualms about a certain person," Yan Ling`er said, puzzled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Who?</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Isn't Yan Clan the strongest clan in the Yan Country?" Qing Shui felt that this person was certain the crux of everything.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was nothing but curiously from Qing Shui's tone. He knew that Yan Ling`er was simple-minded, but at least she was not stupid.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Xiao Clan's clan head, Xiao Shishui. Rumor has it that he is an important character in a certain sect, and that sect is not one which a country could afford to offend," Yan Ling`er said worriedly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Why did your Sister Qingqing came out to sell tea leaves? How did a Young Miss from the Yan Clan fell into such dire straits?" Qing Shui realized that till now, he had yet to understand this, so he asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Four years ago, when Sister Qingqing was sixteen years old, the Xiao Clan's Eldest Young Master Xiao had wanted to take Sister Qingqing as his concubine, and Madam Xiao had actually agreed on her behalf. After all, she was already considered half a clan head then. But Sister Qingqing put up strong resistance, and just because of this, that Eldest Young Master Xiao got kicked by Sister Qingqing, at his critical part..."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that she must have kicked the man's important part, but he knew that that Eldest Young Master Xiao was fine, since he had seen him when he first came to Greencloud Continent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"What happened thereafter?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>"After that, Sister Qingqing was chased out by Madam Xiao, who claimed to want to let her experience life like that of a beggar, to let her know how precious a life she had been living in the past, enjoying all the good clothing and good food. They had hoped that this would make Sister Qingqing change her mind, but they did not expect Sister Qingqing to have persisted for four years since then, not giving in no matter how hard life was."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui suddenly thought of the person called Guo Polu. While Qing Shui had not seen him before, he could never forget his name. It was because the lass his mother had been thinking of was indebted to him. Qing Shui would not forget the Yan Clan and the Xiao Clan either, since they were clans that he had set his mind on eliminating.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"You are a kindhearted girl. I hope that when the day comes, you'll not hate me!" Qing Shui said and smiled lightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Seeing Qing Shui's warming smile, she said, "Brother Qing Shui, that won't happen. Why would I hate you?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui bade Yan Ling`er goodbye, and could not hold back his sigh. This girl did not simply just want to get closer to him. The other time, that lady Xi Yue had said some strange things.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"One day, you'll cry. Go on and hate me, this was an encounter that should never have happened. It'll only make you feel worse." Qing Shui shook his head, entered the bedroom, and immediately entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Recalling Yan Ling`er's words, he thought of how that "elder sister" had no one but herself to rely on. Qing Shui had initially thought that Yan Zhongyue would be good to her, since he had loved his mother, and would definitely treat their daughter well. Well, it seemed that he had done so, but it was a pity that he had died. Thinking about this, Qing Shui had the sudden urge to cry. He did not know why he felt this way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It may be because he hated him, and had nowhere to vent his hatred...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cultivation. He could only attempt to forget by focusing his mind on his cultivation. These things weighed down Qing Shui's heart as if they were a few big blocks of mountains, making it hard for him to breathe.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Ancient Strengthening Technique circulated gradually. Suddenly, Qing Shui thought of his &lt;&lt;Blue Lotus Art&gt;&gt;, the &lt;&lt;Blue Lotus Art&gt;&gt; which he had abandoned.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Ever since he broke through to the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui had abandoned the Blue Lotus Art which he had trained to the 4th level. At that time, Qing Shui who had stepped into Xiantian felt that the biggest advantage of the Blue Lotus Art was to act as an aid to allow him to cultivate the Ancient Strengthening Technique successfully. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Thinking about it, Qing Shui realized that there were many things which could achieve an unbelievable effect at certain timings. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to continue his cultivation for the Blue Lotus Art. He looked forward to attaining the stage where he would be encompassed by nine lotus flowers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although he had not been cultivating this technique, Qing Shui did not lose his touch. After all, back then he practised the first four levels of the Blue Lotus Art an endless number of times.</span></p>
  <p><span style>But he did not know why after he had reached a breakthrough with his Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui realized that his Blue Lotus Art was at the lowest level amongst those of his age in the Qing Clan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique which was much stronger than the Blue Lotus Art gradually started to circulate, flowing through the meridian channels. Qing Shui circulated his Qi according the the Blue Lotus Art, but gradually added in the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. This was not something strange, since he had previously trained the two together before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>But this time around, Qing Shui felt that something was very different, although he could not really pinpoint it. He just felt that previously, there were many parts which did not seem smooth, but now everything was flowing smoothly without any resistance at all. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The feeling was akin to that of eating ice cream in the scorching summer, all 3,600,000 of his pores were cleared. However, Qing Shui did not feel surprised, but felt that this was how it should have been. </span></p>
  <p><span style>In the past, whenever he achieved a breakthrough in his Ancient Strengthening Technique, his Blue Lotus Art would also gain a breakthrough of a similar level. This time around, Qing Shui felt that even if there was no breakthrough, he would at least be able to reach the pinnacle of the 4th level. Back then, Qing Shui had abandoned the Blue Lotus Art just after reaching the 4th level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This time around, Qing Shui's practice went very smoothly, and he even felt as if everything was going out of hand, so much so that he was fully intoxicated in the feeling. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was as if he had forgotten about the passing time, not expecting that he would be able to enter the ‘</span><span style>state of no concious’</span><span style> even when he was just practising the Blue Lotus Art. Most importantly, he had entered it unknowingly. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Time passed by slowly, and suddenly, he stood up with his eyes closed, his hands pushed forth while forming a hand sign in the shape of a lotus, not creating a sound. </span></p>
  <p><span style>After pushing forth a hand sign, Qing Shui abruptly opened his eyes. A golden colored lotus flower the size of a basin appeared before him. </span></p>
  <p><span style>It was a nine-petaled lotus flower!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at the translucent sparkly golden colored lotus flower which was beside him, beautiful as if it was just an illusion, exuding a strong aura. Qing Shui gradually reached out his hand towards it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui reached out his hands very slowly, afraid that it would disappear once he touched it!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui noticed that there was a faint connection between him and the lotus, and it was just then when his hand touched the golden colored lotus flower.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"It’s material... and hard!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although he had suspected it, he was still astonished. After all, it looked translucent!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui used that weak connection to slowly control the lotus, and discovered that it could actually be moved about with flexibility. It was just that he needed to exhaust the Dan Tian's "</span><span style>Divine Strength</span><span style>". This made Qing Shui overjoyed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>To think that a flower which would only appear when one reached the Martial Commander grade seven with the Blue Lotus Art, would appear when his Blue Lotus Art had only reached the Martial Warrior grade four!</span></p>
  <p><span style>"This is not right!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui suddenly felt that something was amiss.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The color of the lotus flower!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lotus flower which should have been white was now a golden color. Qing Shui stood there in a daze, looking at the lotus flower before him which was exuding a faint light.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui controlled the movement of the lotus flower, increasing its speed, until sounds of the lotus slashing through the air could be heard.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gradually, the golden colored lotus flower which felt very light was in his complete control. Qing Shui noticed that it was because he had channeled in the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. The more he channeled in, the greater the level of exhaustion, but the lighter it became.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was just as his mother had said, that it could be used for both attack and defense, and to think that it also had additional effects and can be used as a weapon. It was just that there was a distance restriction and it could not exceed two meters from where he was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Qing Shui cut off his connection with the golden colored lotus flower, its color gradually turned faint as it dissipated in the air.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was just like the condensation of the Qi of Xiantian!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Did the Blue Lotus Art mutated?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could not help but think of that. He knew that this was all because of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, but to able to cultivate a lotus flower was still something which made him very happy. It was a pity that he could not probe out the actual prowess of this lotus flower.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hmmm, one flower?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui formed a hand sign again, and a golden colored lotus flower appeared. He then controlled the connection with this lotus and formed another hand sign.　</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was another golden colored lotus!</span></p>
  <p><span style>... </span></p>
  <p><span style>It was until the fourth golden colored lotus flower appeared and no matter how much he tried, he could not create a fifth. Qing Shui then knew that the fourth level Blue Lotus Art could only create four lotus flowers. Qing Shui only wanted to try out how many he could control.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt like smiling, looking at the row of golden colored lotus flowers placed before him. Just one of them alone was beautiful enough, and now with four of them, it was like the blossoming of a hundred flowers and was extremely beautiful!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui attempted to control the four flowers, but once he moved, the connection to two of them broke off. Qing Shui was unfaltered as he tried hard to control the remaining two. Qing Shui was already quite at ease when he tried to control just one of it earlier, but controlling two of them was still a bit tough for him. Thank goodness that Qing Shui had perseverance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gradually, Qing Shui found out another use for the spirit energy, which was to multitask, being able to do two, three, or even four things at once… </span></p>

In reality, the Xiao Clan is basically in the control of my eldest uncle and this woman from the Xiao Clan."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It may be because Yan Ling`er was infuriated, and could not help but wish that these savageous and cruel people could die earlier, Qing Shui finally saw it for himself that there was no kinship in reputable clans, such that it was possible even "he" had died in the hands of that woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Yan Clan's clan head doesn’t care about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Yan Clan should have plenty of experts who are loyal to the clan. Are they all just letting a woman putting the Yan Clan through all this while they do nothing at all?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui realized that things were not as simple as he had thought. Previously, he was prepared to head to the Yan Clan right after he had stepped into Xiantian. Thinking about it made him feel how childish his thought was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, he realized that the Yan Clan had an invisible thread connected to it and was very, very far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grandfather had handed the Yan Clan to my eldest uncle, and would not step out unless there are any major issues. There are some experts in the Yan Clan, but it's strange how they all seemed to have qualms about a certain person," Yan Ling`er said, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn't Yan Clan the strongest clan in the Yan Country?" Qing Shui felt that this person was certain the crux of everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was nothing but curiously from Qing Shui's tone. He knew that Yan Ling`er was simple-minded, but at least she was not stupid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Xiao Clan's clan head, Xiao Shishui. Rumor has it that he is an important character in a certain sect, and that sect is not one which a country could afford to offend," Yan Ling`er said worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did your Sister Qingqing came out to sell tea leaves? How did a Young Miss from the Yan Clan fell into such dire straits?" Qing Shui realized that till now, he had yet to understand this, so he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Four years ago, when Sister Qingqing was sixteen years old, the Xiao Clan's Eldest Young Master Xiao had wanted to take Sister Qingqing as his concubine, and Madam Xiao had actually agreed on her behalf. After all, she was already considered half a clan head then. But Sister Qingqing put up strong resistance, and just because of this, that Eldest Young Master Xiao got kicked by Sister Qingqing, at his critical part..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that she must have kicked the man's important part, but he knew that that Eldest Young Master Xiao was fine, since he had seen him when he first came to Greencloud Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What happened thereafter?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"After that, Sister Qingqing was chased out by Madam Xiao, who claimed to want to let her experience life like that of a beggar, to let her know how precious a life she had been living in the past, enjoying all the good clothing and good food. They had hoped that this would make Sister Qingqing change her mind, but they did not expect Sister Qingqing to have persisted for four years since then, not giving in no matter how hard life was."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui suddenly thought of the person called Guo Polu. While Qing Shui had not seen him before, he could never forget his name. It was because the lass his mother had been thinking of was indebted to him. Qing Shui would not forget the Yan Clan and the Xiao Clan either, since they were clans that he had set his mind on eliminating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are a kindhearted girl. I hope that when the day comes, you'll not hate me!" Qing Shui said and smiled lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Qing Shui's warming smile, she said, "Brother Qing Shui, that won't happen. Why would I hate you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui bade Yan Ling`er goodbye, and could not hold back his sigh. This girl did not simply just want to get closer to him. The other time, that lady Xi Yue had said some strange things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"One day, you'll cry. Go on and hate me, this was an encounter that should never have happened. It'll only make you feel worse." Qing Shui shook his head, entered the bedroom, and immediately entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recalling Yan Ling`er's words, he thought of how that "elder sister" had no one but herself to rely on. Qing Shui had initially thought that Yan Zhongyue would be good to her, since he had loved his mother, and would definitely treat their daughter well. Well, it seemed that he had done so, but it was a pity that he had died. Thinking about this, Qing Shui had the sudden urge to cry. He did not know why he felt this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It may be because he hated him, and had nowhere to vent his hatred...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation. He could only attempt to forget by focusing his mind on his cultivation. These things weighed down Qing Shui's heart as if they were a few big blocks of mountains, making it hard for him to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ancient Strengthening Technique circulated gradually. Suddenly, Qing Shui thought of his &lt;&lt;Blue Lotus Art&gt;&gt;, the &lt;&lt;Blue Lotus Art&gt;&gt; which he had abandoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he broke through to the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui had abandoned the Blue Lotus Art which he had trained to the 4th level. At that time, Qing Shui who had stepped into Xiantian felt that the biggest advantage of the Blue Lotus Art was to act as an aid to allow him to cultivate the Ancient Strengthening Technique successfully. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about it, Qing Shui realized that there were many things which could achieve an unbelievable effect at certain timings. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to continue his cultivation for the Blue Lotus Art. He looked forward to attaining the stage where he would be encompassed by nine lotus flowers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had not been cultivating this technique, Qing Shui did not lose his touch. After all, back then he practised the first four levels of the Blue Lotus Art an endless number of times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he did not know why after he had reached a breakthrough with his Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui realized that his Blue Lotus Art was at the lowest level amongst those of his age in the Qing Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique which was much stronger than the Blue Lotus Art gradually started to circulate, flowing through the meridian channels. Qing Shui circulated his Qi according the the Blue Lotus Art, but gradually added in the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. This was not something strange, since he had previously trained the two together before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this time around, Qing Shui felt that something was very different, although he could not really pinpoint it. He just felt that previously, there were many parts which did not seem smooth, but now everything was flowing smoothly without any resistance at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The feeling was akin to that of eating ice cream in the scorching summer, all 3,600,000 of his pores were cleared. However, Qing Shui did not feel surprised, but felt that this was how it should have been. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, whenever he achieved a breakthrough in his Ancient Strengthening Technique, his Blue Lotus Art would also gain a breakthrough of a similar level. This time around, Qing Shui felt that even if there was no breakthrough, he would at least be able to reach the pinnacle of the 4th level. Back then, Qing Shui had abandoned the Blue Lotus Art just after reaching the 4th level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time around, Qing Shui's practice went very smoothly, and he even felt as if everything was going out of hand, so much so that he was fully intoxicated in the feeling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was as if he had forgotten about the passing time, not expecting that he would be able to enter the ‘</span><span style>state of no concious’</span><span style> even when he was just practising the Blue Lotus Art. Most importantly, he had entered it unknowingly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Time passed by slowly, and suddenly, he stood up with his eyes closed, his hands pushed forth while forming a hand sign in the shape of a lotus, not creating a sound. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After pushing forth a hand sign, Qing Shui abruptly opened his eyes. A golden colored lotus flower the size of a basin appeared before him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a nine-petaled lotus flower!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at the translucent sparkly golden colored lotus flower which was beside him, beautiful as if it was just an illusion, exuding a strong aura. Qing Shui gradually reached out his hand towards it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui reached out his hands very slowly, afraid that it would disappear once he touched it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui noticed that there was a faint connection between him and the lotus, and it was just then when his hand touched the golden colored lotus flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s material... and hard!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had suspected it, he was still astonished. After all, it looked translucent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui used that weak connection to slowly control the lotus, and discovered that it could actually be moved about with flexibility. It was just that he needed to exhaust the Dan Tian's "</span><span style>Divine Strength</span><span style>". This made Qing Shui overjoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To think that a flower which would only appear when one reached the Martial Commander grade seven with the Blue Lotus Art, would appear when his Blue Lotus Art had only reached the Martial Warrior grade four!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is not right!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui suddenly felt that something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The color of the lotus flower!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lotus flower which should have been white was now a golden color. Qing Shui stood there in a daze, looking at the lotus flower before him which was exuding a faint light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui controlled the movement of the lotus flower, increasing its speed, until sounds of the lotus slashing through the air could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, the golden colored lotus flower which felt very light was in his complete control. Qing Shui noticed that it was because he had channeled in the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique. The more he channeled in, the greater the level of exhaustion, but the lighter it became.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just as his mother had said, that it could be used for both attack and defense, and to think that it also had additional effects and can be used as a weapon. It was just that there was a distance restriction and it could not exceed two meters from where he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Qing Shui cut off his connection with the golden colored lotus flower, its color gradually turned faint as it dissipated in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was just like the condensation of the Qi of Xiantian!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did the Blue Lotus Art mutated?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui could not help but think of that. He knew that this was all because of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, but to able to cultivate a lotus flower was still something which made him very happy. It was a pity that he could not probe out the actual prowess of this lotus flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hmmm, one flower?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui formed a hand sign again, and a golden colored lotus flower appeared. He then controlled the connection with this lotus and formed another hand sign.　</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was another golden colored lotus!</span></p>
 <p><span style>... </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was until the fourth golden colored lotus flower appeared and no matter how much he tried, he could not create a fifth. Qing Shui then knew that the fourth level Blue Lotus Art could only create four lotus flowers. Qing Shui only wanted to try out how many he could control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui felt like smiling, looking at the row of golden colored lotus flowers placed before him. Just one of them alone was beautiful enough, and now with four of them, it was like the blossoming of a hundred flowers and was extremely beautiful!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui attempted to control the four flowers, but once he moved, the connection to two of them broke off. Qing Shui was unfaltered as he tried hard to control the remaining two. Qing Shui was already quite at ease when he tried to control just one of it earlier, but controlling two of them was still a bit tough for him. Thank goodness that Qing Shui had perseverance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, Qing Shui found out another use for the spirit energy, which was to multitask, being able to do two, three, or even four things at once… </span></p>
