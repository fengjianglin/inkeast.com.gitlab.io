 <p><strong>AST 1457 - Great Sky Demon Magic, Naughty Finger, Her Smile </strong></p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>A loud bang echoed. The attack threw Qing Shui backward. By now, Qing Shui should have been considered quite powerful, yet despite this, the old man still forced him back. This result, however, ignited Qing Shui’s spirit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique was very powerful. Even after the old man weakened, he still possessed the Demon Lord King’s Inheritance. He managed to push Qing Shui back with a simple and plain attack. From there, it was clear that the opponent was at least 30% stronger than Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This meant that, compared to Old Man Lu, this old man’s strength was far superior. The world certainly didn’t lack capable people. The Soaring Dragon Continent was vast and boundless. However, the Greencloud Continent, which supposedly didn’t have any Martial Saints, turned out to have General Manor. Hence, what was visible on the surface was only useful as a &nbsp;reference. It must not be considered a genuine source.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even the Bloody Butcher, Chen Yuanhua was startled. Originally, he did not believe that Qing Shui should be so powerful given his age, even if he had received the Battle God Inheritance. Furthur more, a woman still stood beside him. He was well aware that the woman was a descendant of the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>Just before Qing Shui charged forward, an alabaster hand pulled him back, “Let me do it!”</p>
 <p>The hand belonged to Tantai Lingyan. She pulled Qing Shui aside, and with a few flashes, charged towards the old man. Her strength had temporarily increased by 45%; she was almost as strong as the old man. She also expertly wielded a Martial Saint Level Demonic Weapon. She had also received the true Demon Lord Inheritance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directed the Dragon Slaying Beast to follow after Tantai Lingyan. Every time it saw an opportunity, it would launch its attacks at the old man. When necessary, it would also save Tantai Lingyan.</p>
 <p>Random Dance of the Sky Demon!</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan’s inheritance was of the Sky Demon Lord. She cultivated the Great Sky Demon Magic, unleashing it for the first time in this battle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her figure was so elegant that it didn’t seem like it belonged in the mortal world, while the long sword in her hand seemed blood-thirsty and wicked. She looked like a fairy dwelling in hell. She was an enchantress among the fairies.</p>
 <p>Blood Heavy Strike!</p>
 <p>An enormous bloody claw abruptly charged its way towards Tantai Lingyan. Threads of bloody silk unraveled from the claw. It felt both malicious and cruel. It looked just like a Blood Terminator opening its mouth, attempting to swallow Tantai Lingyan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sky Demon Deadly Sword!</p>
 <p>Displaying her agility, Tantai Lingyan avoided the claw. In an instant, the Sky Demon Sword shone bright and colorful as it slashed towards Chen Yuanhua.</p>
 <p>Chen Yuanhua’s expression changed. He abruptly took three steps back and formed a triangle with his massive sword before thrusting it towards Tantai Lingyan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hong-hong-hong!</p>
 <p>Three consecutive explosions reverberated through their surroundings. The entire area crumbled into ruins as a result. Though almost unnoticeable, the sun, moon, and stars looked down on the battle. The five elements in the surroundings fell into chaos.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Dragon Slaying Beast shot out, attacking the instant Chen Yuanhua let his guard down.</p>
 <p>“You animal, you seek death!”</p>
 <p>Chen Yuanhua abruptly thrust his huge palm forward, retreating back a step at the same moment.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>The attack struck the Dragon Slaying Beast. Despite this, it still bit down on Chen Yuanhua’s arm, tearing off a small chunk. Fresh blood poured from the wound.</p>
 <p>At this moment, armed with the Golden Battle Halberd, Qing Shui charged forward.</p>
 <p>Against strong warriors like this, winning with numbers was ordinary. Let alone back then, the Demon Lord Palace was being ganged up on. Hence, whether one was powerful or weak was very important. The same also went for their ability to influence the people around them. The means were unimportant as long as they emerged victorious in the end.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s managed to land quite a beautiful strike with his attack. It immediately blasted Chen Yuanhua backward.</p>
 <p>Great Bloody Slaying Hand Seal!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chen Yuanhua single-handedly formed a complicated seal and thrust it towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took the hit! Chen Yuanhua seemed shocked. It hadn’t seemed like Qing Shui intended to avoid it. In the same moment, Qing Shui summoned his Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the old man had some killer-moves up his sleeves. He didn’t want to risk it. Since his opponent had an open wound in his arm, he immediately summoned his Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. He chose to act the moment his opponent was distracted.</p>
 <p>Once the Marrow-Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm entered the body, the only fate awaiting the victim was death. Compared to the Dragon Slaying Beast, it was equally dangerous. The Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm of the past could not compare to the current one in Qing Shui’s possession. Its danger wasn’t something to be taken lightly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Someone who had achieved strength of this level would notice if something entered their body. The old man didn’t seem to hesitate before he swung his sword and chopped off his arm. Coincidentally, he cut off the part containing the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. He blocked his body with his sword and once again took a big step back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Paragon Golden Armor to unleash his ability to block a fatal strike once and obtained one of the old man’s arms in return.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This result was quite satisfactory!</p>
 <p>The old man increased his distance from his enemy. Thus, the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm had no choice but to return. Despite how powerful it may be, it had a fatal weakness. It couldn’t survive if exposed to the air for too long. Furthermore, its body wasn’t as strong as the Dragon Slaying Beast’s. However, this did not change the fact that it was powerful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chen Yuanhua’s face was extremely pale. He had lost quite a lot of blood. Even though he controlled his blood loss now, if he engaged in battle and operated his qi and blood, blood would continue to flow out of his body.</p>
 <p>“Bloody Butcher, you killed almost thirty of my family members in the past. You deserve your death today. Stop resisting.” Tantai Lingyan slowly made her way towards Chen Yuanhua.</p>
 <p>“Come at me! I might be able bed one of you before I die.” The old man held his sword in his left hand. The sword shone with green light. A very faint red light glittered within the green on the blade.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It might be possible if you had two hands, but now, I suppose you have no hope left.”</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan charged Chen Yuanhua.</p>
 <p>Soul-stealing Sky Demon!</p>
 <p>A bewitching aura emerged from Tantai Lingyan’s body. The Sky Demon Sword in her hand appeared as though it had come to life. A bewitching red light immediately immobilized the old man.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>The old man spurted fresh blood, and he flew backward. As that happened, he revealed a dispirited expression.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even Tantai Lingyan felt a bit tired, but as she closed in towards the old man with her body, she launched the longsword in her hand, piercing Chen Yuanhua’s body.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held Tantai Lingyan who was on the verge of collapse. Though the Soul-stealing Sky Demon was powerful, its consumption of one’s energy was just as terrifying. If the opponent’s strength was vast, there was even a chance of backlash.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I am fine. I just exhausted too much of my Spirit Energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered the Vital Essence Pill, but he hesitated on whether he should reveal it. For now, Tantai Lingyan was cradled in his arms. It was a rare chance for him to enjoy such a warm moment with her. When she was tired, the woman didn’t seem as cold as before. She slightly knitted her brows as a hint that she was exhausted and felt uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>He took out a bottle of Vital Essence Pill and removed one, “Have one of these. Your wound will heal immediately.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held the Vital Essence Pill in his hand and slowly extended it towards the woman’s mouth. The woman opened her mouth slightly. Qing Shui then placed the Vital Essence Pill on her tongue. The soft and delicate sensation he felt as his fingers brushed her lips caused a ruckus in his heart. Just as he basked in the feeling, he carelessly slipped his thumb into her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He managed to feel the soft and pink tip of her tongue. She couldn’t help but snort as a refreshing feeling overtook his body The noise she made startled Qing Shui; it sounded so erotic.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he felt an excruciating pain at the tip of his finger. He instinctively pulled back his hand only to find blood welling from a small wound. When Qing Shui saw the woman’s ice-cold and sharp glare, he revealed an awkward smile, “I didn’t do it on purpose. Please believe me.”</p>
 <p>The Vital Essence Pill was very powerful. It took the woman less than a moment to recover her strength. She stood up straight and said, “Thank you for your medicinal pill.”</p>
 <p>“These are for you. Don’t use more than three a day. Otherwise, it will be harmful to your body.” Qing Shui gave about ten bottles of Vital Essence Pill to her.</p>
 <p>The woman didn’t hesitate to accept them. After taking Chen Yuanhua’s Interspatial Silk Sachet and his sword, she lit his body on fire and burned the corpse. After that, they immediately made their way back towards the palace.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that there hadn’t been many changes in the woman and sighed of relief. His previous action had really been idiotic. On top of that, the woman showed him no mercy. Even though he had caused her to bleed before, he never expected her to do the same to him. The only difference was source of the blood, the wound located on the tip of his thumb.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Lingyan, will you ever smile?”</p>
 <p>The woman remained silent.</p>
 <p>“Lingyan, have you ever cried before?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Even Qing Shui realized he sounded a bit naggy, but in front of this woman, he had no choice. He wanted her to become comfortable with conversation to encourage her to talk as often as possible.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She might still blame Qing Shui for his previous actions. From the moment she thanked him for his medicinal pills, she hadn’t muttered a single word.</p>
 <p>“So, there are times when even you are angry. That’s great!” Qing Shui said happily, glancing at the woman who was currently a bit grumpy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words stunned Tantai Lingyan. She turned and looked at Qing Shui, “Do you feel happy when I am mad?”</p>
 <p>“I would rather see you mad than see you emotionless all the time. At least when you are angry, I feel a sense of familiarity from you and can feel your presence,” Qing Shui smiled as he explained.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The woman fell silent. She turned around and only decided to speak gently after quite a while, “Thank you. I have noticed a lot of changes in me during this time. I really enjoy this feeling, and I appreciate your kindness.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to thank me. I did this of my own free will. Since I was still young and energetic, I have never once forgotten about you. As a matter of fact, you were one of the factors that enabled me to continue increasing my strength.”</p>
 <p>“To be frank with you, I am not even sure myself how much you currently weigh in my heart. You also joined the Demon Lord Palace because of me. Tell me, who shall I view you as?” In Tantai Lingyan’s eyes, there seemed to be some complexity. It was faint, almost indiscernible.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I tell you before? Treat me like your own family member. Don’t worry; I will harm myself before any harm ever comes to you. Believe me.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, I believe in you. Otherwise, I wouldn’t talk to you as much as I do now nor would I have accepted your gifts.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You might not understand the feeling of when someone is willing to do something for another, no matter the cost. He doesn’t ask for anything in return, and he will never hope for the other person to care about it too much. The only thing the person needs from the other is a faint smile. Of course, I am well aware that asking for a smile from you is a bit too much. All I need from you is a meaningful glance.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Is that so?”</p>
 <p>The woman looked at Qing Shui. She smiled. Although it looked really stiff and almost unnoticeable, it was obvious that she did smile! The smile she revealed was faint. Though it was only for an instant, it was a smile that could warm one’s heart, a smile that resembled a spring breeze. It was a smile even capable of blossoming a flower.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You look really beautiful!” Qing Shui was frozen in shock for a long moment. By the time he came back to his senses, the woman’s smile was long gone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In his heart, Qing Shui felt as if he had just swallowed a whole lot of honey. It was an incredibly sweet moment for him. To think that this woman would actually reveal a smile in front of him... Qing Shui had never expected a moment like this to occur. However, it was also only Qing Shui who was aware of how much effort he had expended for this woman.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They arrived at the palace. Both Hua Rumei and Zhan Yu were there. Hua Rumei sighed in relief when she saw both of them back. She asked anxiously, “How did it go?”</p>
 <p>“We are still alive, but our opponent has died,” Qing Shui smiled as he reported.</p>
 <p>“That’s great. Are you guys alright? You guys aren’t injured, are you?” Hua Rumei asked in concern.&nbsp;</p>
