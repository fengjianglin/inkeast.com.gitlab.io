 <p><strong>AST 1095 - Nine Yang Golden Body, Force of the Skeleton </strong></p>
 <p><span>Even though the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly and Jade Emperor Queen Bee absorbed Dragon Qi, they still have not reached the level of Martial Emperor. However, Qing Shui believed that it would be possible for the Jade Emperor Queen Bee to evolve into the Jade Emperor Dragon Bee.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly had no change. It simply transformed into scenery within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span>As for the hundreds of normal Jade Emperor Bees that have absorbed Dragon Qi, their strength sudden surged. Compared to the current Jade Emperor Queen Bee, there was still a huge margin, but their body sizes have expanded quite a bit. This lead Qing Shui to believe that there was potential, perhaps the change would be in the Bee Nectar.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing everything related to him undergo these tremendous changes. These beasts, in particular, were his best aids, therefore his success would be extraordinary in the future. Alongside his women and their beasts, their overall combined strength was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p>
 <p><span>In addition, there was the life-saving Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span>Up until now, Qing Shui finally recalled that he had absorbed a lot of Dragon Qi. It was comparable to the amount taken in by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Moreover, he remembered his spiritual sense telling him that his Nine Yang Golden Body had reached the small success stage.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Nine Yang Golden Body? Does that mean the bones become a pale golden color?” Qing Shui entered his consciousness with curiosity and looked at the message within his spiritual sense. He was anticipating a surge to his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nine Yang Golden Body, small success stage! Skeletal strength becomes as strong as boulders. With Force of the Skeleton, the body’s various functions, toughness, and vitality all increased by onefold.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just those few words left Qing Shui ecstatic. He had already sensed it, but he was not certain. He felt his physical strength increase by approximately 10,000 stars, similar to the original increase on Nine Continents Mountain. This power came from the bones and skeletons, however, since it was the Force of the Skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Qing Shui cultivated the Ancient Strengthening Technique in the past, he had discovered faint, golden sparkles of light on his bones. The higher the realm, the more sparkles there were. After he had absorbed Dragon Qi, his skeleton had completely turned a slight golden color.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was an undoubted fact that the Ancient Strengthening Technique had the ability to turn his body into the Nine Yang Golden Body, especially with the huge boost after absorbing Dragon Qi. Had it not been for the Dragon Qi, Qing Shui figures it would take a very long time to reach Nine Yang Golden Body.</span></p>
 <p><span>His physical strength had increased one fold, just above 22,000 stars… </span></p>
 <p><span>Just as Qing Shui was stunned, more surprises appeared spontaneously. Upon feeling the power move violently within his body, he immediately began to use Skywalk and Taichi Fist.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had just received huge rewards in the Ancient Ruins, he did not expect to receive another huge surprise coming out. It was not inferior to the benefit received within the Ancient Ruins.</span></p>
 <p><span>Single Whip!</span></p>
 <p><span>Cloudhand!</span></p>
 <p><span>……</span></p>
 <p><span>……</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui closed his eyes while suspended in midair. He did not excessively use all of the power within his body. Moreover, he was breathing, stretching, and tempering while continuously circulating his Taichi Fist. This allows for the power within his body to better integrate with his bones and skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span>Once he started, he spent the next three days practicing. Luckily, Qing Shui was inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, therefore it was easy for him to enter a clear state of mind. His entire body and mind were completely devoted to practice. His efficiency was amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Seventh Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique had finally reached its peak. Another step and Qing Shui would breakthrough to the Eighth Layer realm. Even though Qing Shui knew that it was one step away, he felt as though it was far beyond the horizon. It were as if the distance was light years away.</span></p>
 <p><span>After resting and eating, he continued to cultivate. He had familiarized himself with the sudden surge of power. Qing Shui’s strength had increased by onefold from its original foundation. His spirit energy attack could reach a frightening 2.4 million stars</span><span>……</span></p>
 <p><span>His physical body, however, was limited by the Laws of Heaven and Earth. Thus, his strength was greatly reduced. On the other hand, the Nine Continent Mountain’s power can be fully utilized now. Even with his physical body on the five continents, he was still a top-tier existence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even with the restriction of the Laws of Heaven and Earth on his physical strength, he could still reach 180,000 stars. This &nbsp;was because the Nine Continent Mountain was a twofold multiplier that allowed him to reach approximately 360,000 stars. Qing Shui felt that, with his physical body alone, he could rampage about the five continents.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui had spent the last several days crafting rings from the Sacred Jade Divine Stone. The piece of Sacred Jade Divine Stone was not very big, but it could be used to create many Sacred Jade Divine Stone rings. Though he could not make one for every member of the Qing Clan, he could make enough for members that needed a ring.</span></p>
 <p><span>The next day, Qing Shui woke up early and began practicing his Fists. However, he was the latest to wake up because he knew that the women had not rested at all. All of them had continued to cultivate throughout the night, familiarizing themselves with their increase in strength. They could not stay inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal like Qing Shui could.</span></p>
 <p><span>After getting up, Qing Shui greeted them and found an open area to continue practicing his Taichi Fists. The morning sun rose on the east, and during this auspicious hour, it was crucial for Qing Shui to cultivate. In the morning, there is a critical hour to cultivate that could match more than half of a day’s worth of cultivating. There were indirect benefits for cultivating during this hour as well, therefore this was a crucial time during the day that he never wanted to waste.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui stopped and went to make breakfast as it was almost time. He had already cultivated during the most important time and, after seeing that the women needed some time, went ahead and to make breakfast himself without asking them to.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was only very late that night that everyone finally stopped. A full night of cultivating had left each of them revitalized. At dinnertime, everyone ate a lot. They all seemed to have a great appetite, or perhaps they were just in a good mood.</span></p>
 <p><span>Several of the women’s strength increased by a lot after one night. Qing Shui discovered that they had grown stronger by about twofold that of their previous strength, although it was only strength. After the restriction from the Laws of Heaven and Earth, there was not much strength remaining.</span></p>
 <p><span>This night was crucial. It was for the same purpose Qing Shui had spent the last three days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the integration and absorption of the Dragon Qi within the body. In the future, their cultivation speed would be much faster than before.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was not in a rush to leave, but instead, fed them attacks and let them practice attacking Qing Shui. Using this method of realistic combat would better enable them to familiarize themselves with their own power.</span></p>
 <p><span>When darkness fell, he would use Nine Continents Step just like before. Then, he would set up camp and continue to cultivate by himself, followed by some rest…</span></p>
 <p><span>This time they had felt the benefit and strength of Nine Continents Step. Many of them needed time to cultivate. If they were only concerned about hurrying along the path, they would lose too much cultivation time. After all, they had absorbed Dragon Qi. If they did not have Nine Continents Steps, then they would find a place to retreat and quietly cultivate.</span></p>
 <p><span>Along the way, it was very calm. Although there were the occasional beasts, they were all scared off by the beasts that were with them!</span></p>
 <p><span>Time past unknowingly and the strengths of the women as well as Fattie have settled down. Seeing their strength increase made Qing Shui throb. Should he bring them to the other four continents?</span></p>
 <p><span>After returning to the big yard where Yiye Tian was, everyone was exceptionally happy. Yiye Tian and his wife were happy after they saw Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui, and Luanluan return unscathed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lin Zhanhan was also happy seeing Qing Shui and them. Qing Shui was smiling as he approached him to talk about something. Yiye Jiange, Luan Luan, and Yiye Tian were also talking.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qing Shui, how was the gains from the Ancient Ruins?” Lin Zhanhan and Qing Shui discussed over some tea.</span></p>
 <p><span>They were at a stone table. In the village where conditions were not considered luxurious, it was comparably quiet and calming. This was a type of serenity that a typical city did not have.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Very good, it can be regarded as a huge advantage. That’s right, Grandpa Lin, let us go outside. I have a small present for you.” Qing Shui stood up and pullied gramps along as they stepped outside.</span></p>
 <p><span>This place was not far from the mountains. They had found an open space, whereupon Qing Shui retrieved a Demonic Beast Token with a beast sealed within. He released a Shadow Demonic Panther that had been caught the other day. He had three in total, and now, he still had two left.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui did not have to use his hands to control the Shadow Demonic Panther!</span></p>
 <p><span>Lin Zhanhan was looking at Qing Shui with astonishment. Seeing the Shadow Demonic Panther, he opened his mouth but could not form any words.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Grandpa Lin, this is a gift for you. This is a bottle of Medicinal Pills. The small ones are for you to eat, while the large ones are for the Shadow Demonic Panther. From now on, it will become your mount.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Eh, Qing Shui, Grandpa Lin is getting old, these things are of no use anymore. Leave them for Qing Clan’s younger generation.” Lin Zhanhan shook his head as spoke to Qing Shui, smiling with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Grandpa Lin, I don’t want the younger generation of the Qing Clan to have this sort of dependence. This would make them lose their motivation to become stronger. I may leave not long from now, and this will ensure your safety, as well as the safety of Qing Clan.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then, how come you did not tame one for your grandfather?” Lin Zhanhan said after some thought.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Grandfather has one and so does mother. This one is for you. The one I have saved for grandfather and the one I have saved for you are the same. When the time comes, they could also be partners.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lin Zhanhan did not hesitate anymore after this, successfully taming the beast. Qing Shui could feel Lin Zhanhan’s body changing. Qing Shui noticed that he had completely used up the effects of the low grade Sacred Beast Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lin Zhanhan’s power was much weaker compared to Qing Shui and the women. There was a chance for failure, so Qing Shui had prepared the Gold Needles in advance. He would immediately act if there was an accident, but everything had gone smoothly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lin Zhanhan was very happy that he tamed such a formidable beast. From time to time, he would touch it here and pet it elsewhere, as if he was in a dream. He had never known the Shadow Demonic Panther’s original strength. Now that he was capable in communicating with the Shadow Demonic Panther, he was shaken after discovering its strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui had originally prepared one for Yiye Tian, but Yiye Jiange told him not to. Her brother was not very old, and if he had given him such a formidable beast, it would not benefit him at all. They were better off giving him Medicinal Pills for cultivating or techniques and whatnot.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui thought for a bit and went with her suggestion. Not to mention, Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan were already quite formidable. They were more than powerful enough to give pointers to Yiye Tian. Yiye Tian was a beast tamer, as well, therefore he probably knew quite a bit as a part of the Yiye clan.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui intended to leave the low grade Sacred Beast Pill used for taming beasts to the elderly or members of the family that would no longer be able to breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span>This time, dinner was particularly sumptuous. With many people at the table, it was especially boisterous. Yiye Tong seemed to like clinging to Luan Luan and Yiye Jiange. Yiye Tong sat between Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan, talking nonstop.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yiye Tian and his wife were the happiest. Not only were they able to find their long-lost daughter, they also met up with their sister. Moreover, they could enter the Lion King’s Ridge and seek revenge for the bloodbath that happened years ago.</span></p>
