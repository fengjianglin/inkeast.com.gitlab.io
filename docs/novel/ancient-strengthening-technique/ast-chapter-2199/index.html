Let me see if you’re the real deal or not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he finished saying this, he stepped towards Qing Shui.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By this time, Qing Shui had already brought his strength up to maximum, using all his formations and the Battle God Halo. He knew that this time he had met someone who was truly powerful, and one slip up would be costly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad, young man. Let’s see what you can do against my attacks.”</span></p>

It had the top full of fire, and was powerful enough to burn the souls of people. The volcano was also very strong in attack power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A veteran would be able to tell how dangerous it was by reaching out. This simple motion explained the power behind it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attack power of the Nine Continents Mountain had already reached 27 billion Dao, and on top of that, it had the strength of the shield attack. Even if it wasn’t a true shield attack, it could diminish some of the attack power of the opposing force. If it were actually a true shield attack, it would completely suppress its attack power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The chance that the Nine Continents Mountain would be able to completely nullify the opposing attack was low, but the shield attack was still there, about 20 to 30 percent, and could nullify another 20 to 30 percent of the enemy’s attack during this fluctuating time. But even with that, the Nine Continents Mountain was beaten away by the little volcano.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was beaten away, the power that the little volcano had been left with wasn’t much and under it, the large red Demonic Vines wrapped around the little volcano had disappeared in a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main purpose of the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines was pestering strength, toughness, and sturdiness. Its attack power was secondary. Furthermore, it had sharp and menacing bloodthirsty spikes. The Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines were very different from before, their power incomparable to the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lie Hunren saw that his own little volcano had dissipated, he couldn’t help but look at Qing Shui. This young man’s strength wasn’t too bad, and wasn’t just all talk. Unfortunately, he wasn’t of his family, and was even an enemy, so he couldn’t let him go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this thought came out, it was like a seed sprouting its roots, continuously growing. This prompted Lie Hunren to quickly make a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a surge of killing intent. He didn’t think that the palace lord of the Blazing Fire Immortal Palace would want to kill him. However, this killing intent was real and extremely intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui clenched his two fists together, then used the Diamond White Tiger King. He then afterward also used the Dragon Spider, the Buddha Diamond Seal, and without batting an eye, put a Buddha Wisdom Seal on Lie Hunren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He unleashed the power of the Divine Weapon Flying Sword. This way, he could minimize the damage to the people around, increasing their vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I see. You’re trying to use those two Beasts to control me. Funny.” Lie Hunren looked at Qing Shui without a trace of dismay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Art of Pursuing, Emperor’s Qi!</span></p>

A dark colored light flashed, increasing his strength a decent amount. However, it wasn’t for recovery, but only a temporary boost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, and as his hand moved, another white light surrounded Lie Hunren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Area Dominance.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lie Hunren moved. He knew that he needed to get rid of this young man even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Bright Seal.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first to strike was the one with the advantage. Qing Shui also didn’t want to be careless and immediately used the Buddha Bright Seal and Stellar Transposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Stellar Transposition was still very menacing, Qing Shui was thinking of using the Buddha Bright Seal to make his opponent become disoriented for a bit, lowering his opponent’s strength, while further increasing his own attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Stellar Transposition bypassed defense, so Qing Shui had no idea what to suppose in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What surprised Qing Shui was that this Buddha Bright Seal had a strong effect on Lie Hunren. Last time, when he was fighting the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master, his opponent had Demon Shadow Splitting so he wasn’t sure whether this Lie Hunren took the attack on purpose or not. He decided not to think about it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pop!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Stellar Transposition hit Lie Hunren’s body, blowing him away with a trail of fresh blood coming from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, Qing Shui knew that Lie Hunren had actually been hit by him. Still, that guy’s resistance was very strong. He didn’t even think about preparing defenses against an attack that would bypass them, which meant that the only thing left was his own life force. The stronger the life force, the less of an effect the attack would have and the quicker it would be to recover from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed that this Lie Hunren’s life force was pretty strong. Qing Shui’s Stellar Transposition wasn’t anything weak. Even though it had not reached 70 billion Dao, it had the defense bypass power of about 10 billion, which was enough to injure his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, his strength had been crippled a little, and now it was just enough for Qing Shui to have an effect on him. Actually, Lie Hunren’s power now wasn’t too low, but it also was enough to delay the fight. Of course, his strength would also continue to diminish as the fight went on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The way the Lie Hunren was looking at Qing Shui was just like that of a devil. A large blade of fire appeared in his hand, and he suddenly rushed towards Qing Shui; his speed enough for people’s hairs to stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Windwhisk Willow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart jumped, then quickly used Windwhisk Willow.</span></p>

At this moment, however, he found that he had burst through the bottleneck like window paper. They had managed to combine perfectly and allowed him to dodge Lie Hunren’s vicious blade.</span></p>

Someone had evaded it. Someone had evaded his own blade. He couldn’t figure out what that young guy’s movement technique was either, which was too weird.</span></p>

He didn’t have a weapon in his hand because he knew that it wouldn’t matter even if he did have one. He continuously dodged, using the Buddha Bright Seal and Gouging Strike every now and then, along with the Dragon-capturing Hands, and didn’t dare use anything else against a person of Lie Hunren’s caliber. It was already too risky in close range. One misstep would spell his end even if he had a stronger defense.</span></p>

Those movements were too peculiar. They could see that Qing Shui was using Windwhisk Willow, but it seemed to be even stronger than usual.</span></p>

This young man had such a strange movement. It was way too scary, making him think that this guy had some weird feeling to it. Qing Shui had Windwhisk Willow, and now it had been combined with the Nine Palace Steps. Meanwhile, Lie Hunren’s strength did not lie with his speed, which was now halved. Even if he struck out with strength, he couldn’t hit his target, which was the power of speed.</span></p>

When he was starting to be angered by this fact, Qing Shui moved his hand again.</span></p>
