 <p><strong>AST 805 - Heart of Roc At the Small Success Stage</strong></p>
 <p>Heart of Roc！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he was just a little bit away from reaching the small success stage but it was just hard to make a breakthrough and he felt quite depressed about this. When it was with the Roc Spreading Wings, it was still considered easy but this Heart of Roc was much more difficult. However, he felt that the Roc Combat Skills that would follow next might be even more difficult.</p>
 <p>To a certain degree, having difficulty was a good thing. Amongst battle techniques, powerful techniques were not something which one could succeed in easily. Therefore, this was considered normal.</p>
 <p>"Roc Spreading Wings" took him about five to six months to reach the small success stage but it seemed like it would take him seven to eight months to reach the small success stage for the Heart of Roc.</p>
 <p>And this time around, Qing Shui felt that he was almost there. He should be able to reach the small success stage for the Heart of Roc in at most one day. He was full of anticipation for this moment's arrival. The prowess of the Primordial Flame Balls which was going to be two times stronger than before was not something which could be undermined. That killing prowess could almost be a match for the five-colored poison.</p>
 <p>Feeling tired, Qing Shui decided to take a small break before refining medicinal pills. He had the alchemy recipes for the Bone Tempering Pellet and Skin Tempering Pellet and he had medicinal herbs on hand as well. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to give them a go.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first sorted out the medicinal herbs before preparing them for easy access later. All medicinal herbs needed to be refined beforehand, otherwise, it would be more troublesome later and the success rate would also be lower. Most people would first refine them into powder.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui added them in bit by bit in turn. He activated his spiritual sense to control the primordial flames which were now very powerful. He had a powerful spiritual sense, extremely precious Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and most importantly, the primordial flames.</p>
 <p>When refining demon, fire could even take up 50% of the importance of the project. Many people tended to fail because of the lack of control on the fire. Qing Shui was considered to be quite lucky.</p>
 <p>This process of refining took him one day. High grade medicinal pills took an exceptional amount of time to refine. If not because of that, they would not have been so expensive. However, Qing Shui was not concerned since he had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>When that crisp sharp voice rang out, Qing Shui came to a stop happily. Everytime he performed alchemy, he would feel proud of his heaven-defying success rate. This was the difference. What that alchemists were the most proud of was to see whose success rate in alchemy was higher.</p>
 <p>The more precious the medicinal pills, the lower the success rate and the harder it was to refine them. Each failure in attempting to refine precious medicinal pills was a great loss and this was also why precious medicinal pills were so expensive. There were times where there might not even be a single success attempt out of ten tries.</p>
 <p>After 15 minutes, Qing Shui opened the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and a faint scent was released. It was not an exceptionally nice scent but gave people the feeling that one would not feel sick of it no matter how long they were exposed to it.</p>
 <p>There were 12 greenish brown colored medicinal pills in the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, each of them glittering and translucent. Without a second thought, Qing Shui popped one into his mouth while storing the remaining pills into a porcelain bottle.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, he sensed that the skin throughout his body was tightening up. It was as if something was tugging it. At the start, it felt very comfortable but eventually, although it did not feel uncomfortable, he had the feeling that his skin felt very tight and tensed.</p>
 <p>This feeling continued for one whole hour. Qing Shui looked at his skin and did not notice any tremendous changes to it. However, through his spiritual sense, he could tell that there was stronger vitality to his skin and it was slightly tougher as well.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, there's still effect." Qing Shui was very happy. Although the effect was not great, it was better than having none at all. Moreover, it was something which could be accumulated. He could take one once a month and there were no other restrictions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then moved on to refining the Bone Tempering Pellet. Similarly, he took one right on the spot. He noticed that the strength of his bones had really increased a little as compared to before. Qing Shui's bones were very strong to begin with but he had not expected to still be able to strengthen it more, even if it was just a little that it was almost insignificant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not refine the "Divine Awakening Pellet". He merely spent the rest of his time on his cultivation, waiting in anticipation for his breakthrough.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was just turning dark outside. A tempting fragrance of food welcomed him the moment he stepped out and he knew that they were in the midst of preparing dinner.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw Qingqing coming out from the kitchen. In Qing Residence, cooking was not done by the servants but all women with time on their hands would help out, even Yiye Jiange, Di Chen and the others. That was why sometimes Qing Shui would help them out in the kitchen, taking the chance to also see what these beautiful ladies looked like in the kitchen.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p>"Sister, let me give you some things." Qing Shui smiled and passed the remaining Skin Tempering Pellet and Bone Tempering Pellet to Qingqing.</p>
 <p>"What are these?" Qingqing asked.</p>
 <p>"Take one of each every month." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"It's for increasing your cultivation." Qing Shui then continued to say.</p>
 <p>The medicinal herbs for the Skin Tempering Pellet and Bone Tempering Pellet were extremely precious but the martial arts that Qing Shui cultivated were the best ones to temper one's body and thus the effect taking these pills had on him were almost insignificant. If the Ancient Strengthening Technique had reached the seventh heavenly layer, Qing Shui feel that these pills would not have any effect on him. This was why he had given all of them to Qingqing. Although it would not have much effect on him, the same did not go for Qingqing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let Qingqing go back to her room and take one of each while he went into the kitchen. It was still relatively early and it would probably still be about another hour before dinner was ready. Recently, Qing Clan had been having their dinner later. This was also why Qing Shui told Qingqing to head back to her room first to take the pills.</p>
 <p>There was Qing Yi and Qing Shui's two aunts in the kitchen, as well as Qing Bei, Di Qing, Di Chen and Canghai Mingyue. The rest of the people were in the hall, some playing with the kids while others were chatting.</p>
 <p>"Brother Shui!" On seeing Qing Shui, Qing Bei called out happily.</p>
 <p>When the others saw him, they told him to head to the hall. Usually, guys would not enter the kitchen. However, he just smiled and said, "I'll make some food for the kids."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood between Canghai Mingyue and Di Chen. What he was making was crabs. It was good for the kids to have more seafood; they'll grow to become more intelligent. Canghai Mingyue and Di Chen stood beside him and watched as he prepared it.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue knew that Qing Clan was making it for Qing Zun and Qin Yin. The other two kids were still too young and could not eat them yet. But no matter what Qing Shui made, he would always save a portion for Luan Luan and Yuchang. To him, the two of them were also kids.</p>
 <p>Each of the crabs he was making now were the size of two palms and just one of them was sufficient for the younger kids to be full. Even Luan Luan and Yuchang would be almost full with that.</p>
 <p>"Mingyue, in the past, did Qing Shui cook a lot of good food for you?" Di Qing walked over and smiled, asking to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, that's right." Canghai Mingyue smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Qing Shui knew that he needed to make more portions.</p>
 <p>"Now, he only dotes on the kids. Whatever we want to eat, we'll have to make it ourselves." Di Qing grinned, seeming as if there was no implied meaning behind her words.</p>
 <p>"That's right. In the past, he doted on me the most. But now, I don't even know where I stand as his younger sister." Qing Bei pouted and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head and answered helplessly with a smile, "Everyone will have a share tonight."</p>
 <p>That night, Qing Shui did not need to go back to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. After playing with the kids for a while, everyone went back. The kids had dozed off and Qing Shui left together with Di Chen.</p>
 <p>"Aren't you going to sleep?" Seeing that Qing Shui had entered her room, Di Chen asked.</p>
 <p>"I am. I've decided to sleep here tonight." Qing Shui said shamelessly.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!" Di Chen chided softly.</p>
 <p>"I know, don't worry, I won't eat you up." Qing Shui carried Di Chen and headed for the bedroom.</p>
 <p>"Ahh, you rascal." Di Chen pounded Qing Shui angrily as a flush of red appeared on her face.</p>
 <p>This lady, who was like a goddess from the heavens, gave Qing Shui a great mental impact. Although he could not really have sex with her, he could at least enjoy the mental impact he could feel when he was together with her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged Di Chen as he sat on her bed. The bed was soft and comfortable, pure white with not a trace of dust. The entire room had a faint fragrance which was similar to the fragrance on Di Chen.</p>
 <p>"You're not allowed to touch me. In the future, I'll be yours." Di Chen said softly.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Di Chen were wearing thin nightwear. Under the moonlight, her beautiful figure was fully displayed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged Di Chen and said with affirmation, "Is your husband someone who can't hold it in? When you don't agree to it, I won't make you do something that you don't want."</p>
 <p>"It's not that I'm not willing to. Can you give me a little time?" Di Chen hugged Qing Shui lightly and said.</p>
 <p>"So.. you're willing to do it with me?" Qing Shui grinned.</p>
 <p>"You rascal. Would you only be satisfied to have me say such obscene stuff?" Di Chen pounded Qing Shui angrily.</p>
 <p>"That's not true. I just want you to say it only to me. Chen`er, don't you think that saying it will make it sound special? Between the two of us, if you're still so restrained, won't we lose out a lot of fun? There won't be the fun feelings a couple share when they're together." Qing Shui smiled and flipped over to be on top of Di Chen. The thin night wear was not able to hide the beautiful sensations between them.</p>
 <p>"There's no good guys in this world. Even you're like this." Di Chen was not angry but she just chided, feeling embarrassed.</p>
 <p>The next afternoon, a huge flying beast stopped above Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p>Five-headed Golden Eagle!</p>
 <p>The Golden Eagle was about a hundred meters in size and a glittery gold. What was weird was that it had five glittery gold heads. It was a Five Fate Golden Eagle. A demonic beast's head usually represented how many lives the beast had. The legendary Nine Headed Snake King and Nine Headed Divine Bug were said to each have nine lives.</p>
 <p>However, this wasn't something that was absolute. Ordinary demonic beasts usually had only one head and they would die with just one attack. However, for those with multiple heads, one would need to smash all of them completely. Even if one was still around, the beast would not be killed. And demonic beasts with multiple heads tended to be especially strong and one could only start attacking them from the head. This was also why it was said that the number of heads represented how many lives the beast had. If a person had the absolute power to crush them all in one go, then the beast would have only just one life.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stumped. Di Chen's master should have left her for quite a while. Was her cultivation not strong enough to bring Di Chen back to Di Clan? Or was it because Di Chen must find a guy she likes to bring her back?</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm heading off!"</p>
 <p>Many people from Qing Clan came out. They all knew that Di Chen had to leave temporarily.</p>
