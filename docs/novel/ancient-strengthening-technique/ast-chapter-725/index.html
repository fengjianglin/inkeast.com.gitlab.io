 <p><strong>AST 725 - Avoiding the clan? Zuoshi Clan, Seeing Yiye Jiange </strong></p>
 <p>It was quiet in the room, Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue’s bodies were still tightly entwined together. Canghai Mingyue used Qing Shui’s arm as a pillow and looked at Qing Shui with a smile that did not seem like a smile.</p>
 <p>“Are you satisfied yet?” Qing Shui smiled while he moved.</p>
 <p>“You naughty thing!” Canghai Mingyue uttered that phrase as she buried her face in Qing Shui’s arms.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he touched those firm and full things, he played with them slowly, they were incredibly smooth, it seemed like they were going to slip away from him, he could not control himself and buried his face in them.</p>
 <p>After being affectionate for a while, Qing Shui got out of bed. Canghai Mingyue also got up to check on the two little ones, Qing Shui went to check them out with her, seeing the two of them sleep so soundly, he went out after he kissed Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>Morning practice, Qing Shui intended to change the time he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to the day time, splitting it into two or three sessions. Because Qing Shui knew that he would no longer have time at night to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui arrived at the ‘dueling grounds’ out back, he discovered that Mingyue Gelou was already there cultivating. She was still cultivating the Tiger Form, her stage was actually the same as Qing Shui’s, it was not inferior to his at all, it exceeded the Great Perfection Stage.</p>
 <p>When her beautiful figure struck out with the Tiger Form, it seemed sharp, her footsteps were graceful and powerful, it emphasized agility and speed, each strike seemed like a sneak attack.</p>
 <p>The abilities of an early Martial Saint, Mingyue Gelou had cultivated the Tiger Form till she reached the abilities of an early Martial Saint. Of course, it was related to her constitution but her perseverance and willpower were the most important factors.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not interrupt her, he even stood slightly further away as he faced the east and begin his daily practice of Taichi Fist and Back Connecting Fist.</p>
 <p>Very soon, Qing Bei, Huoyun Liu-Li, Qing He, Qing You and the others came out and came here, everyone had their own spot that they were used to.</p>
 <p>Only Huoyun Liu-Li stood nearby Qing Shui but she did not interrupt Qing Shui’s cultivation.She only looked at Qing Shui occasionally, then she would continue to cultivate.</p>
 <p>This ‘dueling ground’ was actually an open-air cultivating ground, it had always been the Qing Clan’s cultivating grounds, they normally used it in the morning, other than that, they had their own secret cultivating grounds.</p>
 <p>When it was almost late morning, Qing Shui stopped. The other people went to freshen up and prepare to eat breakfast, Huoyun Liu-Li stood at the side waiting for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped when he saw Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and walked over: “Liu-Li, waiting for me?”</p>
 <p>“Why? Not satisfied?” Huoyun Liu-Li pouted as she hugged Qing Shui’s arm, her long eyelashes gave off a faint foxy feel, it was especially charming.</p>
 <p>“Stop teasing me, if you keep going, then I will eat you up.” Qing Shui stretched his hands out and slapped that plump butt without any warning.</p>
 <p>“I’m not afraid!” Huoyun Liu-Li blushed but she continues to look at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“It was said that the sexual appetite of a woman increases as she grows older, go have some food first and leave the door unlocked for me tonight.” Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue spent an enjoyable night together last night, so he still could resist it or else, he would have eaten her before he had breakfast.</p>
 <p>“What are you saying, I’m not leaving the door unlocked for you.” Huoyun Liu-Li blushed even more, her womanly instincts caused her to be annoyed at Qing Shui’s words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had something to do in the morning, he spent some time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal before telling the clan to fetch Yiye Jiange and not to wait for him for lunch.</p>
 <p>When he left the Qing Clan, he rode on the Fire Bird and flew towards the Heavenly Palace, what used to take half a day could be completed in no time.</p>
 <p>He had not come to the Heavenly Palace for a long time, it felt strange coming here again. He was the patriarch of Heavenly Palace, the youngest patriarch ever, he was the pillar of support for hundreds of thousands of people in the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p>Regardless whoever saw Qing Shui, they would look at him with a respectful gaze. Although two years had passed by, there was no one here that would forget Qing Shui. As for newcomers, they only recruited once every ten years, there were limited places. Unless they were the disciples of a clan in the Heavenly Palace or someone had the recommendation of an elder, they could not join the Heavenly Palace anytime they wanted. Furthermore, they had to be at least a Xiantian and have a clean background.</p>
 <p>He directly flew to the hall where Elder Ge resided. Elder Ge was already waiting there, when he saw Qing Shui, he was especially happy.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ge!” Qing Shui smiled at he greeted him.</p>
 <p>“When did you get back?” Elder Ge happily asked.</p>
 <p>“I arrived at my clan yesterday.”</p>
 <p>The two of them entered the hall, after some conventional greetings were exchanged, they talked about the matters of the Heavenly Palace and what had happened in the past years. However, Elder Ge just frowned, he hesitated for a while before deciding not to say anything.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ge, do you have something that you wanted to say?” Qing Shui smiled as he drank some tea and helped Elder Ge to refill his cup.</p>
 <p>“The Zuoshi clan of the Pingyang County came by earlier looking for you but you weren’t around, they said they would be back later.” Elder Ge looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Pingyang County? Zuoshi Clan?” Qing Shui did not have any impression of them, he looked suspiciously at Elder Ge.</p>
 <p>“Although the Pingyang County was not high profiled and the Zuoshi Clan was not particularly famous but the legends said that the Zuoshi Clan of the Pingyang County was a branch of a hidden clan.” Elder Ge frowned.</p>
 <p>“Hidden clan?” Although this was the first time he truly heard about it, Qing Shui was no stranger to it. The super clans and super sects were normally the true powers of a continent. On the surface, the Greencloud Continent did not have any super-sect or super clan, the Heavenly Palace did not count but there were a few super clans that withdrew from world affairs, they were known as hidden clans.</p>
 <p>“Right, the news is very reliable, they did not used to be here in the Greencloud Continent but they moved in three months ago, they even made some moves.” Elder Ge said worriedly.</p>
 <p>“You are worried that they will be detrimental to the Heavenly Palace?” Qing Shui looked at Elder Ge and asked.</p>
 <p>“A little, according to their movements, I believe that they want to dominate the Greencloud Continent, to become the strongest presence in the Greencloud Continent.” Elder Ge said after he thought a while.</p>
 <p>It was normal to worry like that when they were in a high position. When Qing Shui left this time, he had destroyed quite a few powers, thus he was not worried about this.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ge, in the past, the Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower were equals, there were even a few powers that had a similar power to Heavenly. In the end, the Heavenly Palace managed to climb the highest. However, this was a false reputation, and it caused trouble for them. Even so, in order to have this position, one had to have strength first.” Qing Shui looked at Elder Ge with a smile.</p>
 <p>Elder Ge looked at Qing Shui and laughed: “Good, I never expected that you would able to see through this earlier than me. If the Heavenly Palace did not have the abilities, then we might as well as give up this false reputation. It was more important to survive, the inheritance of the sect comes first. The number of people who can make this rational reasoning were very few.”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, those who wants to have it, they can provided that they are stronger than us. If they were here to make trouble on purpose, the Heavenly Palace is not afraid of anyone.”</p>
 <p>Elder Ge looked at Qing Shui, although he could not see through Qing Shui’s abilities, he could feel the changes of Qing Shui, his aura had changed. He knew that Qing Shui’s abilities had made a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>The two of them drank tea as they chatted for an hour, Elder Ge laughed and said: “Jiange is here, since you are back, go see her.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and took his leave, he then headed to a mountain peak a little distance away, it was not that far away from the back mountains. He thought about the girl from the Feng Clan and Gongsun Jianwu.</p>
 <p>He then shook head and headed up to the peak, although this place was not big, it was very quiet.</p>
 <p>There was a series of stone steps winding up the mountain, it was about 30 meters high, this kind of height could be easily ignored.</p>
 <p>When he went up, he found that it was a relaxing place, there were many tall and sturdy trees, causing this mountain peak to feel very tall and straight. His gaze noticed that a tall and slender woman practicing the Tiger Form.</p>
 <p>Feeling Qing Shui’s gaze, the woman turned her body, to reveal an exquisite face. She was stunned for a while before rapidly rushing over to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he hugged Luan Luan who ran over, now she was eighteen years old and was only half a head shorter than Qing Shui, she looked very similar to Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“Young lass, you have grown so tall already.” Qing Shui smiled as he rubbed Luan Luan’s head.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I missed you, the next time you leave, you have to bring me along.” Luan Luan hugged Qing Shui’s neck as she pouted.</p>
 <p>“I also missed my little girl.” Qing Shui rubbed her head vigorously.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, be gentler, you are going to turn me stupid.” Luan Luan happily said, she loved having these parental interactions with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Where’s your mother?” Qing Shui smiled as he asked Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>“Probably in her room!”</p>
 <p>Luan Luan said as she pulled Qing Shui towards the pavilion behind, this pavilion was two-storied and was made of firm green stones, its external appearance like plain and simple.</p>
 <p>After they arrived, they went to the second floor, the decorations in there were simple and exquisite. The color of the room was snow-white, it looked incredibly pure and clean. The first floor had a living room and a bedroom but most people would prefer to stay on the second or third floor. However, there were only two stories.</p>
 <p>“Mother, look who’s here.” Luan Luan shouted when she entered the room.</p>
 <p>There was also a small living room on the second floor, surrounding the living room were rooms. It looked very cozy and warm, the originally large room looked smaller.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was wearing a plain white shirt as she laid on the couch reading a book. When she heard Luan Luan shout, she raised her head and took a look. Coincidentally, she met Qing Shui’s gaze.</p>
 <p>“Jiange!”</p>
 <p>When Luan Luan was present, Qing Shui would address Yiye Jiange as such!</p>
 <p>“You have returned!”Yiye Jiange smiled, her tone clearly showed her surprise.</p>
 <p>“Mn!”</p>
 <p>“Father, hug mother, don’t you miss her?” Luan Luan said happily at the side.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pinched Luan Luan’s straight nose before walking over slowly and giving Yiye Jiange a warm hug. This was not the first time they hugged because of Luan Luan, it was just a hug.</p>
 <p>“I missed you guys.” Qing Shui smiled as he whispered into Yiye Jiange’s ear.</p>
 <p>“We missed you too.” Yiye Jiange seemed a little red as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan already left quietly. She gave Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange some time alone, she did not know the true relationship between the three of them.</p>
 <p>After Luan Luan left, the two of them seemed to sigh in relief before slowly letting go of each other’s hands.</p>
