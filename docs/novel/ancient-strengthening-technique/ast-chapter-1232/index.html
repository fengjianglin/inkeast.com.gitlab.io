 <p><strong>AST 1232 - Formidable demonic beast, Breakthrough, Seven-headed Demonic Spider</strong></p>
 <p>Even though the battle techniques of the Fire Bird hardly got enhanced, compared to before, the change was still quite significant. Not only had the strength of the Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens increased, it had also become a passive battle technique.</p>
 <p>Despite the fact that active battle techniques were powerful, passive battle techniques still played an inevitable role for powerful demonic beasts. In actuality, the one which was truly formidable would still be the passive battle techniques. For example, the Dark Phoenix and Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens alone already helped increase the strength of the Fire Bird by more than ten fold.</p>
 <p>Under the effect of Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens, the strength of the Fire Bird managed to achieve roughly ninety thousand nimbus. With the additional aid provided by the Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens, the strength of the Fire Bird got further increased to almost a strength which was worth around five hundred thousand nimbus.</p>
 <p>For now, it still couldn’t be compared to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. But this was perfectly normal, after all, the Nirvanic Fruit had still yet to be consumed. Even now, the strength of the Fire Bird was already incomparably terrifying. Unfortunately, it didn’t manage to go through bloodline awakening.</p>
 <p>As for the Nirvanic Fruit, Qing Shui decided to leave it for now. He was confident that the Fire Bird would seize its own opportunity. However, he had already communicated with the Fire Bird through his mind that it could call for Qing Shui if it needed any help while consuming the Nirvanic Fruit.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird hadn’t really grown in size either. Basically, it looked almost the same as before. It was just that the entire demeanor around it had changed. The aura which it emitted had also gotten a lot stronger. That was a kind of ferocious avian-type beast aura.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt quite satisfied with the Fire Bird’s current strength. It has been quite a long time since this very demonic beast with decent lineage last engaged in battles. It might not be long until it was once again able to involve itself in battles.</p>
 <p>Half a day passed. It wasn’t really considered long. Qing Shui looked and noticed that there was still Ancient Demonic Fruit left. He had only used one. Despite this, a demonic beast was also only able to consume one of them every hundred years. Hence, he left behind another nine for his other demonic beasts. In any case, he still needed to prepare a few more for Luan Luan and the others.</p>
 <p>It took a long time for these things to grow, even longer than the Mysterious Fruit. However, it was very likely that only someone like him who had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would be able to draw out the effects of these kinds of Heavenly And Earthly Treasures.</p>
 <p>For example, the enormous lotus in the pond and the Flower of Life which was soon going to blossom with its seventh flower. All of these helped make the medicinal herbs in the surroundings increase their years by nearly one fold.</p>
 <p>During this time, Qing Shui also didn’t use it. The Flower of Life was giving off abundant life force. Qing Shui purposely left them to help increase Luan Luan’s lifespan. Now that he had Qing Sha, letting the Flower of Life blossom with its ninth flower within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal should no longer pose a problem for him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Thunderous Beast. Recently, the one which had been taking part in battles was none other than the Thunderous Beast. The effect of Thunderbolt and Violet Lightning Strike were very useful. The Violet Lightning Strike in particular, at the right time was able to instantly cripple its enemies.</p>
 <p>Legend has it that the Thunderous Beast was also a divine beast which could evolve. Unfortunately, this was only a legend. However, it was undeniable that the Thunderous Beast was very powerful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made the Thunderous Beast swallow the Spring of Life and the Ancient Demonic Fruit after it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was just as excited for the progress of the Thunderous Beast as he was for both the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Fire Bird. At the moment when he saw violet colored lightning enveloping the body of the Thunderous Beast and the surroundings were caught up in a sea of thunder net, he took a deep breath.</p>
 <p>The thunder net was a lot smaller compared to the one he ran into in the ancient ruins. Nevertheless, it was still a spectacular scene. At the moment when Qing Shui felt the Thunderous Beast’s strength increased significantly with his Spiritual Sense, he knew that it had succeeded.</p>
 <p>As the lightning dispersed, Qing Shui saw an entirely new Thunderous Beast. It was steaming with purple aura. When one looked at it carefully, veined patterns of lightning could be vaguely seen across its body, generating an unusually strong visual impact.</p>
 <p>Its physical strength was now worth around ten thousand nimbus.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know why it was slightly higher than the Fire Bird. Could it be that instead of increasing by a fixed amount of strength, the power offered by the Ancient Demonic Fruit was somehow related to the consumer itself.</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui was unable to figure it out, he stopped thinking. In any case, it was better if it could help increase more rather than the opposite.</p>
 <p>Violet Thunder Protection: Unique ability owned by the Thunderous Beast. Increase all of its physical ability by twelve fold. Zero consumption and it revolves on its own. When it was damaged by physical attacks, there was a fixed chance it would paralyze the opponents. Simultaneously, it could help weaken all the attacks of the opponents by 20%.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt: An attack released through the core which contained the power of thunder and lightning. The strength of the attack is three times the user’s physical strength. Distance must not be further than two thousand meters. The attack has a slight paralyzing effect. It can help slow down the speed and reaction time of the enemies. Its effects can be stacked as well. Thunderbolt consumes one tenth of the energy consumed by normal attacks.</p>
 <p>Its distance had once again been increased by quite a lot. These were the special abilities possessed by control type demonic beasts. What Qing Shui was the happiest about was that the Thunderbolt attack finally got it as well. In the past, the damage dealt by thunderbolt had always been the same as the user’s physical strength. Now, the strength of the thunderbolt attack was three times that of the strength of the user. Furthermore, the Thunderbolt consumed very little energy.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike: the user condenses its powerful Core Force together and releases a powerful lightning attack towards the opponents, forming an attack which is five times that of the user’s own strength. It has a 100% chance of paralyzing the opponents. The duration the opponent stay paralyzed depends on their strength. It could be used six times every 12 hours.</p>
 <p>The attack capability of the Violet Lightning Strike had increased. It had gone from the original four fold attack up to five fold. As for the duration of the attack, it was also a lot longer now compared to before.</p>
 <p>Lightning Recovery: since young, the Thunderous Beast has been growing up within the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus. It has an extremely powerful self-recovery ability. By using the Lightning Recovery, it can instantly cure 70% of the damage dealt to itself. The speed at which its wounds recover\ is ten times normal. Effect lasts for an hour. Once it is used, it needs to wait for two hours in order to use it again.</p>
 <p>As for this one, it stayed the same as before. However, Qing Shui didn’t have much opinion towards it. It was already a heaven-defying ability to begin with, even he himself would find it hard to accept if it was to be upgraded yet again.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Armor: Passive battle technique, zero consumption. A battle armor condensed from violet lightning. It can help nullify damage caused by both physical and spirit energy attacks up to 50%.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast was considered a control type beast. Hence, it would first need to confirm its ability to survive on its own. The Violet Lightning Armor was already considered to be extremely heaven-defying. Adding it to the 20% damage reduction provided by the Violet Thunder Protection, the beast would have been able to nullify more than half of the damage caused by its opponents.</p>
 <p>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning: Unleash the powerful Violet Thunder Chain Lightning to attack an area. There was a fixed chance of paralyzing the opponents. The strength of the attack was two times that of normal attacks.</p>
 <p>This had also been slightly upgraded!</p>
 <p>Thunder Flash: Passive battle technique, permanently increase speed by eight fold.</p>
 <p>Speed guaranteed the survival ability of control type demonic beasts. Qing Shui was really happy.</p>
 <p>Mutual Destruction: Deal 80% to the user in exchange for 80% of damage to the opponents. The damage dealt was similar. In other words, the user would attack its opponents with terrifying attacks with both sides ending up injured. Mutual Destruction wouldn’t instantly kill the target.</p>
 <p>It could only be used once a month! The success rate was relatively low when there was a huge gap between the strength of the user and the opponent.</p>
 <p>This still hadn’t changed.</p>
 <p>It stayed the same. Qing Shui continued reading down and noticed a new battle technique.</p>
 <p>Rage of Thunder: Passive battle technique, zero consumption, could once again raise the strength of both the Thunderbolt and Violet Lightning Strike by one fold.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. The improvement shown by the Thunderous Beast this time was considered quite decent. Not only was it resistant to attacks, there was also nothing to complain about its speed even though for now, the attack prowess of the Thunderbolt attack only managed to achieve nearly eight hundred thousand nimbus even after including the effect of the Rage of Thunder to double its attack prowess. The Violet Lightning Strike on the other hand, was now worth 1.3 million nimbus. It was just that there was a limitation while using it. It could only be used six times every twelve hours. If he planned to use it frequently, he would need to summon back the Thunderous Beast into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for a short period of time before letting it out again. However, the consumption brought about by the Violet Lightning Strike was huge.</p>
 <p>The Violet Lightning Strike was considered a killer move. Normally, he would still require the Thunderbolt to tire out his opponents. It had speed and long-range as well as powerful resistance to attacks.</p>
 <p>The Violet Lightning Armor was also a passive battle technique. A passive battle technique was an inherited ability. It was also an Innate Bloodline Battle Technique. This was also why the Thunderous Beast was a frightening being. It could neglect more than half of the damage dealt by the opponent’s attacks, which was truly terrifying.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast wasn’t like Fire Bird. In the future, the Fire Bird would still have the Nirvanic Fruit. The Thunderous Beast on the other hand, had to rely on itself to increase its strength. But for now, it was already considered to possess decent strength. Even when it was up against an opponent more powerful than itself, it was unlikely that the Thunderous Beast would be tired to death.</p>
 <p>Aside from that, Qing Shui was now unsure about the effect of Spirit Gathering Lamp. It would have been great if it was effective.</p>
 <p>Moving on, it was now the Six-headed Demonic Spider’s turn. From Qing Shui’s perspective, the Six-headed Demonic Spider had the highest intellect compared to the rest of his demonic beasts. Qing Shui even started having the feeling that the spider was like a half-grown child.</p>
 <p>As time passed, its voice had now begun to sound like the voice of a half-grown girl. Unknowingly, it had begun to sound less metallic. Instead, it was more like the voice of a human now. Nevertheless, it was still only able to communicate with Qing Shui through its mind.</p>
 <p>Based on Qing Shui’s knowledge, he had already begun to treat her like a human. Whenever he was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would even talk to her through his consciousness. It was just that she knew very few things. But compared to the demonic beasts here, she was still already considered to possess a lot of knowledge. According to her, she had inhereditary memories and knew about those knowledge since she was born.</p>
 <p>The things which she knew consisted of Roc, Dragon Eagle, Dragon Phoenix, Giant Devil Statue and more. All of these made Qing Shui feel really shocked. To think that there was information about all of these within her inherited memory. This meant that powerful blood flowed within her bloodline.</p>
 <p>Similarly, the Six-headed Demonic Spider belonged to the control type demonic beasts. Furthermore, Qing Shui had a feeling that it would turn out to be very powerful in the future.</p>
 <p>At the moment when light emerged from the Six-headed Demonic Spider’s body, adding on the Thousand Years Gloomy Fruit which it has been eating in the past, it managed to significantly increase its strength. And now, it had even managed to undergo an enormous breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Its metal-like body gave out a cold and bright light.</p>
 <p>Si-si……</p>
 <p>The loud noises sounded like the neighing of horses. It was unusually ear-piercing. Following that, Qing Shui noticed an additional head had grown out in between the two heads which were originally already there. The one at the most center was a gold head. Contrary to one’s expectations, it looked a bit beautiful this way.</p>
 <p>Below its gold main head, there was one head each on both sides of it respectively.</p>
 <p>Seven-headed Demonic Spider!</p>
 <p>It broke through……</p>
 <p>To the Six-headed Demonic Spider, every time it grew out an additional head would mean that it broke through. Each of its breakthroughs meant a qualitative change in the demonic spider itself.</p>
 <p>The Seven-headed Demonic Spider had now gotten a lot bigger than before. It was just like a small mountain top. Qing Shui tried to sense the strength of the Seven-headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>Physical strength which was worth fifteen thousand nimbus…..</p>
 <p>From this, Qing Shui was able to conclude that the amount of strength which the Ancient Demonic Fruit increased wasn’t fixed. The reason why the Seven-headed Demonic Spider managed to increase so much of its strength might have had to do with the last time it broke through.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately proceeded to look at the abilities of the Seven-headed Demonic Spider. Normally, the number seven marked a huge line of demarcation from the past levels. Hence, Qing Shui was really excited for it.</p>
 <p>Five Qi Origin: The Innate Skills of the Five-headed Demonic Spider. Permanently increases its physical strength by fourteen fold. Zero consumption.</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web: the Five-headed Demonic Spider can unleash an inescapable net attack. The attack contains a powerful corrosive poison and high viscosity. The spider thread is so tough that it is hard to cut with even swords and knives. The damage caused by the poisonous web is three times the damage dealt by the user.</p>
 <p>Poison Silk Entanglement: the Five-headed Demonic Spider is able to release a poisonous thread and unleash its attack within around two thousand meters of distance. It is capable of spiralling itself around its opponent and has superb speed. The stickiness as well as toxicity of the thread is even more powerful. The strength of the attack is five times the physical strength of the user.</p>
 <p>Spider Swarm Attack: A unique ability owned only by King-level Demonic Beast. It has powerful underlings around it. They can coordinate with its attacks.</p>
 <p>Flying Spider Silk: Passive battle technique, zero consumption, permanently increase speed by eight fold.</p>
 <p>Sharpness: All eight legs of the Five-headed Demonic Spider are incomparably sharp. It also contains an extremely powerful toxicity and penetrating effect.</p>
 <p>Unyielding Shield: The defensive strength of the Five-headed Demonic Spider was extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>Demonic Spider Golden Armor: Increase the body toughness and sharpness and the toughness, stickiness and toxicity of the spider thread of the Five-headed Demonic Spider three fold. It also increases its endurance by one fold. Zero consumption.</p>
 <p>Now, it once again had more passive battle techniques. Its strength had gone through an earth-shaking change.</p>
