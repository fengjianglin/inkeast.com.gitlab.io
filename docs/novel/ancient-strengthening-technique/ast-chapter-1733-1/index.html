 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng noticed Xuan She’s expression. He remained calm and chose to ignore that face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the entrance to the Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path. However, it was yet to be the opening time so people rushed here one after another. It was still early when the Xu Clan arrived. Hence, there was no one else around where they stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, it was the same for all of the great forces. The ordinary small forces wouldn’t take initiatives to approach them. After all, they were here to fight over the treasure. When you were inferior to the opponents, you would end up being looked down upon or being remembered. It was not a good thing to be remembered in such a way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, Qing Shui saw the Wavemoon Cavern which came with roughly more than 20 men. Qing Shui also got a glance of Huang Wu and apparently got noticed instantly as well, now that Qing Shui and Shui Yunfeng were together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, the two ladies standing near to Qing Shui became the center of focus. Sunset Palace Mistress and Muyun Qingge. One from the Drakainas, one from the Mermaids. Many people threw their eyes over here and wondered who these two remarkable beauties belonged to. They got their answer when they looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Wu was stunned the moment he saw Qing Shui but he was back to normal immediately. He nodded to Qing Shui and didn’t come forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded lightly as well. He didn’t take it seriously. The chief of Wavemoon Cavern was a man who appeared older than Shui Yunfeng and Xuan She. The yellow robe couldn’t conceal his gloomy and cold aura. Standing there, smiling, this man seemed extremely peculiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, Shui Yunfeng pointed out other forces to Qing Shui. Though they were not as strong as the Wavemoon Cavern and Xu Clan, they were still huge forces within this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui listened attentively and remembered them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short while, Shui Yunfeng gazed at a distance far away, looking astonished. Qing Shui was curious and then followed Shui Yunfeng’s line of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From a distant place, about ten shadows emerged, riding an enormous fish which was a hundred meters long, sparkling gold, and full of spiritual sense. It appeared extraordinarily lofty and majestic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden Scaled Fish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s eyes became brightened. To his surprise, it was the Golden Scaled Fish! It was the Ancient Mutant species, the Golden Scale in the ancient days. The Golden Scale was an enormous beast which was powerful in not only the ocean, lands but also in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Scaled Fish was only a fish species from the Golden Scale bloodline. In fact, a lot of demonic beasts had the Golden Scale bloodline. However, the Golden Scaled Fish had a higher inheritance from the Golden Scale among the rest. Even their appearances were similar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">About ten men rode on top. Qing Shui was amazed that these men were outstandingly good-looking. Qing Shui also felt that something was weird about them. Soon, he knew who these men were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ocean Demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were from the Ocean Demon Palace. Qing Shui’s eyes lit up. The Ocean Demon was an ancient tribe with a long history. Of those who had come here, the Ocean Demon ranked first for its historical inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ocean Demons didn’t have primitive states. They had the human looks just like the Mermaids and the Drakainas. They would only exhibit some tribe traits under certain circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mermaids would have their legs transformed into huge fishtails to achieve the fastest speed in the water. This was the biggest trait to differentiate them from humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Drakainas didn’t have obvious traits except for their hands which would turn into dragon claws. This didn’t seem like their own traits but more like a technique they practiced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ocean Demon before him was one of these tribes. Their unique trait was the spirit-like feeling they gave out and their faint wispy existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The men and women of the Ocean Demon tribe were exceptionally good-looking. Not even one of them looked below average, each of them was gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, there were many types of Ocean Demons. Yet, only the ones here were the genuine Ocean Demons. Some of the Ocean Demons were like monsters. They were not the real ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ocean Demon Palace was far away, further than anyone who had come here. The current Ocean Demon were legends who could hardly be seen. Hence, nobody recognized them here, neither did they recognize anyone here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Chief Ocean Demon stood stout and straight. The Chief could be confirmed to be a man from his robust face. Qing Shui concluded his gender from the masculine aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ambiance was extensive and strong. His eyes were deep yet bright. His attractiveness was beyond description. Even Qing Shui thought that this man was an eye candy. It was best to describe him using the word “beautiful”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Qing Shui’s view, it was definitely better to be a tougher-looking man. He himself looked pretty, even a bit devilish and feminine. Fortunately, his manly side was not depleted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui noticed three female Ocean Demons at the back. They were absolutely alluring with exaggerated curves which made people nosebleed. Nevertheless, they had pretty and fresh-looking faces, occasionally giving out lovely charms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lot of men here were captivated since this was the first time they had seen the Ocean Demons. They were full of curiosities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the wandering sights, the Chief Ocean Demon raised his eyebrow and glared at the crowd which was having roaming imaginations. Many of them shivered and stopped staring heavy-heartedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment this man saw the two Mistresses beside Qing Shui, his eye brightened up and he stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sighed in disbelief. The man must have found out their identities. The Drakainas and Mermaids were of royal existence in the entire world of ocean domain. They were honorable. Although the respectability came from their bloodline, they would still be respected even if they were to be fallen one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching the male Ocean Demon who came forward, Qing Shui stood still. The two Mistresses also noticed the Ocean Demon walking towards them, their face didn’t change a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, ladies. I am Yan Ziyun. It’s my pleasure to know both of you.” Said the male Ocean Demon in a casual manner to Sunset Palace Mistress and Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know you, and I don’t want to know you.” Sunset Palace Mistress said seriously with a frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Ziyun was surprised. He was the young Lord of Ocean Demon Palace, the most honorable and had powerful strength. Regardless of seniors or juniors, his status was special. He was brought up to rule and manage the Ocean Demon Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was straightforward. She didn’t even look at the male Ocean Demon and shamelessly walked to the back corner so that she could hide behind Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the male Ocean Demon said, Yan Ziyun should be his actual name, unlike Shui Yunfeng who used the title ‘Chi Yan’ on the outside while hiding his real name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Ziyun examined Qing Shui seriously.
