 <p><strong>Chapter 368 Meeting Shi Qingzhuang again.</strong></p>

  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 368 - Meeting Shi Qingzhuang Again</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I wonder if I can further upgrade the Big Dipper Sword again after my forging techniques leveled up in the future.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped thinking about that after a while. He was already very satisfied now. In any case, another beaming smile appeared on his face when he thought of the Tiger Stones he had bought. It was too valuable, and Qing Shui could also feel that the Tiger Stones definitely had something to do with forging.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided that he must surely visit the White Tiger Ridge in the future. With his spatial realm, there was no need to worry about lack of space when it came to storing stuff. He would definitely mine all the stones there and store it securely for his future usage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui would enter his spatial realm twice every day, with each visit lasting about 16 days. He used this time to perfect his control over the Seven Stars Armored Vest’s essence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he was relaxing, he would ponder over the cooking recipes and methods of making medicinal soups such as the Tiger Bone Soup, Snake Bladder Soup, Bear Gall Soup…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During the next day when Qing Shui was going to practice his daily morning routine in the Qing Clan’s court yard, he discovered Qing He was already there. Not only that, there were several members of the Qing Clan surrounding him with wide smiles on all their faces.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The third generation members were especially excited as all of them unceasingly asked questions, asking how had Qing He broken through to Xiantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing He, after his breakthrough, looked much younger compared to before. His entire being radiated a youthful energy as well as the confidence of an expert.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Congratulations to Second Uncle!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled at Qing He.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, this was all thanks to you.” Qing He happily replied while laughing uproariously. He was in an extremely good mood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nonsense, this has a lot to do with Second Uncle’s own capabilities as well. Don’t mention thanks in front of me, we are one family.” Qing Shui laughed heartily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The gazes of the members of the Qing Clan were burning with excitement as they looked at Qing Shui. All of them also aspired to breakthrough to Xiantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, none among them could feel the change in Qing Shui. The current level of power Qing Shui had was no longer something people like them would be able to discern.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taichi Fist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Half a year ago, ever since his return to the Qing Clan, Qing Shui would practice the Taichi Fist every morning, facing the rising morning sun and cultivating his nature energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since he had obtained nature energy, Qing Shui already told himself that he had to practice Taichi to its extreme limits. The miraculous energy, nature energy, was something that one could only hope to meet but not actively sought after. Since he had the destiny to obtain it, he might as well walk this path all the way till the end.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The other members of Qing Clan couldn’t possibly be like Qing Shui, spending all their time practicing the Taichi Fist everyday. Only Mingyue Gelou would emulate Qing Shui, following him in his daily morning practice routine.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What made Qing Shui astonished was that Mingyue Gelou only used half a year of time to reach the Ancestor Realm in Taichi Fist. This kind of speed was extremely terrifying, especially considering the fact that Mingyue Gelou was unlike him. She didn’t have the aid of the Violet Jade Immortal Realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Comprehension was the most important. Sometimes, hard work and effort was insufficient to reach the pinnacle. Only with sufficient comprehension would one be able to tap into 100% of their natural talent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, 100% talent equals to nothing without 99% of hardwork!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, it was time for lunch. Ever since Qing Shui was back, happy smiles of joyful contentment filled the face of every member in the Qing Clan as they gathered together, making merry and enjoying their meals.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The clan that was in most topic of discussion in the Hundred Miles City were undoubtedly the Qing Clan. The Qing Clan was also the clan that garnered the most attention, and recently, there had been many parties seeking marriage engagement, hoping to enter into an alliance with the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With regards to these people, Qing Shui was filled with disdain. However, he could understand that currying favor with others was natural for the majority of weaker people, hence, he could tolerate them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yesterday when he made his way to the Shi Clan, he was stopped by Xiang Bao halfway, therefore he decided to go there earlier today.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sun was still in the eastern position, and it was already the summer. The heat of the summer sun caused many young girls on the street to dress more simply, revealing their jade-like legs and sleeveless snow white arms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Nine Continents wasn’t a feudal system.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The status of women weren’t lower than that of men. Although powerful men were in more abundance compared to women, there were many powerful women as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Palace Mistress of the Misty Halls in the Heavenly Palace was one of them, the owners of Earthly Paradise - Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue could be considered another. Even his goddess master, Yiye Jiange and Zhu Qing from the Skysword Sect was one as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui knew that he loved women with strong personalities, he didn’t discover that among the women he really knew, all of them had strong personalities.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As the saying goes, powerful men loved meek women that followed their every wishes. Qing Shui had to agreed with this. An example of what he loved most was the holy woman Canghai Mingyue descending to mortality, behaving like a little woman in front of him, as well as ice princess Shi Qingzhuang, melting her ice heart and opening up to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This realization caused Qing Shui to be slightly stunned. He was shocked by it. Did he like conquering them?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Conquering women? Conquering desire?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head as he thought of that. He was really in love with them, but not because of the satisfaction other men would feel when beautiful women submitted to them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He then thought of the gentleness of Zhu Qing and the charm of Huoyun Liu-Li...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui discovered that his mind was in chaos because he couldn’t find anything to say. It seemed like love was not dictated by reason.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui didn’t dare to be so sure to proclaim that he would never ever love a loli ….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he arrived at the crossroads, Qing Shui remembered that he once met Mo Yan here. Looking at the clinic, he sighed knowing that although the place remained the same, the essence of the place had already change. The doctor in the clinic was replaced by a middle aged man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Where was her origins, why would she be in the Hundred Miles City back then and eventually going to the Heavenly Palace?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t make heads or tails out of this despite pondering over it for a long time. In any case, he didn’t feel that Mo Yan’s motives for doing so had anything to do with him. Back then when he stare into her clear eyes, his instinct told him that she was harmless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was sure Mo Yan had some agenda of her own in any case.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He soon arrived at the Shi Clan and discarded his random thoughts. Qing Shui understood this logic perfectly - with sufficient strength, ever obstacle before him shall become as illusory as the drifting clouds. Nothing would be able to obstruct him no matter how he chooses to act.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The guards at the Shi Clan’s gate naturally knew of Qing Shui. They respectfully stood aside, inviting him in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed as he nodded his head, entering the Shi Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just when he was hesitating whether should he go around and greet the elders of the Shi Clan, Shi Qingzhuang’s grandfather appeared. He had a smile on his face when he regarded Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui you’re here! Are you looking for Qingzhuang?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose and greeted, “Hi Grandpa.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, go go go. Don’t waste your time talking to an old man like me.” The grandfather of Shi Qingzhuang laughed as he waved his hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui embarrassedly laughed along. After which, he bid his farewells, walking in the direction of the backyard!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he entered the backyard, Qing Shui halted. Under a grade tree, Shi Qingzhuang was reclining on a chair, appearing to be in a deep sleep. The quiet and tranquil surroundings evoked feelings of artistry in Qing Shui. The beauty of this backyard, along with the beauty of Shi Qingzhuang, was like a celestial paradise.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood there, quietly observing the first woman he loved. Contentment could be seen in his eyes, as he regarded the peace on her face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly moving closer, Qing Shui was dazzled by her beauty. That long lashes of her eyes was filled with an indescribable charm, giving her a hint of sexiness that was akin to flames in a sea of ice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her sleeping posture resembled a work of art. That fiery red dress contrasted splendidly against her ice cold features. Her snow white hands were crossed delicately across her abdomen, as her gentle breathing gave rise to the slight fluctuations of her chest, a wondrous sight to behold.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was his first woman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A woman that Qing Shui would never forget. She was his first experience, as well as the one that allowed Qing Shui to unlock the second level of the Violet Jade Immortal Realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After an unknown amount of time passed, Shi Qingzhuang gradually opened her eyes. Qing Shui stare unblinkingly at that clear limpid eyes of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a moment of being unfocused, her beautiful eyes registered a hint of panic, but it was soon smoothed over by a blissful expression of love.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing the faint hints of a smile in her eyes, Qing Shui felt gratified in his heart. This ice beauty obviously still had him in her heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you here!” Shi Qingzhuang stood up as she smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is there even a need to ask? I’m here to visit my beloved!”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head as he thought of that. He was really in love with them, but not because of the satisfaction other men would feel when beautiful women submitted to them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He then thought of the gentleness of Zhu Qing and the charm of Huoyun Liu-Li...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui discovered that his mind was in chaos because he couldn’t find anything to say. It seemed like love was not dictated by reason.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui didn’t dare to be so sure to proclaim that he would never ever love a loli ….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he arrived at the crossroads, Qing Shui remembered that he once met Mo Yan here. Looking at the clinic, he sighed knowing that although the place remained the same, the essence of the place had already change. The doctor in the clinic was replaced by a middle aged man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Where was her origins, why would she be in the Hundred Miles City back then and eventually going to the Heavenly Palace?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t make heads or tails out of this despite pondering over it for a long time. In any case, he didn’t feel that Mo Yan’s motives for doing so had anything to do with him. Back then when he stare into her clear eyes, his instinct told him that she was harmless.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was sure Mo Yan had some agenda of her own in any case.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He soon arrived at the Shi Clan and discarded his random thoughts. Qing Shui understood this logic perfectly - with sufficient strength, ever obstacle before him shall become as illusory as the drifting clouds. Nothing would be able to obstruct him no matter how he chooses to act.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The guards at the Shi Clan’s gate naturally knew of Qing Shui. They respectfully stood aside, inviting him in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed as he nodded his head, entering the Shi Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just when he was hesitating whether should he go around and greet the elders of the Shi Clan, Shi Qingzhuang’s grandfather appeared. He had a smile on his face when he regarded Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui you’re here! Are you looking for Qingzhuang?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose and greeted, “Hi Grandpa.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, go go go. Don’t waste your time talking to an old man like me.” The grandfather of Shi Qingzhuang laughed as he waved his hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui embarrassedly laughed along. After which, he bid his farewells, walking in the direction of the backyard!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he entered the backyard, Qing Shui halted. Under a grade tree, Shi Qingzhuang was reclining on a chair, appearing to be in a deep sleep. The quiet and tranquil surroundings evoked feelings of artistry in Qing Shui. The beauty of this backyard, along with the beauty of Shi Qingzhuang, was like a celestial paradise.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood there, quietly observing the first woman he loved. Contentment could be seen in his eyes, as he regarded the peace on her face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly moving closer, Qing Shui was dazzled by her beauty. That long lashes of her eyes was filled with an indescribable charm, giving her a hint of sexiness that was akin to flames in a sea of ice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her sleeping posture resembled a work of art. That fiery red dress contrasted splendidly against her ice cold features. Her snow white hands were crossed delicately across her abdomen, as her gentle breathing gave rise to the slight fluctuations of her chest, a wondrous sight to behold.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was his first woman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A woman that Qing Shui would never forget. She was his first experience, as well as the one that allowed Qing Shui to unlock the second level of the Violet Jade Immortal Realm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After an unknown amount of time passed, Shi Qingzhuang gradually opened her eyes. Qing Shui stare unblinkingly at that clear limpid eyes of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a moment of being unfocused, her beautiful eyes registered a hint of panic, but it was soon smoothed over by a blissful expression of love.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing the faint hints of a smile in her eyes, Qing Shui felt gratified in his heart. This ice beauty obviously still had him in her heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you here!” Shi Qingzhuang stood up as she smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is there even a need to ask? I’m here to visit my beloved!”</p>
