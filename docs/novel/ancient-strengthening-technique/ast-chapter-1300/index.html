 <p><strong>AST 1300 - Unleashing the Soul Charming Soft Tendon Hand Technique again</strong></p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was stunned upon seeing Qing Shui. She asked him curiously, “Why didn’t you go to their room? Why did you come to mine?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. “You’re my woman, what’s so weird about me coming here?”</p>
 <p>At the moment when he finished speaking, he grabbed her white arms and began walking into the direction towards the sofa.</p>
 <p>“You can’t really do anything here…” Yiye Jiange said softly. Actually, she was reminding Qing Shui that he couldn’t do anything while they were here.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui was able to interpret her meaning as he smiled. “So, a simple and pure woman who has never gotten herself stained with the filthy mortal world tend to also have this kind of thought in her mind. I am here to talk to you about ambitions. Do you really think that there is nothing else for us to talk about?”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange got grumpy from what Qing Shui said and immediately pinched his cheek. It was not that she was angry, in fact, it somewhat felt good to get bitten back by this little pervert. Naturally, there would be a huge gap between how thick Qing Shui’s face was compared to her.</p>
 <p>A bit of shyness could be spotted on her face. In fact, she seemed to now possess an aura which belonged to that in the mortal world. Qing Shui grabbed her and they sat together shoulder-to-shoulder on the sofa. “If you are not going to take the initiative, I somehow don’t have the courage to defile you. Luckily, you said before that you are going to be my knight. You have to take the initiative……”</p>
 <p>“You are still talking about it. Are you looking for a beating?” Yiye Jiange said, a bit embarrassingly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, I will stop talking about it.”</p>
 <p>“Jiange, when are you leaving tomorrow?” Qing Shui changed the topic and questioned Yiye Jiange. Somehow, he would feel uncomfortable every time he got reminded that she was leaving.</p>
 <p>However, he felt that all the women in the Portraits of Beauty somehow had their own life and destiny. Hence, he wouldn’t try to stop them. He didn’t know how much they would achieve in the future but he was sure that it wouldn’t be ordinary.</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow morning. I will be able to come back early if I leave early. Is it alright for me to marry you when I am back?” Yiye Jiange said gently and smiled.</p>
 <p>Actually, ever since the things concerning the Lion King’s Ridge had ended, she planned to marry Qing Shui but she had never been able to do it. Naturally, Qing Shui also wouldn’t request for her to do so. Despite this, she was aware that she was already considered to be one of his women since a long time ago.</p>
 <p>“Of course. By then, you can be more active. Stay on top of me like you’re being the knight.” Qing Shui said as he blinked his eyes and licked his lips.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was a bit speechless. She flicked his forehead and smiled. “Darling, why don’t we talk about it on our bed!” Qing Shui stood up and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled as she stood up and opened both her arms.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried the embarrassed Yiye Jiange, and made his way towards their bedroom. Even if they were yet to break through all the way to the last stage of their relationship, there were some alternatives which they could still do.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui embraced Yiye Jiange and rolled together with her onto the bed. After that, he began to slowly kiss that beautiful lips of hers as she slightly closed her beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>The soft and fragrant sensation made Qing Shui felt really clear-headed. He sucked her lips, trying to intrude his way little by little into her mouth meticulously. He kissed her eyes, nose, and cheeks before he settled back down on her lips.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange kept her mouth totally shut precisely to prevent Qing Shui from putting his tongue inside. Qing Shui immediately put his hands into her clothes. What shocked Qing Shui was that she was only wearing pajamas and there was no inner wear else inside.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held her well-endowed and plump breasts with both of his hands. In an instant, a numb sensation got transmitted to his arms all the way to his bones. Yiye Jiange unconsciously opened her mouth and Qing Shui took the initiative to put his tongue inside.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hand movements were very slow and meticulous. Slowly, it made Yiye Jiange seemed as if she had finally let loose. She hugged Qing Shui’s neck with both of her arms. The pinkish tongue of hers would, from time to time, respond to Qing Shui’s passion. The pleasurable sensation which he got at that moment was something that couldn’t be described with words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept on kissing her until she wasn’t able to catch her breath. That was when did he finally released her mouth and looked at her beautiful face that was flushed red. Compared to before, her otherworldly aura which was unstained by anything from the mortal world seemed to now bring even more impact.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, remember, you aren’t allowed to do that this time. I will promise you anything when I come back next time.”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange, who was gasping slightly, held up Qing Shui’s face and asked him.</p>
 <p>“You have to remember what you said. Or else, I will definitely give you the most exciting one. Today, we won’t go all out with things, but we can still do other things.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui finished speaking, he started to kiss her pinkish neck and took off her pajamas. Her jade-like body seemed like it was crafted by a god and was placed right in front of Qing Shui. It looked so perfectly white and didn’t seem to have the slightest flaws. Her breasts were as shapely as usual and their size didn’t really get affected just because she was lying down. The two pinkish spots on top of her breasts gave out an alluring kind of attraction. He lowered his head, put one of her nipples in his mouth, and began to suck it……..</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange abruptly thrust her body upwards.</p>
 <p>Her flat stomach, slender waist, well-rounded buttocks, and that jade-like body of hers together made a miraculous masterpiece.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared at her without blinking his eyes even once. After that, he started to touch her sweet smelling shoulders with both of his hands. Little by little, as if his hands had some sort of magic power, every single part of Yiye Jiange’s body that he touched would instantly soften. This was the power of the Soul-Charming Soft Tendon Hand Technique. It made her felt really comfortable and numb at the same time. Actually, this feeling of being comfortable all the way to the core was not in the slightest inferior to having actual intercourse. Of course, it wouldn’t have the kind of visual, physical and spiritual impact which sexual intercourse had.</p>
 <p>Despite how pure and simple Yiye Jiange was, she was unable to resist it. She clenched her teeth tightly to make sure that she wouldn’t make any noise. She realized that she actually enjoyed this feeling quite a lot. Thinking up to this point, her mind already started to get messy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hands moved from her soft breasts to her slender waist before it reached her stomach. After that, he moved his hands to her legs. He carried up her small feet, which were fatally attractive, and began to press on them slowly with his fingers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really admired Yiye Jiange for being able to hold it in, not making any noise. However, slight gasping sounds could be heard coming from her. Qing Shui didn’t have a foot fetish and in his past incarnation, he really hated those perverts. However, right now he was now holding one of Yiye Jiange’s legs. It was just like a piece of jade, it looked really beautiful, white as jade, and it also even emitted a faint fragrance.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui had been in this past incarnation, he wouldn’t believe that there would be such beautiful legs. At this moment, he felt an urge to kiss it and that urge was getting stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>When the tip of his tongue licked past her soft leg, slowly moving to her inner thigh.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange let out a soft moan. It was always been said that the legs were one of the sensitive parts of a human’s body. A lot of people’s legs were sensitive, as there were a lot of acupoints on a person’s leg.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don’t kiss that part, it’s dirty.” Yiye Jiange sounded a bit indolent. Right now, she felt really weak. She didn’t have the energy to resist Qing Shui no matter what he did now.</p>
 <p>“Every part of your body is the purest!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui didn’t go all out with things, it could already be considered as one of the closest interactions a couple could have. Qing Shui only ejaculated after that beautiful, white hand of hers worked hard for almost two hours. He ejaculated a lot on her body. At that instant, her expression, she who had never been stained by the things in the mortal life, looked extremely panicked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged Yiye Jiange and had an affectionate shower with each other. After that did only they lay down on the bed together.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange’s brother and his family were also in the house. Hence, the Qing Clan could now be considered as a huge clan, mainly because they had powerful warriors. If the amount of the clan members were to be taken into account, they could only be considered as a small clan.</p>
 <p>“Jiange, do you have any wish?” Qing Shui didn’t ask her what ambition she had.</p>
 <p>“In the past, my wish used to be to fight for the Yiye Clan’s justice from the Lion King’s Ridge. But now, I feel a bit lost as to what I want.”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange cuddled herself into Qing Shui’s arms. This action from an extreme beauty like her tended to make men felt especially satisfied. It was a kind of satisfaction and blessing which words alone couldn’t describe. It felt even better than getting a reward worth a billion dollars in his previous incarnation.</p>
 <p>She was a simple woman who didn’t have any desire. However, the vengeance she harbored from the past had caused her life to fall into a semi-demise state. Her parents used their life in exchange for the lives of her and her brother to survive. They told them to stay alive instead of thinking of taking revenge.</p>
 <p>However, after their parents died in the hands of the enemies, it was impossible for them to be able to live with the enemies under the same sky. Hence, she had been working hard all the time, those kind of sufferings weren’t something which ordinary people could take. Hence, it could be said that her world in the past used to be only occupied by these vengeful thoughts.</p>
 <p>The first time when Qing Shui suggested that he would help her, he was still a very, very weak man. However, he had actually managed to realize his promise to help her topple over the Lion King’s Ridge within 20 years time.</p>
 <p>It was also because of this that she suddenly realized that she had fallen for this lecherous young man. It might also be because she shared with him her story concerning herself and her family’s vengeance. Back then, other than himself, she would never talk to anyone about her origin as well as her personal enemies.</p>
 <p>She stared at the man who was almost within her reach, he had now matured a lot. He had become a man who could stand on his own. She extended her head and pecked on his lips once. However, this action of hers only provoked a wave of violent kisses. Even her tiny lips were slightly swollen. She felt a bit blessed as she looked at the proud man.</p>
 <p>“I have managed to receive an inheritance while bringing the Crystal Beast this time. It told me that I would also get a part of it. Didn’t you ask what wish I have? You have already occupied yourself for 20 years. The only thing I hope for is to spend the rest of my life accompanying you.” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of whether this is your wish or not, it will turn it to reality. Even if you plan to run away, I won’t let you run away from me. You are the fairy who came from the Moon Palace. I don’t care if I deserved you or not, I will spend my whole life to drag you down to me. You can consider that as me being selfish.” Qing Shui hugged her tightly.</p>
 <p>“In love, there is no such thing as whether two persons are suited for each other. Could it be that you are having this kind of thought?” Yiye Jiange said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“There should only be very few men who wouldn’t feel inferior in front of you. I feel a bit inferior, for a fact……”</p>
 <p>“Really? You still feel inferior after doing all of these to me?”</p>
 <p>“It’s true! Please give me some encouragement!” Qing Shui said gently.</p>
 <p>“Alright, how are you going to motivate me?” Yiye jiange said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You have always said that this part of mine is really strong. I like it a lot.” While speaking, Qing Shui grabbed her hand and put it on the lower part of his body.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange immediately nipped Qing Shui on his chest.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the second day, Yiye Jiange left. Qing Shui didn’t need to send her off. She disappeared along with the Crystal Beast using a unique formation. After she waved at everyone, Yiye Jiange disappeared in the sky above the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know how long this journey of hers was going to take. In the end, he just shook his head.</p>
 <p>Di Qing walked up to Qing Shui’s side. “Sister Jiange is great. I hope that she will come back as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>“Yes. Actually, your sister really misses you.”</p>
 <p>“Then is it alright for me to go there to look for her?” Di Qing asked after she thought for a while.</p>
 <p>“She has gone for her seclusion. You should cultivate nicely here. In the future, if we feel like meeting each other, we will be able to do so in a blink of an eye.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“Of course. Oh yes, tonight, I am going to help you do some Constitution Nurturing to boost your strength. It’s about time it awakens.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Di Qing’s eyes looked really charming as she slightly nodded her head. Qing Shui noticed that he didn’t feel like going away anymore ever since he came back. No wonder people always said that slumbering in the arms of beauties would lead heroes to a tomb. It might have had to do with the fact that he hadn’t been back for a long time and that he planned to make up for it. In any case, they were all still ordinary women.</p>
 <p>During the day, Qing Shui helped cleanse the impurities off on his children for the second time. Qing Ming could be already considered to have gone through that, All his children possessed decent innate talents, very different to himself back then. Hence, the third generations of the Qing Clan had always been envious of the fourth generation. The foundations which they had to build when they were young was totally different compared to these little brats.</p>
