 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not just Qing Shui’s demonic beasts, the demonic beasts of the Mistresses had also achieved massive breakthroughs. Yiye Jiange’s Nine-Headed Crystal Beast, Muyun Qingge’s White Jade Dragon, and Qing Hanye’s Greencloud Titan Ox, to be exact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was taken aback when he first looked at this ox. It was an Ancient Mutated species. In the legends, it had the bloodline of the Divine Beast Azure Ox. This ox appeared bold and powerful, with a gigantic body. Its enormous horns were a hundred times more ferocious than the ones involved in bullfighting in the past life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing tall on green clouds, its skin was green-colored as well and pleasing to the eye. It mastered the wood attribute abilities and had extreme resistance power regarding the Five Elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Jade Dragon belonged to the dragon species. Not only did its strength stabilize, there were subtle changes in its bloodline as well. It had great strength improvement, almost comparable to the Mistresses except for Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lot of things had changed within two months. Qing Shui felt much relaxed now. He owned a lot of demonic beasts and yet, only these few demonic beasts would come in handy for the time being. The others might not be put to good use for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought that it was adequate to have only these select few demonic beasts. He had the powerful output, strong control, and even the life-saving Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. He was afraid of nobody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was wondering if he had any idea of his own limitations. Since his strength had improved and his demonic beasts grew even stronger, he had no fear anymore. Perhaps, there might still be a lot of stronger forces from somewhere unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, he enjoyed the current satisfaction, the satisfaction which came from his probable ignorance. He was feeling good and satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man’s advancement was through constantly alternating dissatisfaction and little contentment. Blind dissatisfaction would upset a man but at the same time, improvement would be hindered if one was always happily contented. Going beyond limit was as bad as falling short. Everything was at its best when it was appropriate. A man shouldn’t have an excessive pursuit of perfection. The beauty only existed when there was deformity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These days, Qing Shui spent his time taking care of his little one longer than usual. He was more than willing to enjoy such a family bliss. Since Yiye Jiange needed to practice her skills, he offered to babysit throughout the day. After all, he didn’t really do day-time training. Instead, he watched the Mistresses train while caring for his child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During his spare time, Qing Shui indulged in painting and drawing. He would paint a portrait of his son almost every day. Unfortunately, it only remained at the current level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He painted his family members as well. Looking at his painting ability, Qing Shui reckoned it would be universally shocking if he owned such skills in the past life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a long time since Qing Shui last visited the Northern Ocean. He only visited the Linhai City once halfway, when Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing were absent. It seemed like they were doing fine in the Demon Lord Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The couple, Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong, were still in the Imperial Cuisine Hall of Linhai city together with Tianyi and the rest. There wasn’t much difference here after Qing Shui left, though Qing Shui’s presence was important and had caused a stir in the old days. Things would fade as time went by. The world wouldn’t end for no one, regardless of how powerful he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong went through training most of the times besides taking care of Yu Niang’s family and maintaining the normal operation of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Qing Shui taught Tianyi a lot of things. Formerly, he was able to be independent and take charge of a section. Now, he was a model of the Miraculous Physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a simple yet fulfilling lifestyle lately for Qing Shui. However, he also had various feelings because he had been away from his family and women most of the times. He missed them so much that he felt a bit uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man should be ambitious and full of aspirations. Qing Shui didn't have far-reaching goals. All that he had today was simply built slowly out of desperate situations. He wasn't really ambitious and didn't have much desire to control others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For two months, Qing Shui didn't get any explanations from Xu Clan about the sneak attack. He reckoned it was the Wavemoon Cavern since he hadn't made a lot of enemies here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from that, the one who confused the man’s wisdom remained unknown. The man was probably dead by now as Xu Clan failed to detect the actual murderer. Still, they wouldn’t let go of the person who killed their member directly so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day, while Qing Shui took Qing Xiu for a walk in the yard, a few men from the Dragonwolf Palace came and requested their Palace Mistress to return. The Watermoon Cavern had sent their men, according to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was startled when he heard the news. The Watermoon Cavern had come even though there was almost a whole year to go and it had only been three months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The variation in affairs was beyond expectations. After a while, Qing Hanye showed up. She was worried as she understood the situation but she couldn’t avoid it nor refuse to return. Moreover, she couldn’t abandon her master there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Staring at Qing Shui, she looked upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. I’d go along with you to see what kind of men the Watermoon Cavern had sent.” Qing Shui, looking casual at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye felt slightly relieved after seeing Qing Shui being so relaxed. He had a magical charm that made everything seemed effortless with his presence. Things would fall into places naturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really want to go?” Qing Hanye asked Qing Shui after a brief thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded. He couldn’t state it too corny or act too intimately as there were others around. Qing Hanye felt his intent from Qing Shui’s eyes and blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunset Palace Mistress and other Mistresses wanted to go as well but Qing Shui made them stay, considering that Qing Xiu was still young. It was sufficient for him to visit the Dragonwolf Palace alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mistresses knew Qing Shui’s personality well. His every decision was his final word, especially in such matter. Hence, they didn’t say much except reminding them to be careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure?” It was the third time that Qing Hanye had asked the question along the journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really do not have any faith in your man, do you?” Qing Shui was left speechless. It was logical since they didn’t know his guiding ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiange and the rest cannot live without you.” Qing Hanye said in slight agony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hence I’ll be fine, don’t worry. I won’t blindly fight to the death. I must have certain confidence in the fact that I had the courage to come.”</span></p>
