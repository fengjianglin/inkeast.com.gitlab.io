 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><strong>AST 1553 - Another Way Of Claiming Justice, The Two Demons of the Chai Clan</strong></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t have much of an opinion towards their coming revenge. As of now, he was very relaxed. The increase in strength had triggered a change in his state of mind. The strength which he had in hand was very impressive. Only capable people would be able to keep their cool at all times. The reason being that in their eyes, the many things which people would find despair from, were not even worth mentioning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, in a way, this is great too. Well then, Sister Qin, tell me when it’s time to set off.” Qing Shui nodded and said casually.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I am going to rest now. Why don’t you go and have some rest as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days went by very quickly. During this time, Qing Shui had never once left Qin King Manor. Other than the time when he needed to train in the realm, he would spend the rest of his day in complete relaxation. Other than spending some of his time with Qin Qing, he spent the majority of his time out in the sun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person would only reflect when they were under quiet conditions. A person would improve only if they constantly meditated. Regardless of how skillful a person might be with their martial arts, they would still need a brain to be able to socialize with people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui spent much of his time thinking about his future. The woman had promised to meet him at the restaurant after a month to bring him to go and look for Yiye Jiange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, this was one of Qing Shui’s most important matters at hand. Warriors were beings with unlimited desire. Thus, the reason why Qing Shui cultivated was to bring services to other people. He didn’t want to be the world’s number one. He just didn’t want to be bullied by other people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking back about how he made it this far, Qing Shui had always struggled along his way. He had always worked hard in order to ensure his survival. Some people often said that a person’s talent was forced out by what they went through. Indeed, this was really the case. When a person was subject to extreme pressure and didn’t crumble, they would explode with newfound power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, a lot of rumors were spreading out in the public. It was mostly about Qin King Manor, the Chai Clan, the Yue Clan and the Gu Clan. There were no walls which wind couldn’t pass through. The things which happened between the clans had long since been spread out to the public. This time, the Gu Clan had been pushed to the edge of the winds and waves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To begin with, the Gu Clan already had a bad reputation. This time, it had even worked together with the Sacred Might Dynasty to attempt a sneak attack on Qin King Manor. Qin King Manor on the other hand, was known to be a generous clan. The incident this time had caused the Gu Clan to be the target of accusation by the public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, during these few days, other news were also been spread out to the public. It was about Miss Qin of Qin King Manor who would visit the Gu Clan to claim justice for Qin King Manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew the purpose behind this action when this news got passed on. It wasn’t for nothing that the name Miss Qin was quite influential around the area. Her nickname Fairy Qin wasn’t called for nothing. The incident this time had caused people to start neglecting the things which happened before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing which the majority of people couldn’t understand was why Qin King Manor decided to send Qin Qing off to fight for their justice. Despite how strong Fairy Qing was, she was still just a youngster. The Chai, Yue, as well as the Gu clans were all aristocratic clans. It seemed Qin King Manor had become a bit arrogant about their strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there were also other assumptions that were made, that was, Qin King Manor was trying to give them a chance this time. Which was why they sent a junior to go and fight for justice of their clan. It’s unlikely that the other clans would send out any of their monster-like seniors this time, as this would significantly bring down their status as aristocratic clans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rumors outside didn’t just stop there. Apparently, another news was heard. Qin Qing and Qing Shui sent out a challenge to the Yue and Gu clans. Furthermore, it was a compulsory challenge. In other words, a challenge which the opponents must accept.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a compulsory challenge was rejected, the opponent would have the right to directly intrude and attack the clan. Actually, that was exactly the intention. Qing Shui was only trying to do it in a more polite way. This was why he decided to go with the challenger letter option. A compulsory challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The designated location for the battle was at Moonwolf Island. By now, both Qing Shui and Qin Qing were already at Moonwolf Island. The duration of the battle was set to last one whole day. Within this fixed time, there must constantly be a person from each clan taking part in the battle. The battle would only end if either Qing Shui or Qin Qing died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were quite a lot of people who headed off for Moonwolf Island upon receiving the news. The majority of them were people from the Sacred Might Dynasty and the Great Qin Dynasty. Across the continent, martial arts was the most popular trend. A challenge could be seen as something above everything. Though the side that was being invited for the challenge was more dominant, people didn’t have high hopes for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adding the incident regarding the three clans, the Gu Clan in particular, which was despised by the people for working with outsiders to attempt a sneak attack on Qin King Manor. Regarding this matter, a lot of people had already been made aware about it. Qin King Manor was on the side of justice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonwolf Mountain Peak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Shui and Qin Qing stood on the highest spot of Moonwolf Island. There was about one hour left until the designated battle started. At the moment, it was only early in the morning. The golden threads of light shone on the ground, making the entire place shine in bright gold color.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world being flooded with gold, this was exactly how it was supposed to be.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, both Qing Shui and Qin Qing were already considered to be quite harmonious with each other. Though they were yet to be able to go back to how they once were. Somehow, Qing Shui kept feeling that there was something that kept them apart. Qing Shui knew that the aura being emitted by Qin Qing’s body had changed. Her &nbsp;temperament had also changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you thinking about?” Qin Qing looked at Qing Shui before moving her sight onto the rest of the crowd. Among them, there were also people from Qin King Manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am thinking about who will be sent out to battle against us.” Qing Shui wasn’t being honest. But it was also a reasonable excuse to make.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing could also feel that he wasn’t being honest. The reason being that prior to this, he was constantly keeping his eye on her. She could feel a bit of complexity in his eyes. It was a kind of expression which made her feel a bit panicked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter who shows up from the opposing side, we will need to beat them. Are you not feeling confident that we will win?” Qin Qing smiled and looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am always confident with myself. I am invincible when I fight together with sister Qing. If a couple are of the same mind, their combined determination will overcome all obstacles.” Qing Shui remembered himself saying this before. But it was the first time he said it ever since Qin Qing changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you ever go a day without taking advantage of me?” Qin Qing didn’t express any sort of dissatisfaction to the statement which Qing Shui made. She only responded in a calm tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you willing to let me take advantage of you?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the past, no one had dared talk to me like that. Even I am not sure why they wouldn’t dare to do so. Personally, I don’t feel that I looked ugly.” Qin Qing looked at Qing Shui and said something which even he found a bit clueless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know how the public addresses you? They call you Fairy Qing. Do you want to know why no one has ever dared to talk, even less confess feelings for you? It’s because almost all men would feel inferior when they stood in front of you. The gap between you and other men was too huge. Every man shares a same goal, that is to look for a woman whom they can love dearly. Naturally, they would fear finding a woman whom they have to serve.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing seemed a bit shy, “Is that really what you think? Do you also feel the same?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“More or less… Even I tend to feel inferior when standing in front of you……” Qing Shui chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, why do you still insist on taking advantage of me? It seems to me that what you say doesn’t match how you truly feel.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I did all of that just so we would be closer to each other. I want to pull you down from heaven. At least this way, I as an ordinary person, may still stand a chance in snatching you away.” At this point, Qing Shui had begun to look through many things. Hence, he no longer thought as much as he did before whenever he spoke, or rather, he had stopped being as cautious as before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s not possible for two people to have so many serious matters to discuss within a day. More than half of their conversations were basically unnecessary. Say, normal greetings, or sharing with each other about happy incidents which they have been through, these could all be considered as nonsense. For two people who were willing to talk to each other and share mutual feelings, they would be fine with whatever they said. On the other hand, when two people hated each other, they couldn’t even care less to talk about serious matters with each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing looked at Qing Shui and smiled, “Oh, as it seemed, you are really great at praising people. It’s my first time hearing someone complimenting me. In the future, please make sure that you compliment me more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Qin Qing did it on purpose. She didn’t want the flirting to continue. Certainly, Qing Shui was alright with it. After having this conversation, the two seemed to have gotten yet a bit closer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without noticing, it was almost noon. It was almost time for the challenge. Right at this moment, two figures appeared. They stood on a spot not far away from Qing Shui and Qin Qing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of the men had middle-aged look. The man on the left was taller and thinner. He had very deep eye sockets and a very tall nose. His lips were wide and thin. His entire appearance gave people the impression of a sharp eagle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man on the right was the complete opposite of the man on the left. Though he was a bit shorter, his body was almost two times thicker than the man on the left. His entire body was like a water bucket. His head was so huge that it covered his neck. When he smiled, he looked sweet like flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two monsters of the Chai Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, it’s the two monsters of the Chai Clan! I never thought that they would look so young!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that these two monsters of the Chai Clan were actually very old?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My grandpa once told me that five hundred years ago, the two monsters of Chai Clan were already very powerful. Since that time, they have retained exactly the same look as now. Apparently, they were already quite old at that time. I never expected for them to still look so young even now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ge Xiong, are the two monsters of the Chai Clan really that strong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. But it’s said that they are particularly weird. Not only are they ruthless, they are also very powerful. Furthermore, they have various methods to deal against their opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no judges for challenges like this. Usually, the battle would stop when one side decided to stop sending out warriors or if they ran out of time. However, it would still require one of the sides to agree on stopping the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The both of us are participating in the name of the Chai Clan! Nice to meet you!” The fatso who looked like a Maitreya said in a firm tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he might look like a Maitreya, those who were familiar with him would know that he was a murderer. A murderer who wouldn’t hesitate to slaughter anyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are representatives of Qin King Manor, we are here to demand justice for the clan itself! Nice to meet you!” Qing Shui said calmly. Though the fatso might be smiling, deep within his eyes, a very vague killing intent could be felt being emitted from them. Without a doubt, this was something which could never be fully covered. The only problem was that only very few were actually capable of feeling it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Justice? Are you being serious? You were the ones who first got your murderous hands on people from the Leng Clan. To top it all off, you guys even brought an all-out massacre to the clan itself. Who do you think should be the one fighting for justice?” The thin and tall middle-aged man who had been quiet all this time finally decided to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys should know better than us what kind of a clan the Leng Clan was. They wouldn’t hesitate to besiege two people with an entire group. Not only so, they even did shameful things right after the incident. If I could rewind time, I would make sure to slaughter every single one of their clan members.” Qing Shui said in a cold tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing stared at Qing Shui. To think that he didn’t blame her for killing the innocent. She was somehow moved by it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, there is nothing more to say about it. Let’s negotiate with them with our strength. Don’t say that we are trying to bully you two. You both are the ones who provoked us into a battle.” The tall and thin person was a person who was not good at expressing his feeling through words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out the Golden Battle Halberd and spoke to Qin Qing, “Be more careful, I can sense an unusual aura emitting from the two warrior’s bodies. It’s best if we end this battle quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speaking through his mind. The opponents wouldn’t be able to hear it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weapons which the thin and tall person took out were two black thorns. They were both shining in black and looked really bright. The fat person’s weapon on the other hand, was a pair of silver gloves. Qing Shui observed the fat person’s body which was full of meat. He found it hard to believe that he was a warrior who trained his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will fight the fat one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, Qing Shui immediately charged towards the fat person. The Golden Battle Halberd in his arm was like a golden dragon as it pierced its way towards the fat person. It left bright golden light across the track which it passed through. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
