 <p><strong>AST 1147 - Complete Victory, White Draconic Horse, Miss Yan? State Master Driving the Carriage?</strong></p>
 <p>"If you were to pledge your alliance to Lei Clan, I'll spare you your life!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now sure that many of the people in the crowd were just passersby or could be the helpers Lei Clan and the other blacksmith clans had called to boost their numbers. Their purpose was to make it such that Qing Shui didn't have a foothold here and cause him to not be able to stand his ground even if it wasn’t based on "reason".</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui looked at the man whose age was hard to tell. He was very strong and had quite an aura that stood out. He should be considered someone of status in Lei Clan!</p>
 <p>"Has Lei Clan always been so overbearing and imperious around here?" Qing Shui looked at the man and didn't smile. There was only calm, calmness that was like water.</p>
 <p>"Young man, since you don't know any better, then don't blame me for not going easy on you."</p>
 <p>After saying that, the man punched toward Qing Shui from afar. Together with his punch, his silhouette flashed and dashed toward Qing Shui and was fast like a disappearing wisp of smoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned. This was the first powerful expert he was up against in the other four continents. Although this person wasn't as powerful as Elder White and Elder Black from Great Yu Dynasty and could be said to be much weaker than them in comparison, in appearance, he definitely seemed stronger than Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui felt that there was a limit to this great power. This was why he wasn't anxious at all. Seeing that the other party had not dealt a killing move, he merely moved casually.</p>
 <p>Fish in Water!</p>
 <p>Taichi Cloud Hands!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swung casually, hitting on that guy's wrist, pushing him back with a soft yet domineering power. Although it seemed as if Qing Shui had gotten the upper hand, he knew that it was only due to the superiority of Taichi.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's Taichi had reached a formidable stage. The Fish in Water movement technique was something he had comprehended on the basis of the Cloudmist Steps or rather, it could be said that he had incorporated it into Cloudmist Steps. His plan was to fully merge Fish in Water together with the Cloudmist Steps before incorporating it into the Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>The power wasn't strong but the stance was extremely profound. The man from Lei Clan felt a tingly pain in his hand which was hit by Qing Shui but it wasn't a big deal. However, he no longer dared to underestimate Qing Shui and his eyes became very serious. With a push of his feet, he rose into mid-air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed after him. After all, if they were to stay on land, they could easily bring down the buildings in the surroundings. Neither of them spoke. Qing Shui was now using the Duality Steps together with Fish in Water.</p>
 <p>The Duality Steps was also known as the Taichi Steps and its prowess was further accentuated when used together with Taichi. A faint golden color appeared around Qing Shui. It was so faint that he was the only person who could see it.</p>
 <p>Lightning Eruption Fist!</p>
 <p>A faint violet light flashed on the man's fist, like violet electricity. It even brought along crackling sounds. With a strong stomp, a huge explosion rang out and the man shot toward Qing Shui like a cannonball.</p>
 <p>Taichi Single Whip!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved up and used another tricky move, once again striking on the man’s hand. However, the opponent's fist surprisingly turned back with a weird movement like a "Spirited Snake coming out from the cave", hitting Qing Shui's hand.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Qing Shui felt a numbing feeling through his body. At that moment, the man leaned back and his right leg kicked toward Qing Shui's head without any notice.</p>
 <p>Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's senses were very clear and he knew that this numbing feeling was just momentary. However, to people of their cultivation level, just one instant was sufficient. Moving as his mind willed, he appeared not far away in a blind spot behind the man.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that martial techniques with lightning attributes were very powerful and numbing effects might also appear because of them. However, the terrifying part was that in that moment, even the person's senses would be numbed. Of course, this was something that was related to one's spirit energy. If one's spirit energy was very powerful, the numbing effect would only be a very short time and one's consciousness would not be paralyzed.</p>
 <p>Earlier, he hadn't expected the man's fist techniques to be so agile.</p>
 <p>That change in the final moment was really a great piece of work and even Qing Shui wasn't expecting it.</p>
 <p>The man's battle technique was very powerful. After all, it could cause Qing Shui to be numbed for a moment.</p>
 <p>This time around, the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring had saved him once. In that moment, even if he were to release the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm, he might not have made it in time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's figure disappeared as elusively as a ghost, appearing not far away from the guy from Lei Clan where his blind spot was. Suddenly, he struck out his palm toward the man's left ribs!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>At almost the same time, the man swung his hand in an attempt to save himself and concurrently activated his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. Even the activation of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was something that happened in an instant and very quickly, a huge "stone statue" appeared, encompassing the man within it.</p>
 <p>It was as if Qing Shui slapped his palm against a hard rock. Earlier, the spot the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring had sent him wasn't the man's blind spot directly. He had to use Duality Steps once to reach there.</p>
 <p>The Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring couldn't reach a ten-meter distance from a person.</p>
 <p>"Lad, I've underestimated you."</p>
 <p>The man was first forced to use his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and then with a shake of his hand, a dragon spear that was close to two Zhang long appeared in his hand. The huge dragon spear was a violet color and it held a violent power. The dragon spear didn't have a spear head or rather, it could be said that the spearhead was an extremely twisted looking dragon head. The entire dragon spear was as if there was a dragon tangling itself around the spear.</p>
 <p>"I'm going to use my weapon. Bring out your strongest powers. If you were to lose your life because of your arrogance, you won't even have a chance to cry in regret." The guy frowned but didn't attack immediately.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p>Taichi Sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dare to be too careless. The pernicious aura the dragon spear was emitting was too strong. It should have been stained by much blood. Qing Shui didn't move. The essence of Taichi was to attack after the opponent does.</p>
 <p>Dragon Emerging From the Seas!</p>
 <p>The guy from Lei Clan shook his huge dragon spear and swung it toward Qing Shui from a distance. It was as if the guy had merged with the spear, tearing through space and charging toward Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>When the world was first created, it was split into Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang encompass everything in the world!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Duality Steps to move while he drew a circle with the Big Dipper Sword he was holding. The circle he drew was very interesting, with one side being black, the other being white and the middle was separated by a curvy line.</p>
 <p>After he drew the circle, it didn't disappear but stopped in mid-air!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then continued to draw a second one. There was an indescribable profoundness to his slow movements and they exuded a majestic feeling, one that was very old.</p>
 <p>The huge dragon spear flashed with a brilliant violet light, as if a violet dragon was dashing toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>The dragon spear penetrated the light circle that was left in the air but half its impact was reduced and when it went through another one, which was the last circle, its speed had completely reduced.</p>
 <p>It only took Qing Shui two Taichi circles.</p>
 <p>The Big Dipper Sword trembled.</p>
 <p>Taichi Golden Chi!</p>
 <p>A golden colored sword Qi appeared from the Big Dipper Sword and slashed out toward the dragon spear whose impact had been reduced greatly.</p>
 <p>At a spot below the spearhead, there was a white-colored scale that was the size of a palm under the dragon's neck, forming a crescent shape. It was commonly referred to as the reverse scale, the gathering point of the dragon's blood. The dragon's blood would be gathered at this point and then sent throughout its body. Therefore, that spot was a dragon's weakness, a spot which couldn't be touched. It was said that the method with the highest possibility of killing a dragon was to attack its reverse scale.</p>
 <p>Dragons have reverse scale; those who touch it must die!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that touching the reverse scale of this dragon spear wouldn't spell death but that spot should be the weakest spot on it. The weapon was too long and its strength would be spread out. This spot must should be the most fragile one.</p>
 <p>For weapons, an inch shorter would spell an increase of an inch of danger. Barefisted martial arts were the most agile and it was dangerous to let masters of barefisted martial arts as well as assassins get near since they had endless killing moves they could use which were extremely dangerous, treacherous and vicious. In close range combat, the one important thing which couldn't be ignored was one's footwork.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't afraid of people with long weapons. When his abilities were close to his opponent's it would be too easy for him to get close. When his opponent is using such a long weapon, once Qing Shui got close, that weapon wouldn't be of much use.</p>
 <p>Close combat fight!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pushed the dragon spear away slightly and attacked from the top with an indescribable speed. Most importantly, he was like a slippery fish in the water.</p>
 <p>Fish in Water!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's footwork caused his opponent to feel a deep sense of helplessness!</p>
 <p>The expression of the guy from Lei Clan finally changed and his dragon spear disappeared. Two violet colored metallic claws appeared on his hands. The materials they were made from seemed to be very similar to the dragon spear from earlier.</p>
 <p>They hadn't fought for long and it was clear that Qing Shui was having the upper hand. The guy from Lei Clan now seemed to be in a somewhat sorry state. Qing Shui even put away his weapon now and was only using his Taichi Fist and his profoundness of his movements for his attacks.</p>
 <p>Pa...</p>
 <p>A continuous stream of Pa! Pa! sounds rang out. Earlier, Qing Shui was only able to hit once after a very long time but eventually, the gap between each sound got increasingly closer. Although it seemed as if the prowess of the attacks weren't sufficient, his movements and the profoundness of his techniques were unrivaled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. One would gain the fastest progress in actual battle. This was an all-rounded training. The Fish in Water movements were already considered to have entered the initial phase of merging. Even Qing Shui himself felt exhilarated and had a great sense of achievement.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>When it was about time, Qing Shui attacked directly onto the opponent's chest, sending him flying backward. Earlier, the strength which Qing Shui had exerted wasn't sufficient but he hadn't been attacking with his full strength. It was more for training his martial techniques and movements.</p>
 <p>The man from Lei Clan spewed out fresh blood and fell down from mid-air. He'd be seriously injured even if he wasn't dead. Since that the situation was already in a deadlock, there was no need for him to hold back.</p>
 <p>Many people had already gathered around by now and were watching. There were also some who were powerful cultivators. Qing Shui could sense them when he came down.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood before them while they appeared to be terrified and uneasy. Just then, before anyone said anything, a loud voice rang out.</p>
 <p>"Make way, make way, Miss Yan is here to get her weapon..."</p>
 <p>"Ah, Miss Yan is here. Quick, make way..."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>From a distance, a beast carriage was driven over. When Qing Shui saw this beast carriage, he was also stunned. The beast pulling it was completely snow-white all over and wasn't very big. It was five meters long and three meters tall, just like a horse. However, its horse head was slightly savage looking. It still looked very nice though. It also had two deer antler-like horns on its head, making it appear very handsome.</p>
 <p>White Draconic Horse！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this big white horse, a legendary horse with dragon's blood. These types of horses weren't considered powerful demonic beasts but what Qing Shui was astonished at was how valuable they were.</p>
 <p>The White Draconic Horse was only at elementary Xiantian. However, it was worth a lot. White Draconic Horses were very rare and compared to being in a carriage pulled by a Martial Emperor level demonic beast, a person who had a carriage pulled by a White Draconic Horse would command a higher authority.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui hadn't been here for long, he had come to understand quite a lot of stuff. For example, only the female members of the royal family or clans in powerful cities would possibly have a White Draconic Horse but their numbers were very small.</p>
 <p>Miss Yan, Yan City, Yan Clan!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't expected the young miss from Yan Clan would come to the Divine Weapon Street. She was here to collect a weapon. From which blacksmith store?</p>
 <p>The carriage pulled by the White Draconic Horse was very big and the one driving it was an ordinary looking old man. However, the closer they came, Qing Shui felt that the old man was unfathomable.</p>
 <p>State Master level expert!</p>
 <p>He was a State Master level expert who seemed to be more powerful than Elder Black and Elder White. This was an old man who was driving the carriage. Who was Miss Yan to be able to let a State Master drive her carriage?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very astonished!</p>
