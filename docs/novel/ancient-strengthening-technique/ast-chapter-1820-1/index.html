 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was not much time left. Qing Shui couldn’t afford to pay attention to so many things. Very quickly, he had managed to help Shen Huang took off her clothes, leaving only her a bra and underwear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt an itchy sensation in his nose. Though it hadn’t gotten to the extent that he started having a nosebleed, he still felt as if blood was going to gush out of his nose. The woman who only had bra and underwear left on her looked incredibly beautiful. Her slender figure and her jade-like skin were out of this world. During his time in this life, though he might have seen Suet Jade before, he was sure that not even Suet Jade would look as good as the woman’s skin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was like the fairy who had come down from the vast night sky. She possessed a tranquil and elegant aura, making her so noble that words simply just couldn’t describe her. Anyone would want to protect a woman like this. Only people as crazy as Jin Feng would like to harm her. The fact that he was unable to obtain her had caused him to come up with evil intentions toward her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was constantly injecting her with the Golden Needles with his hand. Both his hands looked like afterimages as he continuously put pressure on the important acupoints across her body. This was an inherited Divine Technique given to him as a psychiatrist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui started sweating. The reason was that his hands were almost going to touch every nooks and corners of the woman’s body. Though there was still a thin layer of cloth getting in the way of his hands, the soft sensation upon interaction with it was already enough to make him suffer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, Shen Huang’s condition got more and more stable. This had caused Qing Shui to be a bit proud of himself for first, his medical expertise, and second, his ability to control himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without noticing, four hours had passed. Qing Shui had already stopped the treatment. Before he managed to catch his breath, Shen Huang had already opened her eyes. Her eyes looked like the bright moon across the sky. Though pure, it didn’t lose its profoundness. It was so magnanimous that others wouldn’t dare to directly look into it. Even the current Qing Shui also felt ashamed when looking at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was wearing all tidily while Shen Huang was the one wearing very little clothes. However, at the moment, Qing Shui somehow felt like he was the one instead who was immodest with his clothing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was very calm. There was no sign of her panicking or anything. Particularly when she lowered down her head and saw herself, though there was a slightly unnatural look across her face, Qing Shui was able to clearly tell that she was calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such a calm woman…” Qing Shui secretly let out a sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You were actually capable of removing the poison caused by Intoxicated Immortal Fragrance?” Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui in awe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never thought that this thing which promoted estrus would be called the Intoxicated Immortal Fragrance. Back in his realm, he also had something with exactly the same name. However, only their names were similar. Their functions were clearly different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you prefer it if I removed the toxic through this way?” Qing Shui opened his eyes wide and said loudly. It almost sounded as if he was shouting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was startled. Very few people would actually dare to shout at her like this. However, when she saw Qing Shui’s rushed breathing, it soon became clear to her what he was going through. With everything becoming clear to her, she smiled and lowered down her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But because she had lowered down her head, she immediately spotted the exaggeratingly erected part of his lower body and blushed. Though she had never done the sort of thing before, it didn’t mean that she had not the slightest idea what it was. To think that this man was actually able to hold it in and used another method to cure her of her toxin...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep down, she didn’t know how she was feeling. She was happy, but at the same time, also felt touched. To ensure he didn’t hurt her, he had resorted to using the alternate way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She lifted up her head only to see an awkward Qing Shui. When she saw his lips, she remembered the time when she had kissed him. She also remembered that she also bit him. Even now, there was still a faint tooth mark there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he quickly sat down. Though he knew about it, at that time, the moment was too crucial. Added on that Shen Huang was also unconscious, he acted like it was nothing. He finally managed to calm down when she was awake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you. You are a good man.” Shen Huang said her thanks with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I really didn’t want to be a good man. It is way too difficult for me to hold myself back.” Qing Shui shook his head as he exaggeratingly looked at Shen Huang’s beautiful body with admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang got a bit embarrassed from being observed by Qing Shui. However, she didn’t try to stop him. On the contrary, she felt something weird in her heart. It was as if for a moment, she had gotten very close to this man. The two seemed to be more and more familiar with each other. In reality, from the beginning until now, they had only met for less than three times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui checked on the time and began helping Shen Huang took out her needles. It took him about the time needed to prepare tea to help her take out all the needles. By now, Shen Huang was already wild awake. Qing Shui was very close to her, so much so that occasionally, he was able to interact with her skin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was taking out the needles, it was not as simple as merely taking them out. Shen Huang didn’t think that Qing Shui would take advantage of her. If he had wanted to do it, he could have done it to her while she was unconscious. That would have been his most thorough way of doing it. Furthermore, she also wouldn’t have had the right to make any comments on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, for now, Shen Huang believed that she was unable to see through this man. If he had been uninterested with her, he wouldn’t have had the nervous reaction and also looked at her with eyes filled with great admiration, which she was clearly able to see from him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, she felt that she didn’t really understand what kind of man this man was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you answer one question?” Shen Huang asked gently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Has the thought of using that method to save me never once crossed your mind?” Shen Huang said softly after a moment of hesitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stared at Shen Huang and said, “It might not be too late to change do it now. Furthermore, I think doing it that way will feel even better.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard… I am just trying to ask a question.” Shen Huang said with a slight contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have thought about it for about a hundred times but then I stopped. If I continued on, I would have caused a beauty to pass away. Since I have decided to be a gentleman, I might as well go all the way. I know that you don’t want to share a man with other women. I already have my own wives and this is the one good thing which I have done after fighting against myself for a long time. Who would have thought that this was actually a mistake.” Qing Shui sighed while looking at Shen Huang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui noticed that the woman who just woke up had undergone some changes in personalities. She was no longer as mysterious as before. Back then, she used to be like the bright moon in the night sky, giving people the feeling that they could never reach her. But now, he came to realize that she had become more like a living human than ever before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Please take some rest. I will take my leave now.” Qing Shui took back his needles and was about to take his leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am hungry. Could you go make me some food?” Shen Huang slowly sat up.&nbsp;</span></p>
