 <p><strong>AST 1301 - The Ling Clan, Huge Gap In Strength. The Five Continents Has No Threat To Qing Clan</strong></p>
 <p>Unknowingly, Qing Shui has already stayed in the Qing Clan for a week. He spent most of his time helping the people from the Qing Clan increased their strength. He mainly helped them with Constitution Nurturing and with his current strength, he was able to provide significant aid to them. To the people from the Qing Clan, these were already considered to be a very significant leap.</p>
 <p>During this time, Qing Shui would enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal in the morning. Other than the time he spent inside, of course not including the time at night, Qing Shui would spend the rest of his time to guide the people from the Qing Clan through their cultivation, including his time to do morning practices. He would also help them arrange their own specific routine.</p>
 <p>Today, Qing Shui planned to go visit the so-called Heifeng Clan and Ling Clan. Even though the two clans had yet to do anything overboard ever since they came here, Qing Shui felt the need to thoroughly analyze them. If any accidents were to happen, he would found it too late to cry as this place was his headquarter.</p>
 <p>He didn’t let Luan Luan learn the Beast Divine Possession as she was too weak for it. Even though Yu Chang didn’t have innate talents that were as powerful as Mingyue Gelou’s, hers was quite a lot more powerful than Qing Bei’s. Surprisingly, she had actually managed to catch up later on.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange left. If Qing Shui wasn’t home, Luan Luan would turn out to be the most powerful one amongst the people from the Qing Clan. Furthermore, she also had a lot of tamed beasts. Hence, Qing Shui left behind a lot of things that would help her cultivation and save her time to increase her strength.</p>
 <p>The powerful feature of the Seven Heart of Orifices was that it would likely leap straight across small bottlenecks and helped increase the chances of breakthrough for the larger ones. Furthermore, Qing Shui had just helped her with his Gold Needle Acupuncture and Constitution Nurturing. He also gave her some medicinal pills which could help in her breakthrough.</p>
 <p>He already started to use the medicinal herbs from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui had already managed to collect some of the herbs which he used in the past. Other than a minority of the medicinal pills, he left majority of the remaining ones for them.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan’s formidable strength in the future was something which could never be stopped. The first thing which Qing Shui wanted to do was to build a foundation for her first. It was just the same as building a house, if its foundation wasn’t firm enough, the height of the building itself would be limited. Hence, Qing Shui didn’t make Luan Luan’s cultivation speed as his priority. All along, he considered building up the foundation as the main thing for her. Only after he had arrived at the Western Oxhe Continent did he know that his decision was right.</p>
 <p>With Luan Luan’s innate talent, it wasn’t too difficult for her to cultivate and increase her speed. Given about another than ten years time, Luan Luan’s cultivation should be able to reach great height. It might take even less time with the help of the medicinal pills and martial techniques. If she could run into any unusual opportunities, she might be able to take yet another huge leap.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, let me follow you to the Ling Clan and Heifeng Clan!” Luan Luan said while she hugged Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
 <p>“That’s great too!” Qing Shui smiled after he thought for a while.</p>
 <p>“I’m also going!” Qing Ming twitched his mouth and said.</p>
 <p>“How is your cultivation progressing?” Qing Shui asked looking at Qing Ming.</p>
 <p>“My speed is now more than five to six times faster than before. It feels really good to be faster.” Qing Ming revealed a smile of exultation when he talked about this. He seemed really excited.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be satisfied with your progress now. There is no end to learning, you have no choice but to make yourself faster. At the time when I was your age, I was already a lot faster than you.” Qing Shui was actually lying. He was scared that Qing Ming would already feel satisfied with just this.</p>
 <p>“I don’t believe you!” Qing Ming said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, come here. I am going to just stand here and not move even one foot away from here. I will keep my legs on the ground. I will promise you anything as long as you managed to touch the corner of my shirt.” While speaking, Qing Shui drew out a circle that was one foot long with his legs.</p>
 <p>“You cannot push me away with your martial arts, do not fly, do not dig underground, and lastly, do not walk out of the circle.” Qing Ming said craftily with his eyes wide opened.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Ming finished speaking, he immediately leaped himself towards Qing Shui. After that, he right away slammed the small circle with his hands and legs wide open.</p>
 <p>Despite his body being small, he was able to completely cover up the entire circle. As for Qing Shui, he couldn’t leave the ground, nor could he attempt to block it.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui was really happy. It seemed like this little brat was quite smart. Looking at the way he leaped towards Qing Shui, Luan Luan and some of the girls who rushed here all started to laugh.</p>
 <p>Despite this, Qing Shui still had tricks up his sleeves. Qing Shui was a person who was proficient in the Nine Palace Steps and he could move as much as he like within the Nine Palace. The circle below his feet, as well as his entire body, instantly moved away by one foot. Furthermore, the people in the surrounding wasn’t even able to notice that he moved. Qing Ming ended up on the ground instead and after that, he immediately moved his sight at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, you cheated!” Qing Ming said in a firm tone.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean I cheated? I didn’t get out of the circle.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“We have already said that you are not allowed to stop me with external forces. I am sure I have leaped into the circle itself, yet it turned out that I found myself outside of it. You must have pushed me aside.” Qing Ming said in a firm tone.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t push you. You should be able to feel it. For example, I can use a kind of trick to deceive you and make you think that the position of the circle which you’re looking at is correct when it’s actually wrong.’ Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui didn’t really use it. It was easy for someone who had formidable Spirit Energy like him to use this kind of tricks on Qing Ming.</p>
 <p>Qing Ming was stunned. After he thought for a while, he felt that he didn’t really understand it. He refused to give up and once again charged towards Qing Shui. This time, he no longer used the methods he did before. Instead, he tried to grab Qing Shui with his hands and kept his eyes deadly locked onto Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Even though the ground below his feet was a circle, Qing Ming was unable to touch even the corner of Qing Shui’s clothes. The little brat’s bullheadedness got triggered and he started to grab Qing Shui non-stop.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qing Shui spoke and dropped him a few hints. He instructed him to use the Duality Steps.</p>
 <p>Duality gave birth to wind. Wind strengthened water and fire, but water and fire were arch enemies of each other.</p>
 <p>It was as if Qing Shui’s words had a kind of magical power, Qing Ming had started to understand the usage of the Duality Steps. He constantly changed his footsteps while he performed the Solitary Rapid Fists with his hands, and initiated attacks at Qing Shui from all sides. In fact, he was already adept at using the Duality Steps to begin with and now, it even seemed like he had broken through his previous realm.</p>
 <p>Initially, Qing Shui had already helped him develop his body physique through Constitution Nurturing to help increase his speed by a few times and now, he even managed to ascend in his realm. If no accidents were to happen, he should already be able to cultivate the Trinity Steps, or maybe even the Four Phases Step.</p>
 <p>It seemed like Qing Ming had also immersed himself in a certain realm. It was as if he had gotten into a kind of State of No Conscious. However, he was still able to hear what Qing Shui said and this state seemed kind to appear randomly. It was like he was able to do the things which he found difficult to pull off on normal occasions.</p>
 <p>Just like this, after about fifteen minutes past, Qing Ming stopped. He revealed a face of joy.</p>
 <p>“How do you feel?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“In the past, I used to feel that I was really, really fast. But now, even though I may have gotten a lot faster than before, I don’t feel as fast as I used to.” Qing MIing said after he thought for a while.</p>
 <p>“Yes. In the past, you used to be just like a frog under a well. Although you only jumped a foot away, you would feel that you jumped very far. But now that you are already out of the well, despite leaping ten foot ahead, the distance is still insignificant to the vastness of heavens. This is why you no longer feel as fast as before, the primary reason is because you have not yet achieved the level ‘so close yet so worlds apart’.” Qing Shui was very happy in his heart. This could be considered a critical break through for Qing Ming.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, let me go and try to familiar myself with it!” Qing Ming immediately ran away after he finished speaking.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. Somehow, he found that this son of his was currently on the right track.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou was also smiling. She noticed that her burden has gotten a lot lighter since Qing Shui came back. Prior to this, she used to fear that she didn’t educate her son well. She was always concerned that he would learn the wrong things. When Qing Shui came back, the way he educated his son was totally different compared to hers. He gave him a lot of freedom with only a tiny bit of restriction. As this happened, she noticed that her son has gotten less rebellious. Furthermore, he really admired his father.</p>
 <p>She was really happy to see this. In fact, she really enjoyed it. In the future, if Qing Shui could come back once per month, she could leave educating her son to him.</p>
 <p>Qing SHui summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Luan Luan hopped onto it before she waved her hand at her family and flew towards Ling Clan. After all, Qing Ming seemed to share quite a decent relationship with Ling Clan.</p>
 <p>Actually, both Ling Clan and Heifeng Clan weren’t far away from Qing Shui. Qing Shui used the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant as his mean of transport mainly only to use it as a temporary expedient.</p>
 <p>Even under the influence of Heaven and Earth’s Law across the five continents, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant still possessed more than four hundred sun worth of strength. Across the five continents, it was undoubtedly an unrivalled existence. After all, there wasn’t anyone who was capable of unleashing a hundred nimbus worth of strength. From the way it seemed on the surface, the tallest height one could reach was at most worth only slightly more than ten nimbus. Of course, this was excluding those who tried to hide themselves within the continents. After all, no one knew how much strength a warrior was keeping hidden within themselves.</p>
 <p>The speed of the Golden S caled Dragon Elephant was very slow. But because they were close to Ling Clan and Heifeng Clan, they were able to reach fairly quickly. After that, the vicious aura of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant immediately pressed down towards the ground with earth-shattering aura.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did this as a way to demonstrate his strength. Though this method might have been a bit tyranny, it wasn’t too overboard. As of now, it’s only through the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant for him to express his status as a warrior.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui and Luan Luan came down from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, there were already a lot of people in front of the Ling Residence. Each and every one of them had a nervous look on their face as they looked at the tyrant-like Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant in the sky.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared back directly at the people below. Among them, there were some old men, middle-aged men, and young men. Together, there were roughly 200 of them and they were basically all warriors. Some of them even possessed decent strength. Despite being affected by the Laws of Heaven and Earth, they still managed to achieve roughly more than ten nimbus worth of strength. This actually made Qing Shui felt surprised. The most powerful being within the five continents was only worth this much. As for the girls and Luan Luan from the Qing Clan, they had all already surpassed this level of strength.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Luan Luan, the people from the Ling Clan all let out sighs of relief. An old man with white hair and a youthful face said politely. “Sorry for not meeting you to welcome you when you came back, senior!”</p>
 <p>“Old man, it’s Qing Shui who was being too bold. I am sorry for frightening everyone.” Qing Shui wasn’t used on making too much of a deal about himself. Hence, he replied in a friendly tone.</p>
 <p>“That’s absolutely not the case. I wasn’t aware that you’re back, hence, I didn’t manage to go pay you a visit. I hope that you can forgive me for this.” The old man addressed him as a senior as soon as he started to talk to him. After all, it would only take Qing Shui a few breaths to eliminate the Ling Clan.</p>
 <p>“Senior, please come in. Eldest mistress, please!” The old man quickly let Qing Shui walked towards the Ling Clan. At this moment, the people from the clan had dispersed themselves and were gone to do their own stuff.</p>
 <p>“Old man, I am aware that the Ling Clan has been really close to the Qing Clan lately, why don’t you call me Qing Shui?” Both Qing Shui and the old man walked together towards the Ling Clan.</p>
 <p>“How can this be? No, no.” The old man said hurriedly.</p>
 <p>“Qing Ming is my son. Hence, old man, you don’t have to act so formally. Even though I have killed quite a lot of people, I have never killed someone innocent.” Qing Shui was aware that the old man must have heard about him before. Hence, he should be a bit scared of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The old man’s eyes flashed. After that, he said gently, “Well then, I, as an old man, is going to indulge myself and start calling you Qing Shui.”</p>
 <p>After all, the gap in strength was just too large.</p>
 <p>In the living room!</p>
 <p>“Old man, before I left last time, I haven’t come across the Ling Clan and the Heifeng Clan. Can I ask where you guys moved from?” Qing Shui smiled and said while he took the tea handed to him.</p>
 <p>“Actually, both the Ling Clan and the Heifeng Clan came from the Southern Viewing Continent.</p>
