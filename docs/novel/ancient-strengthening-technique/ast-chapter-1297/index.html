 <p><strong>AST 1297 - An Otherworldly Kind Of Attraction, A Change In Plan</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this might be Yiye Jiange’s chance. Even though he felt a bit worried, he also felt really excited for her.</p>
 <p>“I will stay cautious. I still don’t feel like dying so early just yet. Even if I were to die, I would at least wait until I give birth to a child of yours.” On Yiye Jiange’s otherworldly attractive face was a shy and joyous smile.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t we start working hard together now? For all you know, your wish might just come true after ten months.” Qing Shui put his hands around her slender waist.</p>
 <p>“You have promised to let me be the one to initiate it. You have to keep your promise.” Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</p>
 <p>In the past, Qing Shui had promised Yiye Jiange to let her take the initiative to strip his clothes. She wanted to be the active one. In fact, she even said that she wanted to be his knight. At the moment when she mentioned that, there was an unusual charm around her. She had an otherworldly attractive face without makeup and the things which she said sounded extremely alluring.</p>
 <p>“Of course, this is something which I can still afford to do.” Qing Shui was reluctant to admit his mistake and replied.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui with a faint smile. She didn’t really say anything.</p>
 <p>“Well then, you will also have to be more open-minded, won’t you? You need to have thicker skin. I won’t resist you.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, I will think about this.” Yiye Jiange chuckled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently pulled Yiye Jiange and immediately brought her into his embrace.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you have said before that if I don’t initiate any moves, you won’t touch me.” Yiye Jiange said gently.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I only promised to let you be the active one to eat me up. The only thing I said was that I wouldn’t take the initiative to eat you up. As for other things, I can still do a few of them. What do you think?” Qing Shui hugged her very tightly. He really meant it directly. Even though he may not be able to eat her up, he can still do other things.</p>
 <p>“You are still such a rascal.” Yiyi Jiange gently embraced Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
 <p>“Jiange, have you missed me?” Qing Shui whispered in her ear.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the exquisite ears of hers. It looked just like a silver ingot, its beauty couldn’t be described with words. Her ears looked white and exquisite. Moving on downwards was her slender and pinkish neck. It was really eye-catching and sexy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately let out his tongue and licked her ear. This immediately caused Yiye Jiange to tremble and she also began to hug his neck tighter and tighter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that even though Yiye Jiange started to tremble and cried out gently in surprise, she didn’t really struggle and tried to stop him. Seeing this, he became more daring and gently began to suck her attractive earlobes.</p>
 <p>As this happened, Yiye Jiange’s body once again trembled. She started to hug Qing Shui’s neck tighter. Qing Shui on the other hand got so agitated to the point that he felt like his beast blood was boiling from the indescribable heart-thumping feelings.</p>
 <p>He gently sucked her earlobes. At the same time, he also felt reluctant to just had his hands around her beautiful waist. He started to progress his way downwards gently and began to put his hands on her extremely beautiful buttocks through her clothes. The sensation felt so comfortable that he couldn’t help but to grab it tightly. That momentary interaction immediately caused Qing Shui’s lower body to stand up like a javelin. It felt as if it was going to burst anytime soon. He right away pushed it against a soft spot on her body.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange let out a gentle gasp. She whispered in his ears. “Know your limits……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out one of his hands and lightly whispered by her ear. “Let me defile you, defile the goddess in my mind.”</p>
 <p>As Yiye Jiange heard what Qing Shui said, her body abruptly shook. At this moment, Qing Shui put one of his hand into her shirt. Without her cloth as an obstruction, the smooth sensation was enough to let Qing Shui to let out a groan. He immediately put his tongue into her ear and started to swivel around her ear.</p>
 <p>Yes…...</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange’s body shook suddenly. Qing Shui’s words from before, together with the impact which he brought upon her now, had made her to embrace him tightly and not let him move.</p>
 <p>She was so sensitive. Qing Shui didn’t know if it was because he had become more charming or they had unique body physiques. He hugged Yiye Jiange. It somehow felt quite satisfying to be able to let her experience the feelings of getting her soul lifted up.</p>
 <p>He still felt really reluctant to take his hands out. Not only did he leave them there, he had even begun to make his way towards the gap between her butt. As he touched it, the only thing he felt was a smooth sensation. This once again caused Yiye Jiange’s body to tremble.</p>
 <p>“You little scoundrel! Take out your hand!” Yiye Jiange’s voice sounded really soft. She didn’t dare to look at Qing Shui. Her entire face looked red like the sunset clouds across the western sky.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he slowly drew out his hands. That gentle process of drawing out his hands caused Yiye Jiange to once again tremble lightly. Qing Shui slowly moved his hand in front of himself and Yiye Jiange, and started to smell it.</p>
 <p>“Jiange, this is still your……”</p>
 <p>“Ah, this is so disgusting!” Yiye Jiange abruptly pushed Qing Shui and quickly ran away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the cream-like stained on his hand and knew that she felt really embarrassed about it. As he lifted up his head, he noticed that both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were making their way here.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue looked just like how she used to be, magnanimous as well as profound. As he looked at her, he got reminded of the impact which he brought upon her the first time when he was on the Golden Winged Thunder Condor</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li would forever have her purple clothes on her. All of her clothes were purple in color. Qing Shui wiped his hands on his shirt. After that, he went forward and grabbed each of them with both of his hands.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really missed the old times. There was a moment when he used to spend a long time with both of the girls. Now, he felt an unusual sensation while he grabbed both of their hands. It felt as if he hadn’t done this for a long time,</p>
 <p>“It has been so long since we last stayed together like this.” Qing Shui said in a slightly guilty tone.</p>
 <p>“Yes, but we already feel really happy to know that you’re here. Next time, we will have more time with each other. It feels great to be able to stay together.” Canghai Mingyue said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, whose room are you going to visit first tonight?” Huoyun Liu-Li blinked her sexy, long, and narrow eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his lower chin and thought for a while. “I wish to make a huge bed. This way, we will be able to stay in the same bed together.”</p>
 <p>“Sharing a huge blanket together? In your dreams!” Huoyun Liu-Li said in a playful manner.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, you don’t like it? Think about it, this way, you will be able to see what you want to see…..”</p>
 <p>“Bastard, don’t ever mention it.” The more Canghai Mingyue thought about it, the more she found it embarrassing.</p>
 <p>However, Huoyun Liu-Li instead lets out a sly laugh. She attached herself to Qing Shui’s arms and seemed unusually satisfied. “Qing Shui, are the other four continents beautiful?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked really curiously.</p>
 <p>“It’s not beautiful! The place didn’t have you guys in it.” Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>“I feel that that place should be really beautiful. Where were you?” Huoyun Liu-Li revealed a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“You guys will be able to head there very soon. Now, I can come back once every month. In the future, I might be able to take you guys over as well, but this is still going to take some time.” Qing Shui grabbed both hands of the girls even tighter.</p>
 <p>No matter how beautiful a place might be, if he would be the only one in there, he wouldn’t found it to be beautiful regardless. On the other hand, even if a place was ugly, as long as your close relatives and the people you liked were there, you would found it to be really beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Our children are a bit older now. In the future, we will also be able to speed up our cultivation. Now, we are getting further and further away from you. By then, will you dump us?” Canghai Mingyue said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Yueyue, why don’t we have 300 rounds of great war with each other tonight. I am going to show you just how formidable your husband can be. In the future, whenever you say something like this, will it be alright for us to have a great night together?” Qing Shui chuckled. Despite this, he felt really touched deep down. Those may have been his and their children, but they were instead the only ones looking after them.</p>
 <p>“Sister, you’re so blessed. All it takes is for Qing Shui to say one word, and everything would have worked out for you.” Huoyun Liu-Li said a bit craftily.</p>
 <p>“You darned brat. Why don’t you go and have 300 rounds of great war of love with him tonight?” Canghai Mingyue said a bit grumpily and embarrassingly.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li still retained her charming attitude from before. Qing Shui really enjoyed it. Her crafty, yet sexy attitude, resembled that of a little demoness.</p>
 <p>After a while, Yun Duan, Di Qing, Hai Dongqing, basically all of Qing Shui’s women arrived. There weren’t really that many of them. Basically, merely a warrior at Xiantian Realm would have had more wives than Qing Shui himself. Simultaneously, it also couldn’t be considered that few in amounts. From Qing Shui’s perspective, he had quite a lot of women. Furthermore, he felt that he couldn’t afford to lose any of them, even losing one of them would make him feel extremely hurt.</p>
 <p>Seeing as every single one of this women were outstanding beauties, Qing Shui felt incomparably happy. He couldn’t help but be reminded of a phrase from his previous incarnations. That phrase was meant for people from ancient times.</p>
 <p>Being successful in business, and also with a large number of children and wives.</p>
 <p>There was nothing more which he could be unsatisfied with. In the past, he used to believe his ultimate goal to be toppling over Yan Clan to fight justice. But halfway through it, he ran into Di Chen, Yiye Jiange, Huoyun Liu-li, Lin Zhanhan and many more stuff. But certainly, he managed to know them quite well now.</p>
 <p>It’s not possible for him to stop knowing new people. Hence, following on, problems revolving around the Demon Lord begun to arise. Most importantly, the incident involving Yan Clan was yet to end. That person was still alive, hence, he mustn’t stop. Heck, even without such problem, he mustn’t.</p>
 <p>Because of Di Chen, he also wanted to travel to Western Oxhe Continent. It’s safe to assume that it would be very tough for him to accomplish his desire if he didn’t possess enough strength. The reason being that he couldn’t get to meet Di Chen in Lotus Sect.</p>
 <p>There were things which couldn’t be stopped once it has started. Hence, it’s best instead to try to finish it within your own capability so as to not leave any regrets for yourself and also the people around you.</p>
 <p>The Five Elements Divine Flag was extremely useful. Its use was something immeasurable.</p>
 <p>While conversing, Qing Shui slowly thought things through. With the Five Elements Divine Flag, Qing Shui no longer found it necessary for the people from Qing Clan to travel to Western Oxhe Continent. He might be leaving for the other three continents very soon.</p>
 <p>As this went down, they were still unable to catch up to his own footsteps. Since that was the case, wouldn’t it have been better if they stayed on the five continents?</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the Western Oxhe Continent would start to have a world of its own. As for the other three continents, it would just view the five continents as an infertile land. They didn’t even bat an eye at the Western Oxhe Continent. Normally, they wouldn’t leave the three continents as those places were rich and had abundant Spiritual Qi. From their perspective, it was a paradise in the human world. It was not something which could be compared to the five continents, much more the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>From Qing Shui’s perspective, the five continents weren’t that bad. Even though they were restricted by the laws of the Heaven and Earth, once they departed from it, they would naturally get significantly stronger. Their speed might be restricted, as that was a refining effect up to a certain extent. He felt that as long as he operated it well, it would just be the same across the nine continents.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui felt the need to discuss it with them now. After all, they were the few people who could go to the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>“Originally, I have said before that I want to get you guys to the other four continents within five years time. But now, I am going to tell you guys about the overall situation.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only went through it roughly. Actually, he could have told them everything. After all, there was no longer anyone from the Western Oxhe Continent who could hold him back. Despite this, he still only gave them a rough idea about it. It was mainly because he might leave the Western Oxhe Continent after five years time.</p>
 <p>Even if Qing Shui might have left, he could still come back to the five continents quite often, hence, they would naturally choose to stay here. Qing Shui had also promised them that he might be able to bring them along quite soon and that he would definitely let the entire family reunite.</p>
 <p>Now, everyone from the Qing Clan could at least achieve Xiantian Realm. Having a lifespan as long as 500 years could still be considered to be a lot. The lifespan of Xiantian Realm was still relatively real, and there were only very few unmentionable diseases and impurities. Hence, only the lifespan on the Xiantian Realm would be the most accurate. They had the time to wait. Furthermore, Qing Shui also guaranteed that it wouldn’t be that long.</p>
