He felt a cold feeling on his arm before a gush of blood splattered out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qing Shui was performing weakening techniques on his opponent, the other party made his move as well, causing his body's reaction to became stiff. That sword attack was aiming toward his chest, but thankfully, Qing Shui managed to dodge it. By now, Area Dominance had already removed the negative influence applied to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nuo Lan saw blood spurting out from Qing Shui's arm, she wanted to take action. However, Qing Shui tapped on his acupuncture points and stopped her. "It's fine now. Let me do it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea how strong Nuo Lan was, but if they were overly negligent, they could die. Qing Shui's Paragon Golden Armor allowed him to have one extra life. Even his defensive abilities were a lot stronger than Nuo Lan right now. However, the other party was very powerful and his weapon was also very abnormal. If he managed to strike the heart, without the Paragon Golden Armor, Qing Shui had the feeling that the other party's weapon would penetrate through very easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged black-robed man felt his body becoming very heavy and uncomfortable, and he had gotten a lot weaker as well. Despite so, he still felt that he wouldn't have many problems in killing this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui no longer held back and called out the Dragon Slaying Beast and Long Zhu`er. However, the other party also called out his own demonic beasts. There were three of them, and they were the same—three Golden Dragon Leopards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Leopards had a body length about ten meters and were completely covered in golden light. Their appearance looked like that of a leopard, but had a dragon's head. They had powerful energy and lightning speed with strengths that were around ten billion Dao force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt his body stiffened up, as if he had been locked on. This guy, working together with these three Golden Dragon Leopards, became like the sharpest sword. Not only did Qing Shui find them extremely hard to handle but even Nuo Lan felt very worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing which made Qing Shui felt better was that the Dragon Slaying Beast could weaken creatures' overall abilities by 20% if they had dragon's blood lineage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Powerful demonic beasts tended to have blood lineage of either dragons or phoenixes. Of course, it didn't mean that powerful demonic beasts must have the blood of either dragons or phoenixes in them, but dragons were lustful by nature and thus there were more demonic beasts with dragon's blood. Most ancient mutated species would have their own legacies, but there weren't many of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although many powerful species had become extinct, there would also be new mutated species appearing in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could have been products of evolutions, mutations, or were new specimens evolved after having obtained heavenly and earthly treasures. However, the formation of a new species would require time, and it was even more so for the passing down of a legacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Formations! Qing Shui added on weakening effects!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, his opponent made his move. A cold gleam shone in Qing Shui's eyes as he used the Buddha Bright Seal. A sharp glow then appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Weapon Flying Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Weapon Flying Sword was now at grade three. With a rapid flash, it pierced through the head of one of the Golden Dragon Leopards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flying Sword could become either big or small and when it penetrated through the Golden Dragon Leopard's head, it caused the Golden Dragon Leopard's head to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the Silver-Eyed Demon King who had been ready to attack suddenly narrowed and shuddered. Right now, Qing Shui's Divine Weapon Flying Sword was floating before Qing Shui, leaving behind only the Golden Dragon Leopard's which was still twitching. If it wasn't because its corpse was still around, he would have suspected if it was all just an illusion. Everything happened too quickly, so much so that it was unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't expected that the Divine Weapon Flying Sword at grade three would have the speed that was at least double of that when it was first forged. This made Qing Shui felt even more hopeful. If its grade were to continue to rise, after reaching grade 13, would it be able to kill everything in its way, including gods and demons?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following the sword, Long Zhu`er had started to attack. She spewed a stream of spider thread toward the other two Golden Dragon Leopards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Leopards were agile and they dodged with great flexibility. Qing Shui looked at the Silver-Eyed Demon King, not knowing if he should kill him now. However, Qing Shui didn't want to alert his enemies too soon. He didn't want to enter the situation where he would have to fight with the Demon Gate to the bitter end so early.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, it's best that we don't kill him. If the balance is thrown off, it won't be good. The Divine Palace is now a little weaker compared to the Demon Gate now." Nuo Lan said quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded and kept his Flying Sword. He looked at the black-robed man, "Silver-Eyed Demon King, I don't wish to kill you now. You better not appear before me anymore. Regardless if you believe it or not, killing you to me is as easy as killing a chicken."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of the Silver-Eyed Demon King's lips twitched and he felt like cursing. Having reached his age, this was the first time he had been compared to a chicken in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Nuo Lan, let's go. We'll check out other places." Qing Shui didn't care about that Silver-Eyed Demon King. He called back his demonic beasts, and then headed for the depths of the swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan walked next to Qing Shui, looking at him occasionally. How many more secrets did this guy have? Was that a Spirit Sword condensed from spiritual Qi? Could he already have reached the Spiritual Weapon Realm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Go ahead and speak up your mind. Don't hold it in." Qing Shui said without even turning his head. He knew that Nuo Lan would have many questions to ask after witnessing the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You've reached the Spiritual Weapon Realm?" Nuo Lan asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew about the Spiritual Weapon Realm. It was a Realm at the later phase of the Divine Grade. However, only 1% of the people would be able to attain this realm and even if they did, many people weren't able to reach a desirable prowess. However, it would still be a significant trump.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After reaching a certain level in the Spiritual Weapon Realm, one would be able to condense their Origin Qi into their own weapons, using spiritual sense to control their attacks. The condensed weapon would be able to destroy anything and its speed would be many times faster. It would also be able to neglect a certain amount of defensive abilities. Therefore, cultivators who had reached the Spiritual Weapon Realm would be able to go up against multiple opponents of the same level as themselves. Their opponents could potentially be instantly killed if they were careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was one downside. The depletion required to activate the Spiritual Weapon was especially great. Most people would use it as a final trump which aimed to kill the opponent the moment it appeared. Otherwise, with the great amount of depletion, most people would find it hard to activate it three times a day. It showed that even after having reached the Spiritual Weapon Realm, one might not be able to handle this rate of depletion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had used it once before and in principle, he would be able to use it for another one to two times. Of course, Qing Shui wasn't exactly sure how many times he could use it. He took note of his depletion when he was attacking so that it was at a rate that he could handle. He would have no problems attacking several tens of times. His Origin Qi storage was many times more than people of his level. Moreover, his depletion was reduced by about 10%. For other people, even if they were to have treasures or possessed heavenly techniques, they would only be able to use this for two to three times and their Origin Qi would be completely depleted after three times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were even people who could only use it once.</span></p>
