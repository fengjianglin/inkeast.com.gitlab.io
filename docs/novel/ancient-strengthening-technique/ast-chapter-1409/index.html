 <p><strong>AST 1409 - People from the Divine Sound Sect, Demoness, Eternal Spring Palace</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui's current abilities were strong enough, but he could still sense a powerful charm from the melody, a feeling that his heart and soul were being controlled.</p>
 <p>People from the Divine Sound Sect?</p>
 <p>A thought came to Qing Shui's mind. For one to be able to have such great achievements in music, it could only be someone from the Divine Sound Sect. The Divine Sound Sect was also one of the Four Great Evil Powers. Since he had found someone from the Divine Sound Sect, he should be able to find someone from the Demon Lord Palace!</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Qing Shui didn't hesitate anymore and rapidly dashed out toward the place where the sound was coming from.</p>
 <p>"Lass, you should join the few elder brothers on the bed to play that beautiful melody!"</p>
 <p>The closer Qing Shui got, he could hear a lascivious and evil melody, causing his brows to be tightly knitted together. He arrived at the scene very soon. Five ladies dressed in clothes that were white as snow were being surrounded by over 30 men. One of the ladies was in the middle, playing her zither nonstop. However, there were no signs of any war drums.</p>
 <p>"A bunch of hypocrites, only daring to reveal your lewd expressions in such an obsolete place. When my Eldest Martial Sister arrives, all of you will have to die." The lady continued to play her long zither, not even throwing a look in their direction as she played an elegant and transcendent melody.</p>
 <p>"It'd useless even if that demoness were to come. Our Eternal Spring Palace's Second Elder will be arriving soon as well. It'd be good for that demoness to come. We'll let our Second Elder take care of her." Saying this, the man laughed out loud lustfully.</p>
 <p>"Eternal Spring Palace is a lascivious and evil organization. Yet it can still have a spot in that so-called righteous league. This is really a joke."</p>
 <p>"We are trained in the Duo Cultivation Technique. Very soon, we'll be able to let you experience what it feels like to be in the seventh heaven. We'll guarantee that you'll never be able to leave us again."</p>
 <p>The man appeared to be middle-aged but Qing Shui knew that he was at least 200 years old but was just relying on Youth Retaining Arts.</p>
 <p>This was a handsome man with a tall and slender figure. However, his pair of amorous eyes were exuding a lewd glow. Anyone could tell what that gaze meant.</p>
 <p>"Eldest Martial Brother, let's not talk so much crap with them and just seize them to have some fun. In this god-forsaken place, even a female orangutan would appear beautiful."</p>
 <p>"Pffft, Sixth Brother, can you not sound so much like a beast?" One of the men couldn't hold it in and spurted out over the other man's face.</p>
 <p>"I'm just stating an analogy. All the ladies in the Divine Sound Sect are like beautiful flowers. We've really came across great fortune this time! I'm feeling the itch!"</p>
 <p>"Alright, let's break this Five Melody Supreme Formation first!"</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man in the middle exuded a faint glow from his amorous eyes. It was strange gaze that would make one feel unease. A pinkish Qi came out from his hands, condensing into a pink sword.</p>
 <p>"Righteous Qi Melody"</p>
 <p>When the lady saw the man's Peach Flower Sword Qi, she changed the melody on her zither and a righteous and seemingly indestructible Qi encompassed all five of them.</p>
 <p>Depressed Melody！</p>
 <p>The lady closed her eyes slightly, her long lashes twitched and she played out several music notes on her zither. Her fair forehead was filled with perspiration.</p>
 <p>"Everyone hang on. This lady won't be able to hang on for much longer. Once they're out of energy, we'll be able to seize them without any effort." The man depleted the ladies' endurance and spirit energy as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Several tens of people surrounded the few ladies, incessantly depleting their endurance. The ladies would be in danger if their defense were broken through.</p>
 <p>Just then, a figure came out from the distance. She was like a fairy gliding along in the air, with the speed of a shooting star.</p>
 <p>"Eldest Martial Brother, this is bad. That demoness is here."</p>
 <p>The man frowned but he quickly regained his composure, "Isn't that the Second Elder?"</p>
 <p>A thin, grey colored figure also appeared in the distant, rushing over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood in the far distance, watching as the two new figures quickly headed to join the people on each of their sides. Qing Shui couldn't tell the age of the lady. Under her pure and snow-white clothes, she had a wonderful and well-embodied figure. Her silhouette seemed a little similar to that of Yehuang Guwu and was very sexy. Her bone structure was well-proportioned and slender. Her curves were well-defined.</p>
 <p>Her lovely face was as beautiful as a drawing and was one that could draw out one's soul. Yehuang Guwu's attraction was more obscure but this lady's was a combination of obscurity and display. It was a high level attraction and wasn't just a superficial one. One would feel that her attraction was one that was very in-depth.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder that those people called her a demoness. She was someone who was like the most beautiful demoness and even Qing Shui felt that she looked like one. However, she was one that would keep people who weren't good enough away, a demoness of the highest quality, one who was polar opposites with a lady that was like a female saint.</p>
 <p>This lady wore a faint but extremely seductive smile that appeared natural at the same time. It wasn't one that seemed intentional. This was also one of the reasons why this lady exuded such a powerful seduction.</p>
 <p>"A bunch of garbage who thinks that you're righteous. All of you are just beasts wearing human hide. Do you know why you're revealing your true selves now?</p>
 <p>It's because you guys are real beasts and perverts. The demons in your hearts have caused you to reveal your true natures now. There would be one day that people like you would perversely end up getting yourselves killed."</p>
 <p>The lady's voice was very attractive and had a strange melodious feel to it. Furthermore, her gaze was one which would make one felt ashamed of themselves, as if they were neither good enough to be a good person nor a bad one.</p>
 <p>The Second Elder arrived and the men all greeted him respectfully. The old man's figure was short, at about 1.6 meters. Although he was very thin, he seemed to be tough as steel. He had a sorry look, with triangular shaped eyes, a big nose with rosacea and two big front teeth which made him seem like he had a rabbit's mouth.</p>
 <p>Although the heaven was very harsh on this old man's appearance, they had made it up to him in other areas. He had great talent and had the Three Yang Constitution.</p>
 <p>"I shall see how you people are going to run today. If you were to submit to us obediently, I'll assure your safety." The old man's voice was very sharp and a little piercing.</p>
 <p>"You people weren't able to do anything the previous time. What can you do this time around? If I wish to leave, which of you would be able to stop me?" the lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Your Soul Suppression Melody no longer has any effect," the old man smiled lewdly and said.</p>
 <p>"We don't know about that," the lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Take a look and see what this is."</p>
 <p>"The Grand Silent Buddha!" The lady said in astonishment and her beautiful brows were knitted together.</p>
 <p>"How about it? Will you submit to us? No matter what, you'll have to submit to us eventually. If you don't agree, you'll have to enjoy treatment that you wouldn't have dared to imagine. For example, snakes that like to find holes to slide into..."</p>
 <p>"With your appearance, you can't even be compared to a dog. It really puts me off. Otherwise, I would have considered following you." The lady revealed an extremely charming smile.</p>
 <p>The Second Elder's expression appeared worse than before. He had always been dissatisfied with his appearance. If not for the fact that he was very strong, everyone would probably look down on him. Right now, he was a great master and many people wouldn't touch on the topic of his appearance. There were also many ladies who were willing to follow him. He knew that they had other intentions for doing so but he was willing to live in his own world, as long as he was happy.</p>
 <p>Even though he knew well that this lady was saying this to spite him, he could not help but feel angry. He clenched down on his white protruding teeth. Martial arts cultivators weren't omnipotent. He could make himself appear youthful but couldn't really change his looks. He could change the structure of his bones for a short period of time, allowing his body to undergo slight changes to his weight and height. But this would only be temporary.</p>
 <p>"Later on, I'll let you know what it feels like to be half dead. With so many of us serving you, you'll definitely feel especially satisfied." A vicious glow flashed in the Second Elder's triangular eyes as he dashed out toward the lady.</p>
 <p>Soul Suppression Melody—Soul Suppression！</p>
 <p>The lady suddenly lifted up her hands and her pair of exquisite silver bracelets on her snow-white wrists started moving.</p>
 <p>A trembling sound of a cold voice that seemed as if it would make one's soul feel hollow rang out. It wasn't especially pleasant but it sounded so cold as if it came from a lonely ghost.</p>
 <p>The Grand Silent Buddha in the Second Elder's hand exuded a soft golden light which slowly encompassed the surroundings. It was as if spring had returned to the ground and sunlight was shining down. The dejected expressions all gradually disappeared.</p>
 <p>"I told you that with your cultivation and your Killing Melody won't be able to break through my Grand Silent Buddha. This thing can cause most of the people from your Divine Sound Sect to lose their battle prowess. Even yourself and the experts in your sect will suffer great impacts on your battle prowess," the Second Elder said proudly.</p>
 <p>"Don't be feeling happy too soon. The Divine Sound Sect isn't so easily dealt with. It's just a Grand Silent Buddha. We don't think much of it." After saying that, the lady took out a snow-white longsword which had many small mysterious holes. The way they were lined up was very strange.</p>
 <p>The lady made her move and managed to dodge the Eternal Spring Palace's Second Elder's grasp. The snow-white longsword in her hands pierced out toward the Second Elder's wrist abruptly like an agile snake.</p>
 <p>Squeak squeak!</p>
 <p>Two strange sharp sounds rang out, piercing his eardrums. The Grand Silent Buddha the old man was holding once again exuded a faint gold glow and he dodged the lady’s sound attack and then he charged out toward the lady at an even greater speed.</p>
 <p>Divine Melody Acceleration!</p>
 <p>The lady's hand swung once again and a melodious sound rang out. Her speed increased tremendously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's eyes lit up. The Divine Sound Sect had a strong mastery of music and music could stimulate one's potential. Music was very powerful. It could change a person's mood, stimulate potential and change one's disposition. There was more than one way of cultivation and as long as it was a suitable method, everyone could gain great achievements in their cultivation.</p>
 <p>Sound Demon！</p>
 <p>The lady's sword once again trembled a little and a snow-white silhouette appeared beside her. This was something that was similar to the protection from the White Tigers that Yehuang Guwu condensed. However, unlike the White Tigers. This particular one excelled in attacking one's spirit and it had about the same strength as the user. Although it looked very obscure, it could unleash some strange sounds and people with weak spirit energy would probably go crazy. Even those with decent spirit energy could receive disturbance and won't be able to focus their willpower.</p>
 <p>This thing could only use its spirit energy to attack and it required a lot of spirit energy.</p>
 <p>It was actually quite useful.</p>
 <p>Golden Buddha Light！</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Grand Silent Buddha exuded a powerful glow and landed on the Sound Demon, instantly causing it to disappear.</p>
 <p>Spring Comes Upon A Withered Tree!</p>
 <p>A powerful vitality came from the Second Elder and his palms turned into a shimmering dark green color. They looked very beautiful in this instant, like a work of art. It could greatly increase the user's tenacity, resistance, recovery, speed and endurance.</p>
 <p>Eternal Spring Palace's Duo Cultivation Technique couldn't be used in battle. All Duo Cultivation Techniques were just a means to increase one's strength and weren't meant to be used in fights.</p>
