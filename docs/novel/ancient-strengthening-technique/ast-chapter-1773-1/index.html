Yet, he was sure of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Muyun Qingge who was practising ceaselessly. His heart was calm and peaceful. A few days have passed since then, though he was unhappy with the issue of Vampiric Queen, he was slowly recovering now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stopped thinking further, there was too much trouble in life. Thus, it was unnecessary to create more troubles. Some things didn’t need to be done deliberately, once happened, it would progress on the right track by itself. It was the law of nature and Heavenly Dao, humans were incapable to change them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deliberate change would produce the opposite effect, only then would one realize that an intentional act brought the least desirable result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of that, Qing Shui felt relieved. To relax, he ought to loosen himself up. His mind was always tensed all these years, even now, he could not relax completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never expected to relax entirely. However, given the condition now, he could loosen up slightly and return. Qing Shui planned to strengthen his family, since he got a lot stronger now. As the saying stated, once a man became powerful, all his followers received his boon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

Half a month later, Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge were back at the Sunset Sea King Palace. They only took slightly more than a month’s time for a round trip, which was considered as quick as lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was greatly surprised by their return since it was too fast. Under normal circumstances, they should be on their way to the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave, but they were already back now……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange, Qing Hanye, and Luo Qingcheng were stunned to see Qing Shui. Still, they greeted two of them happily. Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge gave them a hug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, how was it?” Yiye Jiange asked worriedly. Although she was confident with Qing Shui, it was hard to be fully at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything went well,” Qing Shui nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye looked at Qing Shui unbelievably, “This is too soon, we’re just saying if you guys could reach the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave. Even if you’re quick, the furthest you could be is the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you trust me, when have I ever lied to you, also, I would not joke about Qingcheng’s issue.” Qing Shui smiled and said. Then, he took out the Sacred Mudra Flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At once, everybody believed him and did not question anymore. They were all extremely elated that Luo Qingcheng could be saved now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment, Qing Xiu woke up too. Yiye Jiange carried him out and Qing Shui immediately embraced him. They didn’t seem distant after a month being apart. The little guy looked energetic now, he didn’t seem shy with Qing Shui and recognized him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the little guy and then Yiye Jiange. Her training time was interrupted for the sake of this little guy. She disagreed to get a babysitter as this was her own child. She insisted to raise him by herself and didn’t mind to delay her training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very proud to have such an otherworldly and fairy-like woman to deliver and raise his own child……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was rather inappropriate to think this way, but Qing Shui felt absolutely proud and accomplished for that. If he had to choose between being the world’s most powerful man and having this woman, he would rather lose the title than to sacrifice this woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the Sacred Mudra Flower was found, it was not immediately usable and needed to be refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a lively moment and some drinks together, Qing Hanye, Muyun Qingge, and Luo Qingcheng were back to their rooms since they had a lot to share. After all, Qing Shui just returned and needed to enjoy the family bliss. Even Qing Hanye made a deal with Qing Shui, she pictured herself in Yiye Jiange’s situation and reckoned that Jiange would want some personal time with Qing Shui and her own child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange sat on the couch, holding on the little guy’s armpits while he moved up and down restlessly on her legs. Qing Shui squatted in front of them and played with Qing Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiange, let’s go back to the Qing Clan after some time,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange smiled, “I want to go back too. The little guy has already grown up but hasn’t met our parents yet,” Yiye Jiange accepted her identity to blend in this big family now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know you’re worried about this place, no worries, Qingge’s strength is more than enough to protect this place when we leave. Qingcheng and Hanye will also be here at that time, so rest assured.” Qing Shui knew Yiye Jiange worried about them here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can feel at ease, I would also trust you,” Yiye Jiange grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sat by Yiye Jiange’s side and held her shoulder, feeling exceptionally contented. He didn’t know his purpose of living in this world, but he had to ensure the people around him to lead a safe and happy life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Qing Shui’s goal. He had no magnificent ambitions and never thought of aspiring the world, he just wanted a better life for him and his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a norm for the others to pick fights even though you did not mean to start one. Some would want to degrade you for their own benefits if your existence was a threat to them. Hence, many things happened as a matter of course.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Sui thought of the women around him who were all remarkable beauties. At all times, women were troubles. Women were men’s pride and symbols of strength, a powerful man should be accompanied by pretty ladies. Conflicts were created instantly, once one discovered that a man weaker than himself was surrounded by women prettier than his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The source of conflict was a man’s greed and lust. Desires would propel a man to move forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was troublesome to have kids, Qing Shui felt restricted because of it now. However, it was not a nuisance. Qing Xiu fell asleep soundly under Qing Shui’s warm and gentle care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange blushed instantly as she saw Qing Shui’s action. She immediately understood what he intended to do after being apart for so long. Absence made hearts grow closer, it was a short separation period after one month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After settling his son, Qing Shui carried Yiye Jiange in his arms at once. He kissed her red moist lips while she was shivering lightly and then headed to another bedroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sweet, piteous, and tempting moan brought a chill down Qing Shui’s spine. The comforting excitement was beyond description. Warm and moist softness wrapped around Qing Shui. Looking at the blurred, mystical, and seductive face, Qing Shui got fired up instantly, this was many times stronger than any aphrodisiac.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The alluring noise in the room continued for two hours before it stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the intense activity, Yiye Jiange curled in Qing Shui’s embrace languidly. Her Attraction was so lethal when she was being timid and lovely.</span></p>
