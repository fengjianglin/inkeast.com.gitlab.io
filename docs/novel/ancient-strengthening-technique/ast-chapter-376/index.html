 <p><strong>Chapter 376 Reaping Great Returns, Faced Against a Powerful Great Demonic Beast, Suffering Great Setback Once Again.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 376 - Reaping Great Returns, Faced Against a Powerful Great Demonic Beast, Suffering Great Setback Once Again</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Then this is made from the hide of a demonic beast of at least Martial Saint level?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui got a shock from his thought. What sort of concept was a Martial Saint level demonic beast? There was not even a Martial Saint level cultivator in the whole Greencloud Continent. It would take at least 3 or more Martial Saint level cultivators to be able to kill one Martial Saint level demonic beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just the bag itself was made from a Martial Saint level beast... What kind of item would need to be contained in such a bag...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once the pouch was fished out of the water, it had immediately turned dry, without even a drop of water!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly opened it, and saw that there were two boxes: three small bottles and one piece of paper!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were a purple colored box, a silvery white colored box, and three snow white bottles and a piece of beast parchment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taking out the purple colored box, Qing Shui opened it. Immediately, Qing Shui could smell a tranquilizing scent as a pure gold colored medicinal pill the size of a pigeon's egg appeared before him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hmmm, there's words!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that there were words written on the lid of the box.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw the few words on the very top and quickly looked downwards. Just from the name along, he felt that this medicinal pill was not ordinary!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core, from the naturally mutated Pure Gold Mystic Turtle. Only a Pure Gold Mystic Turtle which had reached 8000 in years would be able to form the core, and it contained all the essence of a Pure Gold Mystic Turtle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effect: Increase individual's physical defence by threefolds, but only people who had extreme yang body could take it, and the person must be of at least Martial King level and cultivating Earth Elemental martial arts. Otherwise, they would explode from the overwhelming powers. Remember! Remember!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already numb. This Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core was as if it was specially made for him. While it had only one effect, it was already very strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three times the defence...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was heaven defying!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He thought about how even the Seven Star Armored Vest was only able to increase his physical defences by onefold, and only for one hour. Moreover, he could only use it once a day.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he were to take this Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core and then perform the Seven Star Armored Vest, then his defense... Just thinking about it make Qing Shui's blood boil.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A cockroach that was hard to kill...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he were to take this Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core, it would be no problem even if he were to meet the old man from yesterday. He would just need to go straight up against him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly, but unwillingly, closed the purple colored box.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And then, he opened the silvery white colored box!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Shui could smell a light, indistinct fragrance that was like the cooling wind. Qing Shui did not know what smell it was, but when he smell it, he felt as if a breeze was blowing into his face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a snow white colored medicinal pill which was the same size as the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core, crystal clear and extremely pure. After the experience with the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core, he immediately looked towards the lid of the box.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Greencloud Up-step Pellet!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He then looked on, and saw that the Greencloud Up-step Pellet was a top notch medicinal pill from Eastern Victory Divine Continent that allowed the user to gain progress very quickly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui started to feel a bit confused when he saw this. He did not understand what effect this medicinal pill had. The description was too generic. He decided not to think about it and continue to read on.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, there are actually effects too..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effect: It could raise all of the user's techniques by one level or one notch!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The requirement was for the person to be a cultivator of at least Martial King level. Then, martial techniques which have reached the Obscure Realm would not get any further increase! Martial arts in the great perfection stage would not improve either!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in a daze. What was this? It was heaven defying. Although there were many restrictions, the advantage was in "all", as in raising all of one's martial techniques by one level or by one notch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui agitatedly closed the box and looked towards the 3 snow white porcelain bottles. After opening them in sequence, he noticed that all three of them were golden pearls the size of soybeans. Their scents were not too obvious either, and they had a metallic feel.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were only about a hundred plus in all three bottles altogether!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After taking a look at the bottles, Qing Shui did not find anything. He could only put them carefully to the side. Qing Shui knew that these items would not lose out much to the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core and the Greencloud Up-step Pellet. It was a pity that he had no idea what they were.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turned his gaze to that special piece of paper.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui picked up the beast parchment, he was stunned!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Treasure map!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled the treasure map from the previous time. To think that he got another his hands on another. After taking a look, he could not recognize where the location of the treasure was and returned it into the pouch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After returning the items into the pouch, he threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Qing Shui at this moment was extremely satisfied. He looked at the Pure Gold Fishing Rod and lamented on how this was really a treasure. To think that it could bring him such a powerful item on the first use.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again casted the Pure Gold Fishing Rod into the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very slowly and Qing Shui did not dare to let his guard down. This place was rumored to be very mysterious and extremely dangerous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly Qing Shui wondered why there would be such powerful items in the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp. How could an ordinary person be able to have such powerful items? Seeing how he had fished them out from the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp was evidence that the person must be buried somewhere near.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that instant, cold sweat broke out on Qing Shui's back!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt as if there was wind blowing all around him, and it was very chilly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now knew that the greater the risk, the greater the returns. It was just like the situation now, when Qing Shui's senses had told him that he should leave immediately, there seemed to be another voice calling out for him to fish one more one. This time, he would definitely be able to get hold of even better and more powerful treasures.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was then when Qing Shui felt that he had caught something!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">So fast!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui made up his mind that no matter what it was, he would immediately chuck it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and simply leave.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that a majestic and overwhelming aura surging from the bottom of the lake. It was a pressure like that of a mountain's, and Qing Shui was extremely regretful on why he had not left earlier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Grabbing onto his fishing rod, Qing Shui quickly retreated. However, it was too late. Qing Shui could only see a gigantic black shadow flashing and charging towards him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was sent flying as he spewed out mouthfuls of blood. While he still had a bit of Spiritual Sense, he quickly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and immediately fell unconscious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui woke up, he wasn’t aware of how long it had been. Seeing that he was still in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he knew that not much time had passed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking outside through the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the world outside appeared extremely quiet. From the beginning to the end, Qing Shui did not know what had attacked him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moving his body, Qing Shui realized that he could not garner any strength, He shuddered at the thought of that majestic aura from earlier. Even Qing Shui was not able to estimate what level that "monster" was at.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But there was one thing which Qing Shui was very sure about. This monster was much stronger compared to the Palace Mistress of Misty Hall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall's Palace Mistress was at the pinnacle of Martial King, so this monster must be at least at the pinnacle of Martial King. It could even be one of those demonic beast at the Martial Saint level...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Having received that attack from earlier, Qing Shui felt as if all the bones throughout his body were smashed. This was so despite Qing Shui's extremely strong body. More importantly, since he was cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he had monstrous recovery skills. If it was someone else who had been inflicted with such heavy injuries, they would probably have been dead.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique circulating automatically in his body, and the image of Yin-Yang spinning very quickly in his consciousness. He felt that his body was slowly recovering.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui tried to lift up his arm bitterly and a layer of perspiration appeared on his forehead. His body was so itchy that it felt like ants were biting on it. Qing Shui clenched his teeth and bore with it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that this feeling was due to his body recovering and growing at a very quite rate!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were really a lot of unknown items and dangers in the world of the nine continents. Greencloud Continent was the weakest in the nine continents, and Cang Lang Country was almost the weakest in Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, in Cang Lang Country, the Hundred Miles City was the least eye-catching. Who would known that in the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp in Hundred Miles City, which no one had ever heard before, there would be such a powerful demonic beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about it bitterly. But then, he realized, if there was no such powerful demonic beast in the water, he would probably not have gotten his hands on this pouch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hmmm, pouch!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laid down on the ground and turned his head, discovering that the pouch was just right next to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He reached his hands for it but did not open it. He only felt it for a while before putting it down. He then gradually closed his eyes and started circulating his powers to heal his injured body and internal organs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could now sit up, and he bore with the excruciating pain as he circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One cycle, two cycles...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique gradually circulated, gently massaging his meridian channels, internal organs, bones, muscles...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui bore with the pain and could clearly felt his injuries gradually recovering!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Shui had suffered from the heaviest injuries he had even been through, and he had not even been able to see what had hurt him. He only knew that it was a big and black thing, and it was of the Martial King level at the very least.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After he had circulated a round of complete cycle, Qing Shui realized that his injuries were much better. After taking some food, he repeated one round of circulation of his Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While he was not in an excellent state, he could at least manage like a normal person now. Qing Shui knew that it would take at most three days to be fully recovered. However, he was afraid that he would be kicked out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at the very next moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he was kicked out in his current condition and came across that terrifying "demonic beast", he would absolutely have no chance of success.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He once again looked at the pouch which he had fished up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he was dead, he would have nothing left. Moreover, he would need to take them sooner or later. If he were to take them now, hopefully it would be able to help to suppress the imminent danger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moreover, he could not die yet. He had yet to head to Yan Clan! He still needed to crush Yan Clan. His mother had waited for twenty years. That lady in Yan City had also waited for ten years. Neither of them had given up, so how could he?!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gradually opened the pouch, and opened the purple colored box!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">It was a snow white colored medicinal pill which was the same size as the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core, crystal clear and extremely pure. After the experience with the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core, he immediately looked towards the lid of the box.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Greencloud Up-step Pellet!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He then looked on, and saw that the Greencloud Up-step Pellet was a top notch medicinal pill from Eastern Victory Divine Continent that allowed the user to gain progress very quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui started to feel a bit confused when he saw this. He did not understand what effect this medicinal pill had. The description was too generic. He decided not to think about it and continue to read on.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, there are actually effects too..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effect: It could raise all of the user's techniques by one level or one notch!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The requirement was for the person to be a cultivator of at least Martial King level. Then, martial techniques which have reached the Obscure Realm would not get any further increase! Martial arts in the great perfection stage would not improve either!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in a daze. What was this? It was heaven defying. Although there were many restrictions, the advantage was in "all", as in raising all of one's martial techniques by one level or by one notch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui agitatedly closed the box and looked towards the 3 snow white porcelain bottles. After opening them in sequence, he noticed that all three of them were golden pearls the size of soybeans. Their scents were not too obvious either, and they had a metallic feel.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were only about a hundred plus in all three bottles altogether!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After taking a look at the bottles, Qing Shui did not find anything. He could only put them carefully to the side. Qing Shui knew that these items would not lose out much to the Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core and the Greencloud Up-step Pellet. It was a pity that he had no idea what they were.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turned his gaze to that special piece of paper.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui picked up the beast parchment, he was stunned!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Treasure map!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled the treasure map from the previous time. To think that he got another his hands on another. After taking a look, he could not recognize where the location of the treasure was and returned it into the pouch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After returning the items into the pouch, he threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Qing Shui at this moment was extremely satisfied. He looked at the Pure Gold Fishing Rod and lamented on how this was really a treasure. To think that it could bring him such a powerful item on the first use.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again casted the Pure Gold Fishing Rod into the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very slowly and Qing Shui did not dare to let his guard down. This place was rumored to be very mysterious and extremely dangerous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly Qing Shui wondered why there would be such powerful items in the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp. How could an ordinary person be able to have such powerful items? Seeing how he had fished them out from the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp was evidence that the person must be buried somewhere near.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that instant, cold sweat broke out on Qing Shui's back!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt as if there was wind blowing all around him, and it was very chilly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now knew that the greater the risk, the greater the returns. It was just like the situation now, when Qing Shui's senses had told him that he should leave immediately, there seemed to be another voice calling out for him to fish one more one. This time, he would definitely be able to get hold of even better and more powerful treasures.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was then when Qing Shui felt that he had caught something!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">So fast!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui made up his mind that no matter what it was, he would immediately chuck it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and simply leave.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that a majestic and overwhelming aura surging from the bottom of the lake. It was a pressure like that of a mountain's, and Qing Shui was extremely regretful on why he had not left earlier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Grabbing onto his fishing rod, Qing Shui quickly retreated. However, it was too late. Qing Shui could only see a gigantic black shadow flashing and charging towards him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was sent flying as he spewed out mouthfuls of blood. While he still had a bit of Spiritual Sense, he quickly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and immediately fell unconscious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui woke up, he wasn’t aware of how long it had been. Seeing that he was still in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he knew that not much time had passed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking outside through the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the world outside appeared extremely quiet. From the beginning to the end, Qing Shui did not know what had attacked him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moving his body, Qing Shui realized that he could not garner any strength, He shuddered at the thought of that majestic aura from earlier. Even Qing Shui was not able to estimate what level that "monster" was at.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But there was one thing which Qing Shui was very sure about. This monster was much stronger compared to the Palace Mistress of Misty Hall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall's Palace Mistress was at the pinnacle of Martial King, so this monster must be at least at the pinnacle of Martial King. It could even be one of those demonic beast at the Martial Saint level...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Having received that attack from earlier, Qing Shui felt as if all the bones throughout his body were smashed. This was so despite Qing Shui's extremely strong body. More importantly, since he was cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he had monstrous recovery skills. If it was someone else who had been inflicted with such heavy injuries, they would probably have been dead.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique circulating automatically in his body, and the image of Yin-Yang spinning very quickly in his consciousness. He felt that his body was slowly recovering.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui tried to lift up his arm bitterly and a layer of perspiration appeared on his forehead. His body was so itchy that it felt like ants were biting on it. Qing Shui clenched his teeth and bore with it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that this feeling was due to his body recovering and growing at a very quite rate!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were really a lot of unknown items and dangers in the world of the nine continents. Greencloud Continent was the weakest in the nine continents, and Cang Lang Country was almost the weakest in Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, in Cang Lang Country, the Hundred Miles City was the least eye-catching. Who would known that in the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp in Hundred Miles City, which no one had ever heard before, there would be such a powerful demonic beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about it bitterly. But then, he realized, if there was no such powerful demonic beast in the water, he would probably not have gotten his hands on this pouch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hmmm, pouch!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laid down on the ground and turned his head, discovering that the pouch was just right next to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He reached his hands for it but did not open it. He only felt it for a while before putting it down. He then gradually closed his eyes and started circulating his powers to heal his injured body and internal organs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could now sit up, and he bore with the excruciating pain as he circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One cycle, two cycles...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique gradually circulated, gently massaging his meridian channels, internal organs, bones, muscles...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui bore with the pain and could clearly felt his injuries gradually recovering!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Shui had suffered from the heaviest injuries he had even been through, and he had not even been able to see what had hurt him. He only knew that it was a big and black thing, and it was of the Martial King level at the very least.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After he had circulated a round of complete cycle, Qing Shui realized that his injuries were much better. After taking some food, he repeated one round of circulation of his Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While he was not in an excellent state, he could at least manage like a normal person now. Qing Shui knew that it would take at most three days to be fully recovered. However, he was afraid that he would be kicked out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at the very next moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he was kicked out in his current condition and came across that terrifying "demonic beast", he would absolutely have no chance of success.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He once again looked at the pouch which he had fished up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he was dead, he would have nothing left. Moreover, he would need to take them sooner or later. If he were to take them now, hopefully it would be able to help to suppress the imminent danger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moreover, he could not die yet. He had yet to head to Yan Clan! He still needed to crush Yan Clan. His mother had waited for twenty years. That lady in Yan City had also waited for ten years. Neither of them had given up, so how could he?!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gradually opened the pouch, and opened the purple colored box!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core!</p>
