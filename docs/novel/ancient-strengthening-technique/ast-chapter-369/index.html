 <p><strong>Chapter 369 Cold Yet Sultry, Shi Clan Has A Xiantian Now, Too.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>369 - Cold Yet Sultry, Shi Clan Has A Xiantian Now, Too</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you here?” Shi Qingzhuang stood up and questioned Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am here to visit my lovely wife!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During this visit, Qing Shui realized that Shi Qingzhuang had been showing him a lot more smiles than she did before. She would smile a bit more whenever she saw him, and also in front of his mother and the people of Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This made Qing Shui extremely happy and he loved her even deeper. As they say, love the house and its crow [1]. Qing Shui knew that she was doing all this because of him. He had never seen her smiling like this in front of anyone else or even her own parents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Stop joking around!” Shi Qingzhuang told Qing Shui, as if reprimanding him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was a little dumbfounded from her lovable and tempting charm. Although Qing Shui wasn’t really unbridled in front of her, he could be considered as quite shameless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had shared an intimate moment with her once by mistake in the past, though it was being “forced by circumstances”. But when he visited her after that incident, he kissed her again once and that one kiss had proven a lot of things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A blush that appeared on her cheeks as Qing Shui stared at her. She lowered her head slightly and crossed her arms in front of her chest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was happily looking at Shi Qingzhuang’s cold but currently “tender and beautiful” countenance. His heart was slightly moved, and a thought emerged within him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was his woman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How does it count as a joke? We are engaged. You being my wife is a reality that can be proved by many others. Do you still intend to run away?” Qing Shui tenderly pulled on her hands and chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You’ve become naughty.” Shi Qingzhuang let Qing Shui pulled her as she raised the “cold face” that belonged to her and looked at Qing Shui with a small smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, I’ll help you breakthrough Xiantian today!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words shocked Shi Qingzhuang. Although she knew that this day would come, she just didn’t expect it to be this soon. Qing He’s breakthrough was known by almost everyone in the Hundred Miles City. It was something that you can’t hide even if you wanted. At that time she wondered if Qing Shui would help her break through and she was even embarrassed about it because she realized that she would unconsciously think about him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang did consider letting Qing Shui help her in entering Xiantian before, but she just didn’t want to approach him. According to her personality, she would never be the one to take the initiative in approaching Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui…..” Shi Qingzhuang wanted to say something but she swallowed her words. She felt very conflicted. If she accepted Qing Shui’s assistance today, it would cause some changes in the relationship between them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was an enormous favor. She had actually always been thinking about one thing, did Qing Shui engage with her because he wanted to take the responsibility over what had happened during that time?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, I know that your heart is not with me right now and I don’t know where your heart is either. But let me tell you this, I will not let you go so easily and our relationship has nothing to do with other things.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang was his fiancée now. He would not let her go so easily. On top of that, Shi Qingzhuang had promised to Qing Shui that she only needed some time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words were clear. Nothing else shall come in between them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang thought for a while after listening to his words. Perhaps she had come to realize something, she smiled at Qing Shui. That smile was brimming with a kind of feeling that could bring comfort to people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had already thought it over!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since the moment she met Qing Shui when she was drugged, their fates were destined to intertwine with each other. Moreover, she didn’t hate this young man. Although she wasn’t really in love with him, there was still some infatuation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang nodded at Qing Shui, the wonderful feeling of this moment made her heart beat a little. Looking at Qing Shui had suddenly calmed her down. For the first time, she had a sense of security.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go to your room, we’ll begin!” Qing Shui pulled her towards the bedroom.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang knew Qing Shui’s words didn’t mean that way, but they still made her a little shy. At the same time, the memories of the past came flooding back to her, making her lower her head in embarrassment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that this was the first time he had entered Shi Qingzhuang’s room. Her room was decorated just like her, in the same fiery red color! It had only a small living room and a bedroom.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The living room had only a long fiery red sofa and a fiery red colored tea table. Qing Shui looked at the fiery red clothes that Shi Qingzhuang was wearing and thought that she would look stunning if she sat in this fiery red colored sofa!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cold and alluring!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had discovered that Shi Qingzhuang and Huoyun Liu-Li were the same. Shi Qingzhuang was fond of fiery red color. He could tell from her fiery red Emberlion Steed, her fiery red clothes, to her fiery red room, fiery red sofa and fiery red tea table. While Huoyun Liu-Li was fond of violet color.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What do I need to do?” Shi Qingzhuang asked softly upon her arrival at the room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You don’t need to do anything. I just need to help you clear all the acupoints and meridians in your entire body!” Qing Shui said with a smile after a short hesitation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang saw his hesitation and looked at him seriously. She clenched her pearly white teeth in the end and nodded at him as a sign of silent approval.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are we doing it in the bedroom or on this sofa……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The bedroom will be more comfortable…..”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words temporarily rendered her speechless. She rolled her eyes at the awkwardly laughing Qing Shui before she led him towards her bedroom. Qing Shui trailed after her, feeling very content looking at the wonderful figure walking closely in front of him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As soon as they entered the bedroom, he smiled at the sight of a fiery red bed and a group of fiery red cabinets in the room. He observed that there was nothing else in the room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the blanket on the fiery red bed was fiery red colored, too. Qing Shui didn’t particularly hate nor like red. He had only discovered the fact that red could actually look this beautiful too after meeting Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing Qing Shui staring blankly at the bed and the sheets on the bed, Shi Qingzhuang was a little embarrassed. She thought that he was recalling about the love making between them before, and it was on the very same bed that time……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Stop thinking about it……” Shi Qingzhuang extended her arm and tugged on his sleeves.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was surprised for a moment and laughed wryly. He wasn’t thinking of anything, but her reminder ironically made him recall the exquisite scene at that time. He looked at the cold beauty standing before him shyly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He summoned his courage and gently put his arms around Shi Qingzhuang’s slim waist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pulled her into a gentle embrace, and didn’t do anything else as he was afraid to frighten her. Holding her in his arms, he wanted to indulge in the same warmth that he had felt before the most right now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang didn’t move and only lifted her beautiful cold face that drove men crazy. A small smile graced her lips after seeing an intoxicating smile and infatuation in Qing Shui’s eyes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui softly pressed his forehead against hers. His nose was touching the delicate tip of her sharp and fair nose as they rubbed against each other gently!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I really missed you a lot!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They weren’t some honeyed words and Qing Shui also didn’t know how to talk sweet nothings to someone. However, this statement made Shi Qingzhuang feel a trace of warmth. The feeling that Qing Shui was trying to convey had reached her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hm!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wasn’t sure if the soft noise that Shi Qingzhuang emitted through her nose was a response or an unconscious sound.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He slowly released her then hoisted up by her waist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah, what are you doing!?” she yelped in surprise!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Going up the bed? Or else how are we going to begin?” Qing Shui put her down on the bed with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shizhuang knew that she had misunderstood his intention. She thought back about her surprised yelp from just now, she was angry about what he did to her yet at the same time also angry at herself for being unable to remain calm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do we start from the front or the back?” Qing Shui felt that his question was a little ambiguous yet a little familiar at the same time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The last time he helped to massage Huoyun Liu-Li was kind of like this, too!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang didn’t answer but she turned around, burying her beautiful face into the sheets.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt extremely special inside his heart to have a cold beauty lying on her stomach in front of him. Although he had indulged in her body before, her heart didn’t belong to him. She was now his fiancée, but they never made love to each other again after that time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She laid there on the bed, that beautiful and graceful figure of her was jawdroppingly stunning. Her lithe body had a beautiful outline, and her chiseled shoulders were indescribably sexy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her delicate legs were long and straight, her buttocks were full and perky, and the curves of her hips were extremely alluring!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on the side of the bed as he tried to calm his heart down. He slowly stretched his hands out, they were gradually turning transparent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Saintly Hands!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could feel Shi Qingzhuang’s exquisite and delicate body quiver the moment both of his hands landed on her shoulders.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Zhongfu, Yunmen acupoints!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hands gently pressed on those two acupoints. His middle finger rapidly flicked on the acupoints a few times before he slowly pressed and kneaded with his palms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tianzhu, Fufen, Feishu, Xinshu, Shengshu…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui worked on the major acupoints on her back, especially the ones along her spinal cord. His hands fluttered over them like a butterfly, making Shi Qingzhuang who had been quivering to go slightly weak and limp now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang who had her face buried in the sheets clenched her teeth tightly, trying hard to suppress her moans. She could feel that she was going out of control. The sensation on her back could make even her bones to go limp.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shangliao, Huiyang, Zhibian, Chengfu.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s palms landed on these four acupoints after hesitating for awhile!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang’s limp body tensed up within an instant, and a soft moan escaped between her lips!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The previous four acupoints were all located on the buttocks while the latter four were even more sensitive. Her tensed up body and her soft moan made Qing Shui’s hand tremble and land in between her butt crack.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soft and numb…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang clasped her hands over her mouth tightly as she turned around and sat up. Her face was as red as a tomato and she didn’t dare to look at Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her silence stretched on, so Qing Shui had no choice but to go over the issue with her. After all, doing this could raise the chances of reaching Xiantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He saw that Shi Qingzhuang still remained silent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We’re already husband and wife, do you need to be this shy? We still have even more embarrassing things to do on the night of our wedding…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t say anything further!” Shi Qingzhuang covered his mouth with her hand. Although they had indeed done what a husband and wife should, she was unconscious that time. However, it wasn’t like that now. She felt extremely awkward whenever he talked about things that they would do after they get married.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By the time he completed his task, his hands were full of a sweet smelling fragrance. He had pretty much touched every inch of Shi Qingzhuang’s body, especially when he was “caressing” her entire body lovingly while watching the cold yet sultry shyness of the cold beauty. This made Qing Shui feel like it was as if they were making love.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Plum Blossom Wine!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Natural Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui’s first experience, he was more proficient at it this time round. Most importantly, Shi Qingzhuang’s strength was already at the peak of Houtian and on top of that, she had quite a strong perception.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left the bedroom when Shi Qingzhuang had entered into the state. He walked out from the room and sat down on the couch that she sometimes sat on before shutting his eyes to recuperate.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Not long after that, the Old Master of Shi Clan arrived but Qing Shui told him not to disturb Qingzhuang. His eyes were as bright as the stars in the sky when she was cultivating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He knew about Qing He’s breakthrough. Both Qing Luo and him had remained at the peak of Houtian for a few decades, and his granddaughter, Shi Qingzhuang, was at the peak of Houtian as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had been wanting to talk to Qing Shui and see if he could help Shi Qingzhuang to breakthrough to Xiantian because he no longer had any faith in himself to break through for a long time now. But he restrained himself, he didn’t know should he ask for help or not.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But he could feel it today, and at the same time knew that he had done the right thing. He was also glad that his own granddaughter had found such a good man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Qing Shui!” Old Master Shi was extremely happy and expressed his sincere gratitude.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You’re welcome, we are a family!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just right at this moment, a familiar mighty aura was in the air. He knew that Shi Qingzhuang had broke through and could come out very soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Old Master of Shi Clan looked at Qing Shui, unable to speak from being overwhelmed. His Shi Clan has a Xiantian now, too... His Shi Clan has a Xiantian now, too…!!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">He had shared an intimate moment with her once by mistake in the past, though it was being “forced by circumstances”. But when he visited her after that incident, he kissed her again once and that one kiss had proven a lot of things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A blush that appeared on her cheeks as Qing Shui stared at her. She lowered her head slightly and crossed her arms in front of her chest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was happily looking at Shi Qingzhuang’s cold but currently “tender and beautiful” countenance. His heart was slightly moved, and a thought emerged within him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was his woman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How does it count as a joke? We are engaged. You being my wife is a reality that can be proved by many others. Do you still intend to run away?” Qing Shui tenderly pulled on her hands and chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You’ve become naughty.” Shi Qingzhuang let Qing Shui pulled her as she raised the “cold face” that belonged to her and looked at Qing Shui with a small smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, I’ll help you breakthrough Xiantian today!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words shocked Shi Qingzhuang. Although she knew that this day would come, she just didn’t expect it to be this soon. Qing He’s breakthrough was known by almost everyone in the Hundred Miles City. It was something that you can’t hide even if you wanted. At that time she wondered if Qing Shui would help her break through and she was even embarrassed about it because she realized that she would unconsciously think about him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang did consider letting Qing Shui help her in entering Xiantian before, but she just didn’t want to approach him. According to her personality, she would never be the one to take the initiative in approaching Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui…..” Shi Qingzhuang wanted to say something but she swallowed her words. She felt very conflicted. If she accepted Qing Shui’s assistance today, it would cause some changes in the relationship between them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was an enormous favor. She had actually always been thinking about one thing, did Qing Shui engage with her because he wanted to take the responsibility over what had happened during that time?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, I know that your heart is not with me right now and I don’t know where your heart is either. But let me tell you this, I will not let you go so easily and our relationship has nothing to do with other things.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang was his fiancée now. He would not let her go so easily. On top of that, Shi Qingzhuang had promised to Qing Shui that she only needed some time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words were clear. Nothing else shall come in between them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang thought for a while after listening to his words. Perhaps she had come to realize something, she smiled at Qing Shui. That smile was brimming with a kind of feeling that could bring comfort to people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had already thought it over!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ever since the moment she met Qing Shui when she was drugged, their fates were destined to intertwine with each other. Moreover, she didn’t hate this young man. Although she wasn’t really in love with him, there was still some infatuation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang nodded at Qing Shui, the wonderful feeling of this moment made her heart beat a little. Looking at Qing Shui had suddenly calmed her down. For the first time, she had a sense of security.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go to your room, we’ll begin!” Qing Shui pulled her towards the bedroom.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang knew Qing Shui’s words didn’t mean that way, but they still made her a little shy. At the same time, the memories of the past came flooding back to her, making her lower her head in embarrassment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that this was the first time he had entered Shi Qingzhuang’s room. Her room was decorated just like her, in the same fiery red color! It had only a small living room and a bedroom.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The living room had only a long fiery red sofa and a fiery red colored tea table. Qing Shui looked at the fiery red clothes that Shi Qingzhuang was wearing and thought that she would look stunning if she sat in this fiery red colored sofa!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cold and alluring!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had discovered that Shi Qingzhuang and Huoyun Liu-Li were the same. Shi Qingzhuang was fond of fiery red color. He could tell from her fiery red Emberlion Steed, her fiery red clothes, to her fiery red room, fiery red sofa and fiery red tea table. While Huoyun Liu-Li was fond of violet color.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What do I need to do?” Shi Qingzhuang asked softly upon her arrival at the room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You don’t need to do anything. I just need to help you clear all the acupoints and meridians in your entire body!” Qing Shui said with a smile after a short hesitation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang saw his hesitation and looked at him seriously. She clenched her pearly white teeth in the end and nodded at him as a sign of silent approval.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are we doing it in the bedroom or on this sofa……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The bedroom will be more comfortable…..”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words temporarily rendered her speechless. She rolled her eyes at the awkwardly laughing Qing Shui before she led him towards her bedroom. Qing Shui trailed after her, feeling very content looking at the wonderful figure walking closely in front of him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As soon as they entered the bedroom, he smiled at the sight of a fiery red bed and a group of fiery red cabinets in the room. He observed that there was nothing else in the room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the blanket on the fiery red bed was fiery red colored, too. Qing Shui didn’t particularly hate nor like red. He had only discovered the fact that red could actually look this beautiful too after meeting Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing Qing Shui staring blankly at the bed and the sheets on the bed, Shi Qingzhuang was a little embarrassed. She thought that he was recalling about the love making between them before, and it was on the very same bed that time……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Stop thinking about it……” Shi Qingzhuang extended her arm and tugged on his sleeves.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was surprised for a moment and laughed wryly. He wasn’t thinking of anything, but her reminder ironically made him recall the exquisite scene at that time. He looked at the cold beauty standing before him shyly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He summoned his courage and gently put his arms around Shi Qingzhuang’s slim waist!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pulled her into a gentle embrace, and didn’t do anything else as he was afraid to frighten her. Holding her in his arms, he wanted to indulge in the same warmth that he had felt before the most right now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang didn’t move and only lifted her beautiful cold face that drove men crazy. A small smile graced her lips after seeing an intoxicating smile and infatuation in Qing Shui’s eyes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui softly pressed his forehead against hers. His nose was touching the delicate tip of her sharp and fair nose as they rubbed against each other gently!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I really missed you a lot!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They weren’t some honeyed words and Qing Shui also didn’t know how to talk sweet nothings to someone. However, this statement made Shi Qingzhuang feel a trace of warmth. The feeling that Qing Shui was trying to convey had reached her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hm!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wasn’t sure if the soft noise that Shi Qingzhuang emitted through her nose was a response or an unconscious sound.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He slowly released her then hoisted up by her waist!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah, what are you doing!?” she yelped in surprise!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Going up the bed? Or else how are we going to begin?” Qing Shui put her down on the bed with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shizhuang knew that she had misunderstood his intention. She thought back about her surprised yelp from just now, she was angry about what he did to her yet at the same time also angry at herself for being unable to remain calm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do we start from the front or the back?” Qing Shui felt that his question was a little ambiguous yet a little familiar at the same time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The last time he helped to massage Huoyun Liu-Li was kind of like this, too!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang didn’t answer but she turned around, burying her beautiful face into the sheets.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt extremely special inside his heart to have a cold beauty lying on her stomach in front of him. Although he had indulged in her body before, her heart didn’t belong to him. She was now his fiancée, but they never made love to each other again after that time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She laid there on the bed, that beautiful and graceful figure of her was jawdroppingly stunning. Her lithe body had a beautiful outline, and her chiseled shoulders were indescribably sexy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her delicate legs were long and straight, her buttocks were full and perky, and the curves of her hips were extremely alluring!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on the side of the bed as he tried to calm his heart down. He slowly stretched his hands out, they were gradually turning transparent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Saintly Hands!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could feel Shi Qingzhuang’s exquisite and delicate body quiver the moment both of his hands landed on her shoulders.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Zhongfu, Yunmen acupoints!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hands gently pressed on those two acupoints. His middle finger rapidly flicked on the acupoints a few times before he slowly pressed and kneaded with his palms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tianzhu, Fufen, Feishu, Xinshu, Shengshu…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui worked on the major acupoints on her back, especially the ones along her spinal cord. His hands fluttered over them like a butterfly, making Shi Qingzhuang who had been quivering to go slightly weak and limp now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang who had her face buried in the sheets clenched her teeth tightly, trying hard to suppress her moans. She could feel that she was going out of control. The sensation on her back could make even her bones to go limp.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shangliao, Huiyang, Zhibian, Chengfu.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s palms landed on these four acupoints after hesitating for awhile!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang’s limp body tensed up within an instant, and a soft moan escaped between her lips!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The previous four acupoints were all located on the buttocks while the latter four were even more sensitive. Her tensed up body and her soft moan made Qing Shui’s hand tremble and land in between her butt crack.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soft and numb…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang clasped her hands over her mouth tightly as she turned around and sat up. Her face was as red as a tomato and she didn’t dare to look at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her silence stretched on, so Qing Shui had no choice but to go over the issue with her. After all, doing this could raise the chances of reaching Xiantian.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He saw that Shi Qingzhuang still remained silent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We’re already husband and wife, do you need to be this shy? We still have even more embarrassing things to do on the night of our wedding…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t say anything further!” Shi Qingzhuang covered his mouth with her hand. Although they had indeed done what a husband and wife should, she was unconscious that time. However, it wasn’t like that now. She felt extremely awkward whenever he talked about things that they would do after they get married.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By the time he completed his task, his hands were full of a sweet smelling fragrance. He had pretty much touched every inch of Shi Qingzhuang’s body, especially when he was “caressing” her entire body lovingly while watching the cold yet sultry shyness of the cold beauty. This made Qing Shui feel like it was as if they were making love.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Plum Blossom Wine!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Natural Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui’s first experience, he was more proficient at it this time round. Most importantly, Shi Qingzhuang’s strength was already at the peak of Houtian and on top of that, she had quite a strong perception.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left the bedroom when Shi Qingzhuang had entered into the state. He walked out from the room and sat down on the couch that she sometimes sat on before shutting his eyes to recuperate.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Not long after that, the Old Master of Shi Clan arrived but Qing Shui told him not to disturb Qingzhuang. His eyes were as bright as the stars in the sky when she was cultivating.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He knew about Qing He’s breakthrough. Both Qing Luo and him had remained at the peak of Houtian for a few decades, and his granddaughter, Shi Qingzhuang, was at the peak of Houtian as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had been wanting to talk to Qing Shui and see if he could help Shi Qingzhuang to breakthrough to Xiantian because he no longer had any faith in himself to break through for a long time now. But he restrained himself, he didn’t know should he ask for help or not.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But he could feel it today, and at the same time knew that he had done the right thing. He was also glad that his own granddaughter had found such a good man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Qing Shui!” Old Master Shi was extremely happy and expressed his sincere gratitude.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You’re welcome, we are a family!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just right at this moment, a familiar mighty aura was in the air. He knew that Shi Qingzhuang had broke through and could come out very soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Old Master of Shi Clan looked at Qing Shui, unable to speak from being overwhelmed. His Shi Clan has a Xiantian now, too... His Shi Clan has a Xiantian now, too…!!</p>
