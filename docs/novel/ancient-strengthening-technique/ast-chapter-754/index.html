 <p><strong>AST 754 - The strength of Southern Viewing Continent, the powerful Eastern Palace Clan</strong></p>
 <p>Upon seeing the girl, Ye Yan ignored everything. She ran towards her and hugged her tightly.</p>
 <p>“Sister……”</p>
 <p>Even though Ye Yan has been away for a few years, there weren’t many changes to her face. Despite her significant height increase, people who were familiar with her would still be able to tell that it was her.</p>
 <p>The two girls hugged each other tightly for a long time. Ye Yan constantly called out to her sister. The kind of excitement and concern they had for each other were all expressed fully without any holding back.</p>
 <p>“Yan`er, where have you been for the past three years? Who brought you away?”</p>
 <p>After they finally calmed down, the woman looked at Ye Yan with her slightly knitted brows. Her pleasant voice sounded extremely pressuring. Even though she sounded really calm when she said it, it was still fairly easy to see that she was furious.</p>
 <p>“Wu Clan from Deep Sea City, they were the ones who brought me away. If I hadn’t run into uncles, I wouldn’t have ever been able to meet you.” Ye Yan said as she pointed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>It was as if the girl only saw Qing Shui now. After that, she pulled Ye Yan and went towards Qing Shui along with the ten elderly men behind her. The closer she went, the more shocked she looked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was just as shocked as he looked at the girl. The reason being that the girl’s strength…… The girl whose age he was unable to tell… The girl with an exceptionally beautiful face which lay in between that of a girl and a woman… Actually possessed strength that worth three stars...</p>
 <p>This was the strongest person Qing Shui has ever seen from the younger generations so far. The girl on the other hand, she could feel that Qing Shui was a mysterious man, causing her to feel a bit unreal when she looked at him.</p>
 <p>Originally, she thought that the strongest person here was Cang Wuya. But it turned out she found that the ability of the people at the back were barely average. However, they were no longer at a standard where people of her cultivation realm where placed in their eyes.</p>
 <p>However, things were different for the young man standing in front of her. The young man’s face looked really delicate and handsome. The mark on his forehead looked really bewitching. It had a fatal charm to it. His eyes however, looked incomparably tranquil and clear, making people feel many times closer with each other.</p>
 <p>This was a man who she wasn’t able to see through. Not only was he really young, it seemed like he possessed tremendous strength. She wasn't able to tell clearly but she had a feeling that it would be hard for her to win if she was to go against him.</p>
 <p>Even though her strength was considered quite average in Southern Viewing Continent, there were still fairly quite a lot of people who has beaten her before. But because of her age, no one would try to pick on Ye Clan, reason being that they’re concerned for their own future.</p>
 <p>Among the younger generations, she knew two people who made her felt really impressed. One was Donggong Taiqing from Donggong Clan. He was already the main support for Donggong Clan. He was one of the strongest warriors in his clan.</p>
 <p>The other one was Tantai Xuan from Tantai Aristocrat Clan. Even though she hadn't met her in person, her reputation was spread all over the continent. Not only that, she even got the World Cleansing Demonic Lotus .There was no longer anyone among the younger generation who could be like her.</p>
 <p>The young man in front of her right now gave her a really strange feeling. She smiled, walked up to Qing Shui and bowed: “my name is Ye Guyan. Thank you for saving my sister.”</p>
 <p>“No worries. If it's just a small thing.” Qing Shui quickly tried to escape.</p>
 <p>“Brother and seniors, please come in to Ye Clan to allow us to return you the favor. Ye Guyan smiled as she saw Qing Shui’s action. She let them entered Ye Clan.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, Grandpa Cang, you guys have to stay in Ye Clan for a few days.” Ye Yan said as she pulled both Qing Shui and Cang Wuya.</p>
 <p>“Sorry for the trouble then.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>They greeted each other politely and proceeded towards Ye Clan. Along the way, Ye Yan constantly held Ye Guyan’s arm with one hand and Qing Shui’s hand with the other. One was the most important person to her, her sister, while the other one was the person who saved her and gave her a second chance to live. Hence, she who only had two hands used both to pull the two most important people to her.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan never expected Ye Yan would call him Uncle Qing. She shared the same position in family as her sister. Previously, she originally wanted to address him as senior, but she eventually still settled down with calling him brother.</p>
 <p>Ye Clan’s courtyard decoration could be compared to Zuoshi Clan’s. Zuoshi Clan was the weakest secluded Clan. Ye Clan on the other hand, seemed to also be at the same level considering that the elderly men behind Ye Guyan had all achieved the lowest class of Peak Martial Saint Stage.</p>
 <p>The weakest supreme aristocratic Clan!</p>
 <p>Most importantly, the person-in-charge was a youth. He knew that the future of Ye Clan was really bright. Hence, very few people would try to have conflicts with Ye Clan.</p>
 <p>They all knew the moral of not discriminating against a poor youth.</p>
 <p>What's different about Ye Clan compared to Zuoshi Clan was that the buildings here were more towards looking delicately beautiful. All of the buildings and decorations here had a really strong elegant feeling to them. It was as if it was made by a woman’s hands.</p>
 <p>They walked past a jade colored bridge. There was a clear man-made lake under the bridge and its trickling water flowing noises made Qing Shui realize that it was actually living water.</p>
 <p>There were fish, prawns, turtles and crabs in the lake. There was also a Puppet Tree by the lake. It was cut really meticulously and from time to time, bird chirping noises would be heard, adding in more living atmosphere to this place.</p>
 <p>They arrived at the main hall. Very quickly, people came to serve them tea. It's just a really faint tea smell and Qing Shui could already tell that this tea was extraordinary. Even though it couldn't be compared to Qing Shui’s Red Robe in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was definitely still counted as an outstanding tea. In reality, there are very few teas that are better than this tea he was drinking.</p>
 <p>“Sister, I haven't introduced them to you, this is Uncle Qing Shui, grandpa Cang, Uncle Fei and Grandpa Bai.” Ye Yan smiled.</p>
 <p>“Clan Head Ye, you can just call me Qing Shui.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Then stop calling me Clan Head Ye, you can just call me Ye Guyan!” Ye Guyan smiled when she heard what Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>“Seniors, Qing Shui, please have some tea.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Oh, you guys are from Green Cloud Continent. That place is quite far away from here, it's Yan`Er’s pleasure to meet gramps and a few of my life saviours.”</p>
 <p>The group once again greeted each other politely. After all, they didn't really know each other well. The conversation began with Ye Yan talking about her own stuff.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, is there something you and gramps need to do? That's why you came to Southern Viewing Continent from so far away.” Ye Guyan raised her head and asked after pondering for a while.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated and felt that it was best if he didn't mention about these things. Hence, at the time when he wanted to look for an excuse, Ye Guyan smiled and said: “I don't mean anything , I just want to see if I'll be of help. I'm keen on helping you guys, but it seems like this is a matter that's not really convenient to talk about.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, actually it's our first time here, so we aren't really familiar with this place. In the future, we are going to need a lot of help.” Qing Shui said hurriedly.</p>
 <p>“Don't worry about it, just tell me whenever you need help. As long as it's something I can do, I would never step back. Saving Yan`er was the biggest favor you did for me.” Ye Guyan said seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded. He could feel their sincerity. People with formidable strength took promises the most seriously. If they couldn't do it, they would use some other methods to repay them.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, it's already evening. Food and alcohol have been served. There were only Ye Guyan and Ye Yan in Ye Clan. Including Qing Shui and the group, there were only six people here.</p>
 <p>“Miss Ye, what kind of powerful forces are in Southern Sea City? Would you mind telling me about it? I need to get myself prepared as well. If not, I wouldn't even know how I die.” Qing Shui smiled and said to Ye Guyan.</p>
 <p>“Of course, Tantai Aristocrat Clan is counted as one, Wuma Aristocrartic Clan, Putuo Mountain, Sea King Palace, Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan, Southern Sky Poison Sect, Violet Bamboo Forest”</p>
 <p>When Ye Guyan talked about Eastern Palace Aristocratic Clan, it completely stunned Qing Shui. He didn't manage to hear the last few parts clearly, but he did hear the words Putuo Mountain.</p>
 <p>Southern Sea? Putuo Mountain?</p>
 <p>This was too much of a coincidence. Even Qing Shui was a bit shocked now. But actually, he was more stunned when he first heard about Eastern Palace Aristocratic Clan.</p>
 <p>“Miss Ye, is Tantai Aristocrat Clan really strong? I happened to hear by chance people saying that someone called Tantai Xianzi got a World Cleansing Demonic Lotus.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Tantai Aristocrat Clan is really strong. It's an aristocratic clan that has passed on for a long time. It's considered a supreme aristocratic clan in the Southern Viewing Continent. It's always said that Tantai Aristocrat Clan has supreme warriors, but it shouldn't be just rumors, Tantai Xianzi is the strongest warrior among those of her generations. Even if she was to be compared to all the nine continents, very few could actually be compared to her. She is a girl who’s known by others as being fairies.” Ye Guyan smiled.</p>
 <p>“How is she compared to Miss Ye?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan stunned and smiled: “compared to her, I have to admit that I'm not as good.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew about the habit of warriors, there would be a limit to which they stayed humble, let alone this was a beautiful woman in front of him. Logically, for someone as beautiful as her, she wouldn't admit that she wasn't as good as any women. But now, even a girl like her who came down from Heavens felt that she wasn't as good as her, Qing Shui could imagine just how outstanding the girl was.</p>
 <p>“Miss Ye, I have a feeling that you’re already beyond an ordinary person, so if it goes like this, that person shouldn't be half bad as well?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, don't praise me so much, I'm someone who has quite a good endurance to things like this.” Ye Guyan smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Old Master, please have some tea!”</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan invited Cang Wuya and the others to drink some tea.</p>
 <p>“Is Putuo Mountain powerful?” Qing Shui smiled and asked. He didn't actually ask directly about Donggong Clan. One must be vigilant so as not to be harmed.</p>
 <p>“Putuo Mountain is a sect located deep in an island that's in Southern Sea. They’re all women of extreme beauties and formidable strength. There were traces of them across the World of the Nine Continents even though it's very few. Legend has it that Tantai Xianzi is someone from Putuo Mountain. However, it's just a rumor, she would be the only one who knew if that’s right.” Ye Guysn smiled and looked at Qing Shui. Her beautiful pupils looked as calm as water.</p>
 <p>“Sea King’s Palace is such a weird name. It gave people a feeling that it's underwater.” Qing Shui acted like he was asking casually.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, they’re under water. Their base is just below the Southern Sea. It’s an underwater palace. However, it’s really close to the island itself and really far away from Putuo Mountain. They’re really mysterious, hence, i don’t really know as much about them.</p>
 <p>“Wuma is a very special surname.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, do you want to know more about the things that I mentioned just now? I'll go through it briefly with you then. There are some things which even I'm unclear about because some of the information was very hard to get.” Ye Guyan wanted to laugh when she looked at Qing Shui trying to make up excuses to ask questions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled awkwardly: “Well then, sorry Miss Ye for the trouble.”</p>
