 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the top-notch Flying Swords being refined for 64 days, Qing Shui was already satisfied. However, now he was contemplating whether it would be possible for him to proceed to the next level of refinement. He knew that it was going to be extremely difficult to do so. At the moment, he already found himself on a tough spot. It might be crazy for him to consider lasting for another 17 days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite that, Qing Shui was willing to take this bet. He indeed knew that his body might not be able to take it. After all, throughout the entire process, he hadn’t rested at all and had been constantly unleashing his own Blood Essence and Nine Yang True Flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A drop of Blood Essence was required each day. Being frank about it, not everyone can withstand this form of exhaustion. If ordinary men were to lose a drop of Blood Essence, they would have needed to lay down on their bed for at least half a year to recover. After all, there were only three drops of Blood Essence in an ordinary human’s body. Martial warriors might have more Blood Essence, but still, they wouldn't be able to stand this kind of consumption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If someone realized what Qing Shui was doing at the moment, that person would definitely be shocked deeply. By now, Qing Shui’s face was as pale as white paper. If it was only about losing a drop of Blood Essence per day, Qing Shui would have still, barely been able to hold on. And he wouldn’t have looked this miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would have been alright, as he had his own ways to help his body recover. But now, not only was he unable to do so, but he also had to release the Origin Qi in his body continuously. Even a person made of steel wouldn’t be able to hold on against this kind of torture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">70 days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very determined to hold on! His lips had already gotten so dry that it cracked a few times. His face looked as pale as paper, even gradually becoming thinner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">75 days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, dried traces of blood could be seen across Qing Shui’s lips. It was unpleasant to see the cracked lips on his face. His cheek had gotten so shriveled that they began to collapse inwards. His muscles were all dried up, and at this point, he was very skinny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">80 days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that he was at his limit. His entire being was on the verge of collapse, even his mind had started getting a bit blurry. The tip of his tongue was already full of bite marks, and he was hanging on solely from the excruciating pain which he was feeling from time to time. Throughout the entire process, Qing Shui hadn’t taken even one medicinal pill yet. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a miserable state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud and clear roaring noise could be heard in Qing Shui’s ears. It was as though there were countless ferocious beasts in the sky. At the moment, his entire figure was as thin as paper. Even the people close to Qing Shui wouldn’t be able to recognize him at his current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today was the last day. He must push through it, or else, everything which he had worked so hard for would have been for naught. Qing Shui was constantly motivating himself as time went on little by little. At this point, Qing Shui felt that every second which passed was like an entire year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s body shook abruptly, and at this moment, the Force of Rebirth started giving out weak life forces, supplying a bit of juice for him to barely hold on. He was feeling incredibly feeble, as if his entire body had been sucked out dry. He was arguably similar to a mountain-hiker who had no more energy to climb up the mountain, but yet still had to hold on and mustn’t stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui clenched his teeth as he tried to hang on. He was reluctant to give up at a time like this so he sucked it up and tried his best to maintain his Nine Yang True Fire. At that moment, all he was thinking of was his family, his women, and also his children. Initially, he never planned to hold on for this long, but now that he had made it this far, he had no choice but to keep going.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, Qing Shui felt as if he had drowned himself in the sea of his memories. The Origin Force in his body was still leaking out of his body as usual, but by now, it felt as if they had run dry in his body. This was a taboo among the warriors, continuing on from this point would damage one’s lifespan heavily and potentially leave behind serious Hidden Illnesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, this wasn’t what Qing Shui was considering about. He was a formidable physician capable of curing Hidden Illnesses, also he didn’t need to worry about his own lifespan. Only Qing Shui would dare to exhaust his life force recklessly like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the long-awaited noise came through, the Flying Sword flew out of the Demon Refining Furnace and appeared in front of Qing Shui. At this moment, Qing Shui who had let down his guard immediately spurted out a mouthful of blood on the Flying Sword. Without further delay, he quickly took out a medicinal pill and ate it. If he was to faint like that, there was a high chance he might not be able to wake up ever again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui collapsed. He seemed like he was sound asleep as his entire body was deadly still. However, a satisfied smile could be hanging on his face. A good thing that his body was slowly recovering on its own. With him no longer having to consume both of his Blood Essence as well as Origin Qi, his body revitalized itself gradually. The medicinal pill which he took in had melted, slowly nurturing his body and replenishing his strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui woke up once again, three days had passed. The first thing he did was to look for the Flying Sword. When his attempt to find it failed, he immediately looked into his body and became aware of a silver Big Dipper Sword in his Dantian. It just so happened to be floating right on top of the Paragon Vessel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tiny Paragon Vessel was sitting inside the Dantian cross-legged. Suddenly, a small Big Dipper Sword appeared above its head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With just one thought, the sword appeared right in front of Qing Shui and slowly enlarged itself. It was like the spring water as it contained a warm and gentle aura. However, the sword was shining brightly, and Qing Shui was able to sense the sharpness of the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After resting for three days, Qing Shui was almost fully healed up. But the organs across his body would still take time to recover completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui tried making the Flying Sword bigger. For the time being, its maximum size could reach about 3 meters in height and one foot in width. The moment Qing Shui thought about it and tried to give instructions to it through his mind, it appeared right in front of him at a fearsome speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He analyzed it with his Heavenly Vision Technique</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Dipper Sword (Flying Sword) Divine Artifact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was all that was shown. Qing Shui could feel this sword like it was a part of his limbs. After all, this Flying Sword had cheated him so many drops of his Blood Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flying Sword was finally made! Qing Shui let out a huge sigh of relief. His effort to put his life at stake had turned out for the better. With the Flying Swords, Qing Shui could effortlessly slaughter tens of Golden Yakshas by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This could be considered one of his killer weapons now. With the Flying Sword just freshly made, it would take time to nourish it. In the future, Qing Shui would also need to collect some unique materials to raise the strength of the Flying Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui who was starving decided to make something to eat. After enjoying his meal, he began cultivating his Ancient Strengthening Technique which had achieved the Ninth Heavenly Layer. Despite reaching the peak of the technique, Qing Shui still believed that martial arts had no limits. He felt that there should be a realm even higher than the Ninth Heavenly Layer. It was just that until now, no one had yet to be able to break through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time he should go out, his body was almost fully recovered. And ever since he got the Flying Sword, he felt that his back had straightened even more. By now, even if some brainless people were to seek trouble with him, he wouldn’t fear them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The successful outcome which Qing Shui received from refining the Flying Swords had caused some changes in his initial plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, Qing Shui had wanted to stay behind in Northern Blue City for a few more days. But now, he didn’t know if he should still stick to that. He didn’t know if he should make his ways towards the inner part of Nine Continents World right away or he should go for the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain which was in that same area instead.</span></p>

Thus, this part of the Nine Continents World was just as fearsome. But it was a fact that the Northern Blue Domain would still be the most powerful and developed area in the whole Nine Continents World</span></p>

Also, Grand Demons were very common there. Even a normal pedestrian across the street might turn out to be a Grand Demon. A Grand Demon was a fearsome existence that didn’t belong to the human tribes. It might be a certain formidable demonic beast with high cultivations, or it could also be the Demon Gods. That was an exciting world, it was a place that would make the people from other places felt unreal.</span></p>

Of course, the demons could also join certain great forces and the same vice versa. They would go by different means to ultimately achieve the same goal in the end.</span></p>

People constantly fought for resources and also for Heavenly And Earthly Treasures. Almost every day, fights could be seen breaking out across the area. Countless humans and demons would lose their life as a result. But to the entire World of Nine Continents, this infinitesimal death was nothing.</span></p>
