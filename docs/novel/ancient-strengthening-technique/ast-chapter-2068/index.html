 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet another three days passed. Qing Shui and Shen Huang once again advanced further. By now, they were already deep within the Flower Ocean. Along the way, they had killed a few powerful beasts and had even encountered a small swarm of human-killing bees. Even though it was described as a small swarm, there were still about 200 of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had immediately gone past them with his Nine Continents Boots. He was reminded of the killer bees covering up the entire sky and their venom,raining down like storms. If he were to come in contact with it, the consequences would definitely be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The deeper they traveled into the flower ocean, the higher the temperature got. Meanwhile, the flowers also looked brighter and brighter as they progressed through the ocean. The flowers at this point were already as bright as fire. Under normal circumstances, Shen Huang should only have a week left to live. Qing Shui was really anxious. Even he wasn’t sure if they would run into the Blaze Moth. The chances of encountering one were too small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knitted his brows. Even at times when he was facing off against formidable opponents, at least the goal was made clear in front of him. But now, he was feeling a bit helpless. He was reluctant to see the woman disappearing in front of him. Even the last resort, his own Nine Yang Golden Body, might not necessarily be able to save her. He felt that it should be able to carry out the job, but he couldn’t guarantee it. If by that time, he still failed to save her, he would only end up even more depressed than he already was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang’s body was already in a very weak state. In fact, this had already been the case since the time when they had celebrated New Year. By now, she was no longer able to unleash even 40% of her strength. Seeing Qing Shui knitting his brows, she had finally released herself. It was as though she were accepting reality and treating now as enjoying the final stage of her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a beautiful tree!” Shen Huang pointed at a tree far away and said to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned upon seeing it. Wasn’t that the legendary Wishing Tree?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wishing Tree was an unusual tree, fiery-red in color. However, it didn’t look as lively as it should. The tree wasn’t really that tall, yet it possessed a formidable vitality. It tended to grow out with a kind of heart-shaped fruit. The fruit, which grew from it, would come to be known as the Wishing Fruit. The reason why the Wishing Tree got its name was precisely thanks to the Wishing Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to legend, the Wishing Tree contained a kind of mysterious energy. When a person ate the fruit and made a wish, it would come true immediately. However, from Qing Shui’s perspective, this sounded a bit absurd. However, this was still his first time encountering a Wishing Tree. Furthermore, there were about 10 ripened Wishing Fruits grown on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were red fruits shaped like a heart. They were giving out abundant fragrance which could cause people to drool just by looking at them. Qing Shui immediately probed it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Peach Tree!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. At that moment, he felt a strong urge to cuss. It was not a Wishing Tree! It’s just a plain, peach tree. But moving on, Qing Shui once again revealed a surprised look. It was due to the word “Immortal” which was added to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quickly observed the fruits on the Immortal Peach Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Peach!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mysterious Immortal Peach Tree had existed for 30.000 years. It was stored with abundant Spiritual Qi and could help stabilize one’s foundation and raise strength, innate talents as well as potential by 10%. Other than that, it also cleansed one’s meridians and bones of their poisons. Each year, the fruit could only be eaten once, and a person could only take up to a maximum of five fruits throughout a lifetime. After consuming the fifth one, the fruit would only be left with the function of curing poisons or could only be treated as a delicacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had an Immortal Peach Tree back in the realm, but it was totally different from this one. The Immortal Peach Tree in the realm only had the function of increasing one’s lifespan. Each person was only allowed to take in one which could increase a lifespan by 50 years. That was about it, but despite that, its value was still worth multiple cities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui’s attention was only on the function to cure poisons. He totally neglected the other ones as he looked at Shen Huang in joy, “We might have found an antidote for your poison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you talking about the Wishing Tree?” Shen Huang was aware that this was a Wishing Tree. This was how all the Wishing Trees looked across the continents. However, no one had yet to test anything from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s it. Here, let’s make a wish under the tree. For all you know, it may really come true.” Qing Shui was smiling widely at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang might be a woman, but she was totally unconvinced by this kind of things. Nevertheless, she still smiled and nodded. She then moved her sight onto the Wishing Tree and shut her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, what wish did you make?” Shen Huang asked at the moment when the both of them finished making their wishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a secret. It may lose its effect if I say it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, he had forgotten that Shen Huang could sense it. Even though what he was thinking wasn’t dangerous to Shen Huang, it was still closely related to her, which was why she was able to sense it. Deep down, she felt very inconsolable, but at the same time, she was also very happy and had a feeling which words couldn’t describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘In the vast sea of humanity, we must have been guided by destiny, for us to be able to meet. She is a beautiful and gifted woman, but maybe because God has started becoming envious of her beauty; it decided to take away her life at such a young age. I like her, no, I love her. I don’t know why, maybe it’s because she is beautiful… Actually, a beautiful look can be used as an excuse to explain why one likes a certain person. But this isn’t me being cheap, I really hope that she can recover from her poison and stay happy for the rest of her life. I know that there are things which she still needs to do, and thus, I hope that I can share half of my life with her.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was saying all of that in his heart. At this moment, he wasn’t trying to act biased, but instead, he really meant what he said. Even after sharing half of his lifespan with her, he would still have many years left to live. Thus, if he could really do that, he would be more than willing to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was sincerely making his wish in his heart, but he forgot that Shen Huang was able to feel it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was able to sense the sincerity which came from deep within the man’s heart. She never expected that the man would be willing to share half of his life with her. The most precious thing to a warrior was his lifespan. No matter how close they had been, even in the case of husbands and wives, it would be impossible for them to be willing to share half of their lifespans with each other. After all, humans were selfish beings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was feeling very emotional. At this moment, she had neglected everything around her and had her eyes only on Qing Shui. She forgot about the fact that he had wives, children, and all his other weak points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui had known that Shen Huang would know what he was thinking, how would he have felt? Maybe he would have chosen to make a simpler wish instead, for example, hoping that she could become healthy again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, because Qing Shui had his clan members and wives, it would be normal if he made other wishes, for example, letting his clan prosper and become stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go and eat the peaches. These things should taste really delicious. For all you know, you may recover from your poison right after you eat them.” Qing Shui held Shen Huang’s hand as they approached the Immortal Peach Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang followed him. The smile on her face looked very casual and relaxed. It was a smile which came from deep within her heart, an honest smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at the moment when they were getting near the tree, Qing Shui’s expression changed. He clenched his teeth and immediately leaped toward Shen Huang. Despite that, Shen Huang who was in his arms still trembled. As that happened, Qing Shui knew that things had just turned for the worse. At that instant, Qing Shui noticed a Rainbow Snake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rainbow color across its body looked very bright. This was a deadly snake. Even though it might have the thickness of only a little finger and was about four feet long, it possessed a fast speed. This kind of poisonous snake was fatal to one’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which part of you was bitten?” Qing Shui asked anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quickly poked on a few of her Acupoints to significantly slow down the speed at which her blood was circulating around her body. Suddenly, Qing Shui saw the Rainbow Snake still on top of Shen Huang. Furthermore, the part which it bit on just happened to be on her well-rounded buttocks. Qing Shui was stunned. He quickly extended his hand and secretly unleashed his Dragon-capturing Hands to capture and strangle its weakest spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, he intended to strangle it to death. But as he thought more carefully about it, he immediately took out the Demon Refining Furnace and pinned it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Shen Huang was already starting to lose her consciousness. What a poisonous snake! Even the current Qing Shui had yet to come across a poison like this. As he looked at Shen Huang’s expression, he knew that he couldn’t delay it any longer and quickly carried her up and put her on a couch which he just took out from the realm.</span></p>
