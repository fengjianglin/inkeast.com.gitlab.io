 <p><strong>AST 1326 - Fighting against 70,000 sun worth of strength, First Level of the Nine Palace Laws</strong></p>
 <p>Somehow, Pang Shitu’s words still surprised Qing Shui. He didn’t know what this old man was plotting. The reason being, not only would the old man not benefit from anything if he won the bet, if Pang Clan lost, they would all lose face.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui saw a trace of cold light deep within the huge eyes of the old man. That was killing intent!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui came to understand something. Naturally, if they lost, Qing Shui would call the shots and if they won, they would rather not gain anything from it. There was also one thing which wasn’t mentioned openly and that was that they could kill Qing Shui, making things look like an accident and thereby absolving them from their promises..</p>
 <p>The old man was someone who was very firm with his decision to kill his opponents. If he managed to kill them, he would help save his clan from future troubles. If he didn’t manage to do so, he would leave himself some methods to survive. So far, he had managed to do that.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. After that, he spoke slowly, “Rest assured, if I lose, I will guarantee you a life. I don’t care who it is, even if it is someone who is at the brink of death, so long as he or she is someone you point out, I will help extend their life by at least a hundred years.</p>
 <p>One should never give in despite how powerful your opponent might be. Besides, Qing Shui wasn’t confident that he would be able to beat his opponent. Hence, it would be best if he could leave a suspense in his opponent’s mind and let them hesitate for a while before laying their murderous hands on him.</p>
 <p>Pang Shitu’s eyes twitched. He somehow still knew quite a lot about Qing Shui. Hence, whether he believed him or not, at least now his heart has moved a little. Qing Shui could feel that the opponent’s killing intent had just diminished a little.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had achieved his goal. He smiled and said once again, “Let’s begin! Swords do not have eyes, it’s best to be careful!”</p>
 <p>“It’s destiny whether we die or remain alive today!” Pang Shitu took out an enormous lion headed sword while speaking.</p>
 <p>This was a three meter long, 30cm wide, enormous fiery red colored lion headed sword. On the tip of a sword was a lion’s head which looked very realistic. The lion’s head somehow resembled something like a flame. It was giving off a fierce and malevolent aura.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. But he wasn’t holding any weapons. The reason being that he didn’t need to hold any.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Pang Shitu also used his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. His was a set of fiery red colored armor. It seemed like it came as a set with the Lion Headed Sword. At the moment when he saw Qing Shui not holding any weapons, he proceeded to say, “Make your move, I won’t hold back.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head. After that, he summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui had the initiative to attack, he immediately summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and used its weakening techniques. And at the moment when his opponent was still in shock, he immediately went on to use his Emperor’s Qi.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>At the same time when Qing Shui managed to weaken the old man, he was also quite stunned with his strength. Twenty thousand sun worth of the old man’s strength immediately got reduced by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The old man actually had strength which was worth almost 70,000 sun.</p>
 <p>Merely Pang Clan already had this kind of strength. Imagine Yehuang Clan and Puyang Clan. Was Pang Shitu considered the strongest within Pang Clan? How was the strength within Dancing Phoenix Continent distributed?</p>
 <p>In just a blink of an eye, he already lost twenty thousand sun worth of strength. Even for someone like Pang Shitu, his countenance also drastically changed. He swung the enormous Lion Headed Sword in his hand. As he did so, a ray of red light flashed across the sword. Following which, an enormous flame lion appeared and rushed its way towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He still had roughly 50,000 sun worth of strength left. And there was also quite a huge gap between Qing Shui’s strength and his. Nevertheless, Qing Shui found it to be somewhat manageable once he weakened him. The reason being that Qing Shui was someone who had stepped through the great door to Heavenly Dao. Pang Shitu on the other hand, he might be strong but he was still someone who only had one of his feet on the threshold of the great door of Heavenly Dao.</p>
 <p>Also, there was an 80% chance that the slash which the old man just performed was a Spirit Energy Attack. Hence, Qing Shui wasn’t worried. It was also unlucky for Pang Shitu that his martial technique was based on flame elements.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui activated his consciousness, the Nine Continents Mountain immediately blocked the enormous Lion Dragon.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain got cut in half. Right at this moment, Qing Shui swung his head and a silver platform appeared above Pang Shitu.</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>Second Wave Seal of Xuantian! Reduce the opponent’s speed and reaction time by 20%.</p>
 <p>During this time, Qing Shui’s Seal of Xuantian had already broken through up to the Second Wave.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain and initiated an attack on Pang Shitu with it.</p>
 <p>Now, Pang Shitu also more or less knew a few of the strange things about Qing Shui. Originally, he thought that he would be able to crush the enormous stone with only one slash with his sword alone. But now, he already knew that this thing was a precious thing. He reversed his enormous Lion Headed Sword and once again cut towards the Nine Continents Mountain with the back of the sword. This time, he used even more force than before.</p>
 <p>At the moment when he pushed it away, the old man moved. He immediately charged towards Qing Shui. His Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was equipped almost all the way to his teeth. The Lion Headed Sword was spurting out flames which somewhat resembled that of blood.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui waved his hand, an enormous Primordial Flame Dragon Whip whipped towards Pang Shitu.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>The Formation Eye Stone helped boost the strength of a formation onefold. This also included the Nine Palace Steps. In an instant, Qing Shui appeared behind Pang Shitu. He was very nimbly whipping the Primordial Flame Dragon Whip at Pang Shitu.</p>
 <p>Stepping into the great door of Heavenly Dao combined with the mysterious features of the Nine Palace Steps, Qing Shui was able to quite flexibly deal with opponents who were a few times stronger than himself.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was at a spot not far away from them. The moment Qing Shui moved, it also initiated its attacks.</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>This also helped reduce 20% of speed…...</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant contained a bloodline which wasn’t inferior to that of the dragon species. And now, it has strength which surpassed ten thousand sun. Under the effect of Heaven Shaking Drums, it was still growing at a frightening speed during this time.</p>
 <p>This was precisely the stage where the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant would soar up in strength. It was just like when humans went through puberty. Given time, provided that they consumed the right nutrients, their body would grow rapidly. It was an all-around upgrade.</p>
 <p>Legend has it that the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was a being which could one day surpass an enormous dragon when it grew. Given that the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was strong enough, Qing Shui’s strength would increase. Water tended to spill when it was full. By then, it was likely that Qing Shui would break through to the False God Realm.</p>
 <p>With this happening, Pang Shitu’s speed was significantly slower than that of Qing Shui’s. Without speed, basically, it would mean his chances of winning would be low unless his strength was more than ten times or even a hundred times greater than that of his opponents. If so, he would be able to perform acts similar to ‘dominating ten professional martial artists with brute force alone’, to the state of causing everything to be powerless in front of his absolute strength alone.</p>
 <p>As of now, Pang Shitu was in a passive position. Despite this, he was still able to defend against Qing Shui’s attacks. Even though he might get hit occasionally from time to time. Unfortunately, Qing Shui’s attacks were unable to cause any damage to him. This made him let out a huge laugh.</p>
 <p>“I will stand here and let you hit me as you wish. You still won’t be able to beat me.” Eventually, Pang Shitu decided that he would just stop moving. That powerful Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation of his had made him like a divine turtle.</p>
 <p>“Do you really not plan to move at all?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“I won’t move!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately summoned the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>Pang Shitu wasn’t in the least concerned about the Thunderous Beast’s weak attacks. It was just that very quickly, he managed to notice something was wrong. His face changed and he immediately swung his sword.</p>
 <p>The red color on the lion’s head on top of the Lion Headed Sword was turning darker and darker and looking more and more frightening. That lion’s head suddenly shone with a strong bloody light and enveloped the old man.</p>
 <p>Bloody Devilish Lion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could clearly feel that other than the Emperor’s Qi, the rest of his weakening effects had all disappeared. Furthermore, his strength had even increased. In a flash, he was already charging towards the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast quickly tried to avoid it. But it seemed like it was already a bit late by the time it did so.</p>
 <p>Deep down, Qing Shui was also greatly astonished with what happened.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Step, Great Reversal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui instantly swapped positions with Pang Shitu. Pang Shitu, who still had no idea what just happened, still sped forward in the opposite direction for a distance. His body glowed with red light and when he discovered what happened, he was thoroughly enraged.</p>
 <p>“I will see how many times you can block my attacks!</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant ferociously stomped on Pang Shitu.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, it didn’t work.</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>No effect!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t hesitate to retrieve both the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Thunderous Beast. He used the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring to avoid the terrifying attacks from Pang Shitu.</p>
 <p>Pang Shitu was currently in a strengthened state. It was only for a temporary period of time. Other than the Emperor’s Qi, other supportive techniques were all now useless. Hence, Qing Shui wanted to wait and only fight back once his Bloody Devilish Lion state depleted.</p>
 <p>Bloody Devilish Lion, lock!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a bloody red colored ray of light on top of Pang Shitu’s sword began enveloping Qing Shui’s body like a spider net. After that, Pang Shitu disappeared while leaving an afterimage behind. What followed was that an earth-shattering aura began to push down against Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui cursed silently, he felt cold sweat all over his body. With a pull of his hand, he retreated with explosive speed as a gigantic water screen manifested.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The only thing Qing Shui felt was as if a huge mountain collided against himself. Mouthfuls of blood kept spurting out of his mouth. Luckily, he was able to withstand the impact from the hit.</p>
 <p>To think that the Nature Energy didn’t cancel out that red light…..</p>
 <p>Area Dominance.</p>
 <p>Luckily, the Area Dominance managed to help dispersed it. But right at this moment, Pang Shitu once again made his way towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Puyang Honghu was paying close attention to the battle taking place on the stage. Both of his fists were about to make their move. But right at this moment, a voice came through to his ears, “I know you mean well but for now, your help is not yet necessary. If I am really in a pinch, I will tell you about it, thank you!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had long since noticed this person. To think that he was here to save himself. Without much thought, he was already able to figure out who it was. It had to be from those few clans. He felt that the likeliness of them being from Puyang Clan was really high. But at the same time, he wasn’t really certain about it.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Step, Emptiness!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body slowly became more and more vague. After that, he appeared far away in the distance.</p>
 <p>Meteor Rush!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shot out two Ten Thousand Year Icesteel Beads towards Pang Shitu.</p>
 <p>Ding-ding!</p>
 <p>Under the state of Bloody Devilish Lion, he was just like a divine turtle which never exposed its head, leaving other people not knowing what to do with it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was better off dodging constantly. Within the Nine Palace, he was king.</p>
 <p>The Nine Palace King!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to have thought of something. After that, he multitasked. While constantly dodging, he was thinking of the controls he had within the Nine Palace. Ever since he cultivated up to the Nine Palace Steps, he thought that there wasn’t any more room for improvement.</p>
 <p>He mixed all of his movement techniques together and used them with his Nine Palace Steps. Slowly, he seemed to understand them more and more clearly. That was a very bizarre feeling. It felt as if everything within the nine palace had become alive.</p>
 <p>Multiply Gravity!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui saw the color of the spot where his consciousness was focusing on had gotten darker. For a moment, he was stunned, he never expected this kind of thing to actually work. This was the Nine Palace Laws.</p>
 <p>It was just like the Heaven and Earth Laws. He had the right to decide everything within the Nine Palace. The Laws were all set up by himself.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Qing Shui noticed that the current Nine Palace Steps had reached the first level in Nine Palace Laws</p>
 <p>First Heavenly Level, unleash Nine Palace Laws, capable of putting his opponents under the effect of ten times gravity.</p>
 <p>Ten times gravity. If he had been in his previous incarnation, he would have been able to immediately murder his opponents. But right now, his opponent was a powerful warrior. This might have affected his opponent but the influence caused wasn’t that significant. In any case, it was still better than nothing. Let alone that he could still continue improving it once its grade was higher.</p>
 <p>Devour, consuming the essence of opponents. The first level can slowly devour, causing the exhaustion rate of the target to increase by 10%.</p>
 <p>Heavy Strike, the master of the Nine Palace can stack his attacks together, increasing by 10% in power. There’s a high chance that the target would be blasted backwards and a small chance to cause the target to sink into panic, lowering their strength and dispersing their concentration.</p>
 <p>This was the Nine Palace Laws at First Heavenly Level. Qing Shui was somewhat still satisfied with it. He could use it simply by willing it.</p>
 <p>Ten times gravity! Devour!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately unleashed the Nine Palace Laws at its first heavenly grade against Pang Shitu.</p>
 <p>And at this moment, the red light around Pang Shitu’s body also disappeared. Qing Shui looked really pale but the injury across his body had recovered by a lot. Added on he had powerful bones himself, there was no longer any major problems in front of him. He knew that his chance had finally come.</p>
