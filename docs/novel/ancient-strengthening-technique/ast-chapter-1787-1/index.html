You're reached a bottleneck now, but as long as you can break through it, you'll enjoy a long period of rapid and smooth-sailing progressing thereafter." Qing Shui pat him on the shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui came back the last time, he had helped them. The strongest Qing Zun and a few others were only at Early Martial Saint. However, they were now at Peak Martial Saint and would soon attain a breakthrough to the Martial Emperor level.</span></p>

She was a quiet girl of few words and her aptitude weren't bad. However, she wasn't considered any kind of rare talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn't like to fight and gave off a quiet feeling, as if she wasn't that interested in anything at all. This was the daughter which Qing Shui worried the most for. It was because seeing her would make one feel a little heavy-hearted, as if feeling that she wasn't happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father!" Qing Yan smiled and called out to Qing Shui. She was smiling and it was a smile that came right from her heart. She was truly happy to be able to see Qing Shui. However, there still seemed to be a hint of worry on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Our lass has also grown up now. Tell Father, do you have anyone you like?" Qing Shui wasn't just asking casually. He wanted to see how this daughter of his would react.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised to see how obvious his daughter's reaction was. She was grown up and her reaction caused Qing Shui to be stumped. He had no idea if she was blushing because she felt shy or if he had hit the bullseye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, alright, if you say there's none, then there's none. But if there's really someone, you must definitely tell me, alright? I'll help to give you some advice. Your Father likes whoever you choose. Alright?" Qing Shui knew that no matter what the truth was, he mustn't asked any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, thank you Father."</span></p>

Qing Shui took out a few brushes, a zither, as well as some exquisite drawing paper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had specially prepared these items. When he knew that he was coming back, he had prepared some gifts for them in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father, I want them too. You can't be biased." Qing Yu reached out her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? Is our Yu`er able to draw as well?" Qing Shui brought out some more as he spoke. Of course he had prepared some for Qing Yin and the others as well. However, if they didn't like drawing, then he won't have anything else for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also Qing Yun, Yun Duan's and Qing Shui's daughter. She had quite little interaction with Qing Shui and he had given her very little impression of him. It was still the same now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yun had grown up as well. Regardless what personalities these children have, they all held their father in great admiration. Their mothers had told them a lot about their father. He was a legend, a powerful existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Later on, Father will teach you a set of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cloud Steps&nbsp;that's suitable for you. What do you think?" When Qing Shui sensed the aura coming from his daughter, he suddenly thought of this.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The&nbsp;Cloud Steps&nbsp;had evolved from the Nine Palace Steps and was something which Qing Shui hadn't been using. It could also be called the Nine Palace Steps, one that was for females. Therefore, Qing Shui planned to teach this to the children.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because in comparison, the&nbsp;Cloud Steps&nbsp;was a slightly simple but it still held a great essence. If one reached a high level of proficiency in the&nbsp;Cloud Steps</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;in the future, they could change it into the the complicated Nine Palace Steps that had an even greater effect that the current Nine Palace Steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright!"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I did, a lot!" Qing Jun spoke using ventriloquism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Jun was the daughter who Yehuang Guwu had adopted. She was born to be unable to speak but Qing Shui now had the ability to cure her. Qing Shui's five element forces and cultivation were very powerful. He could also use his Force of Rebirth and Life and Death Needles to heal her now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This time around, Father will be able to treat you and let you speak with your mouth." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm already used to it. It's fine like this." Qing Jun gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I want to hear you use your voice to call me Father." Qing Shui rubbed her head. When he squat down, he would need to raise his head to be able to speak to Qing Jun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Teng, Qing Nuo, Qing Long...</span></p>

His figure was more slender, appeared less headstrong, and his pair of bright eyes made him appear quite handsome. He was over ten years old and had changed a lot. With Zhu Qing's and his own genes, how ugly could their child be? It was just that when he was younger, he didn't appear as exquisite looking as the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan and Yuchang weren't at home. Yehuang Guwu had previously said that they were at the Lotus Sect.</span></p>

His women had split up into different groups, not so that they could pit against each other, but that they were each doing their own things. In Qing Shui's previous life, this would be considered their career.</span></p>

It had now developed quite well and was considered one of the biggest trade association in the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Ruyan, Tantai Xuan were at the Putuo Mountain, but they would come to the Qing Clan a few times each year.</span></p>
