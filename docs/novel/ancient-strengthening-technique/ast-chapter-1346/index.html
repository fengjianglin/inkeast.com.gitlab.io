 <p><strong>AST 1346 - News of Yan Zhongyue? Puyang Clan's False God Cultivator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Sensing the powerful force surging in his body, Qing Shui had never felt so replenished before. He started to slowly perform Taichi Fist in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>He didn't know what realm he had reached for his Taichi Fist but each fist and palm he launched out would contain traces of Heavenly Dao. This was an ability he had gained after reaching Heavenly Dao.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>This was a realm, a mysterious power. In the future, those who couldn't attain the Heavenly Dao would all become dropouts. Only those who had the force of Heavenly Dao would be able to attain the False God realm.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Old Man Puyang had already attained the Heavenly Dao but was just at the very elementary phase. In comparison, the lady's force of Heavenly Dao was much stronger and Qing Shui could clearly sense it.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>What Qing Shui didn't know was that the lady was also a little astonished when she saw Qing Shui. However, she was not showing much of it in her expression. It was because she could see that Qing Shui had also attained the Heavenly Dao. Generally, the younger one was when attaining the Heavenly Dao, the greater the person's future achievements would be. With Qing Shui's age, it would be no problem for him to become a False God. This was why the lady felt astonished.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Even amongst a big group of people, there might not be a single False God cultivator. Therefore, when the lady saw Qing Shui's changes, she also felt very complicated. It was impossible for her to forget Qing Shui. She could never forget her first man, just like how men would never forget about their first woman. One would never be able to forget.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Each time she saw Qing Shui, she could see that he had made tremendous improvements. She didn't know if it was for her, but she could feel Qing Shui's sincerity.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>It was a pity that Qing Shui wasn't clear on all this nor did he dare to even think about it. Qing Shui didn't dare to have too much hope toward this lady. He hoped that she wouldn't hate him and that she would be able to live a good life and be happier.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui waved his two hands and the currents in the air formed many tornadoes. It was in no way weaker than the Tidal Cloud Waves Seal. However, Taichi was more causal and there was a lot of room to allow for changes.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>That was a realm, just like how Yehuang Guwu reached a very high realm in the cultivation of the Tiger Form. Or rather, it was a type of Heavenly Dao.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Heavenly Dao was a mysterious existence. It was something which could be seen but not touched. It was a feeling. It was multifarious and there were truly too few people who could really grasp a bit of Dao. Being able to grasp just a little would benefit one for life.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Yehuang Guwu had also reached the Heavenly Dao miraculously after Qing Shui. It could be because of her bloodline and physique that she could actually bring the Tiger Form to a horrifying realm. Or rather, it could be said that she had already reached a brand new height. This was the expansion to a new path.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Yehuang Guwu only needed to cultivate the Tiger Form to be able to attain the False God realm in the future. And as long as she could reach a realm that was high enough, she could even defeat an Early False God as a Peak Martial Emperor. Of course, that would require the realm of her Tiger Form to be brought to greater heights.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>...</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The next day, Qing Shui waited for Old Man Puyang at the Imperial Cuisine Hall. They had agreed for him to head to Puyang Clan to extend the lifespan of that old lady.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Old Man Puyang had not arrived even though it was late in the morning but the people from Yehuang Clan came. It was still Yehuang Duzui and Yehuang Duxing. When they say Qing Shui, they smiled. However, their expressions were very strange.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>When Qing Shui saw the two of them, he was also stunned for a while. He had a strange feeling. Was it about that man? Could it be that they had already gotten news about him?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui welcomed the two of them into the room.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Miraculous Physician Qing, we've mobilized a lot of our powers during this period of time and have even gotten the help from many friends. However, we only managed to get a small lead. This is the reason why we've come today."</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Yehuang Duxing said slowly. He was like his name, awake and intelligent. [1]</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui frowned slightly as he looked at the two of them.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"We'll be honest with you. Yehuang Clan hasn't continued to dive deeper in. The top notch existences in the Dancing Phoenix Continent have already stopped Yehuang Clan. If we were to continue the investigations, it would likely be the end for the Yehuang Clan. That person isn't someone Yehuang Clan can investigate," Yehuang Duxing sighed and said.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>This time around, Qing Shui was stunned. To think that Yehuang Clan didn't even have the rights to investigate... Who on earth was that man and where was he? It was apparent that he wasn't in the Dancing Phoenix Continent and it was impossible for him to be in the Soaring Dragon Continent either.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Then there was only one possibility. The vast and boundless Haohan Continent.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Even though they had gotten a lead, it was nothing and could only affirm his existence as well as the fact that he was very powerful.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Miraculous Physician Qing, that person isn't called Yan Zhongyue, but he looks like the person in your portrait. Therefore, we can't fully affirm it either. After all, there are all sorts of strange things in this world. Could they be two people who looked the same?" Yehuang Duxing tried to sway Qing Shui's thoughts.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Maybe. Sorry to have troubled the two of you." Qing Shui wouldn't think about anymore. It seemed that if he wanted to get to know some of the actual situation, he would need to reach the highest level of the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Even Yehuang Clan, who had Early False Gods had no rights to know of the information. It could only go to show that the other force was very powerful.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>He could have lost his memories. Moreover, it had already been so many years. Could he have married another woman? Could he have forgotten about his mother and about Qing Qing? Did he know of his existence...</strong></p>
 <p><strong>In the future, would there be a day when he would need to fight against him?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui's thoughts were all messed up and neither Yehuang Duzui nor Yehuang Duxing disturbed Qing Shui. Right now, they didn't dare to harbor any thoughts concerning Qing Shui. Even if they were to work together, it would just be a normal collaboration.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"I'll still have to thank of the two of you. The time may come when I'll be leaving this place and heading for the continent's capital." Qing Shui made his words very clear. He would be leaving at anytime and there was no need for them to pursue any form of collaboration between them. They hadn't managed to get any concrete news about the man.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Yehuang Duzui and Yehuang Duzui could only leave it at that. If Qing Shui and the man were really father and son, to which there was an extremely high possibility, putting aside the fact that they might accept each other again as family, it would be very easy for them to destroy Yehuang Clan if they had the intention to do so. Even if they were to ignore that man and his abilities, just this young man before them had unlimited potential. No one could be sure how far he could go in the future. However, Yehuang Clan wouldn't be able to go up against him. It was because even right now, Puyang Clan, Gudu Clan and other clans with False God cultivators already had a good relationship with him. Therefore, it was better for them to be on good terms with him as much as possible.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Yehuang Duzui and Yehuang Duxing left. Qing Shui went down and saw Old Man Puyang and the little lass seated in a corner on the fourth story. The lass was looking at something outside, occasionally breaking out into crisp laughter. It didn't seem to be abrupt at all but on the contrary, gave a comfortable and soothing feeling. A child's laughter was said to be the best music in the world.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Uncle!"</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Seeing Qing Shui, the lass happily greeted him.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lass often came here and was also very familiar with Li Ji and Yuan Su. The lass, who was precious like crystal, was someone people would easily take a liking to. Moreover, they had arranged for her to be betrothed to Qing Shui's son. At that time, Li Ji had said that if she were to give birth to a daughter, she would also want her daughter to be married to Qing Shui's son. Qing Shui didn't know what to say.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui gave Zhenming a hug and then greeted Old Man Puyang before they headed out.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>In his previous life, there would also be cases where the elders decided for their children to be betrothed to each other while they were still toddlers. Back then, the father of the boy wouldn't be allowed to hug or carry the girl because she would be his son's wife. It was nothing much since the girl was still a kid and the father's daughter-in-law would be like his own daughter as well. However, in some places which tended to be more conservative, it wasn't allowed.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>In this area, the world of the nine continents was more open-minded. The world of the nine continents and the world in Qing Shui's previous life were on the forefront in different areas.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Puyang Clan was located very near and was a clan that had kept a relatively low profile. However, keeping a low profile didn't mean that no one knew about them. On the contrary, quite a number of people knew about them. With so many people gossiping amongst themselves, Puyang Clan would definitely be in the top three amongst the clans which people discussed the most about. The clan had strict rules and members of the clan weren't allowed to be arrogant and throw their weight about outside just because of their clan's background. It could be because the clan had strict rules that Puyang Clan's abilities continued to soar.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>They entered from the back door. The environment was very refined and quiet. It wasn't very big but not a single person could be seen. The Puyang Clan was a big clan and their manor was very big. This was basically a small courtyard at the back and wasn't connected to the rest of the Puyang Clan.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Probably many people weren't aware that someone was staying here!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>There were some vine-typed plants like the Boston Ivy. The courtyard wasn't big but size was something relative. It still took up over one mu in area. All the necessary facilities were present and although it appeared to be old, there was a rustic feeling to the place.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>An old lady sat on a deck chair, eyes closed and resting. She was extremely thin and was past her prime. However, she exuded an indescribable aura. As she laid there, she appeared to be very much at peace, just like the most ordinary old lady. Yet, she also gave off the feeling that she wasn't ordinary.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>At that moment, the old lady opened her eyes. Her eyes were very calm, with faint hints of a smile in them. The world weariness that was reflected in her eyes was the traces of her life.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Old Ancestor!"</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lass pounced over happily and the old lady casually caught her. Just through this action alone, Qing Shui could see a kind of mysterious power that was gentle yet natural.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Natural!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Way of Nature. It seemed that the old lady's realm was very high. This should be a slightly higher realm than an Early False God cultivator.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Old Ancestor!" Old Man Puyang greeted her respectfully.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"This little one pays his respect to senior." Qing Shui greeted her respectfully. Puyang Clan's expert deserved respect. One of the reasons Puyang Clan could be like what it was now, was definitely due to this Old Ancestor.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Young man, you're the one of the most outstanding people I've met over so many years. You have a bright future before you. I heard that your primary focus is in medicine but it seems that Qing`er is wrong." The old lady smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Puyang Qing was the name of Old Man Puyang.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Senior really has discerning eyes. I actually learn a lot of different things. I don't know what I primarily cultivate either. It's just like how I'm a blacksmith but my hammer technique, which I use for forging, can also be used to deal with my enemies. Therefore, I feel that Dao is multifarious and there's no need to be a stickler on what I learn. As long as I can attain Dao, learning anything would be the same. All routes will lead back to the same source. In the end, the result achieved would all be the same." Qing Shui gave it some thought before he said seriously.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"You spoke well. For one so young to have some understanding, it is very rare. In this area alone, you're much stronger than many of your age, including an old monster like myself." The old lady nodded.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Old Master should already have brought this up to you. The reason I'm here today is to extend your lifespan."</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Extend my lifespan? That's very tough. Although I still appear to be very powerful, my vitality has come to an end. Nothing will work anymore." The old lady's expression was very calm, as if she no longer thought much of life and death.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Then what if I can recover and reignite some of your vitality, clearing some of the sedimented impurities and hidden illness in your body? It's just that to do all these, I'll need your cooperation."</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Hmm? Other alchemists and physicians have also brought this up before. This isn't something to be surprised about. Even I know about it. Are you sure that you'll be able to get rid of some of these?" The old lady looked at Qing Shui curiously. After all, Puyang Qing's change was already considered a tremendous impact. It was just that Puyang Qing wasn't a False God cultivator.</strong></p>

 <p><strong>[1] The characters 'Du' and 'Xing' in this case, likely refers to 'being the only' and 'awake' respectively. Together, they can be interpreted as being the only one who's awake.</strong></p>
