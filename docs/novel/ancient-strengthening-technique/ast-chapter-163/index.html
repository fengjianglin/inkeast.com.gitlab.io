  <p><strong>AST 0163 – Arriving At The Skysword Sect</strong></p>
  <p>After some time, Qing Shui returned to his senses and saw that Wenren Wu-Shuang was looking at him teasingly. It was rare that his delicate face turned red in front of Wu-Shuang. For women, seeing a guy’s embarrassment had the same charm and attraction as a woman’s.</p>
  <p>“What a perfect lady. Even I can’t help but feel jealous when I see her.” Wu-Shuang smiled and said as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“What are you jealous of? It’s not as if she is prettier than you.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“You’re not being honest. You were in a stupor when you looked at her earlier. You are never like that when you’re with me. Look at the amount of people here who are still stunned by her beauty. When did I ever cause such a commotion before?” Wu-Shuang blinked her beautiful eyes as she smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“That is because she has the Golden Winged Thunder Condor with her and some other factors. If you had such a strong demonic beast as well, you would also be able to do the same. It would be the same even if I was the one in her position. I remember how I was just as astonished as when I first saw you. The one image that I love the most is the posture you had when you were taking a bath, tsk tsk.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p>Wu-Shuang was initially both annoyed and happy, but in the end, she was so embarrassed that she could not show her face. Her eyes misted as she said displeasingly, “You rascal. I forbid you from mentioning this in the future.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s only reply to Wu-Shuang were his chuckles!</p>
  <p>The two of them continued their random walk. Occasionally, there were people who looked at this well-matched couple. While there were those who admired them, there were also others who were jealous and had let their lechery get the better of them.</p>
  <p>“Young Master Pan, did you see? It’s that lady there. How is she? She doesn’t lose out to the reigning exquisite beauty of Earthly Paradise, right?” An arrogant voice spoke out.</p>
  <p>“Tsk tsk. Plum blossoms, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum all have their individual strengths! Damn it, I can’t have the other lady but I must definitely get my hands on this one.” A slightly high pitched voice spoke out. While his voice was very soft, it did not escape Qing Shui’s sharp ears.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui frowned as he looked towards the source of the voice. He saw a few brightly clothed fellows looking at him and Wenren Wu-Shuang. The one in front was a handsome young man. One could tell that he was from a well-off family judging from his look of arrogance.</p>
  <p>“Miss, my name is Pan Long. I’m pleased to be able to meet you. I feel that fate has brought us together and I was wondering if I can have the honor of inviting you to the Pan Residence so that I can be a host?” The youth used a soft and gentle voice as he spoke to Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>“I’m sorry, but we still have matters to attend to and need to rush off. We would appreciate it if you guys could make way for us.” Wu-Shuang hoped to keep matters low in hope of not offending people while they were still new to the place. After all, this was not Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p>“Miss, our Young Master Pan is the Young Master of the Pan Clan and is quite a reputable figure in the West Gate of the Cang Lang Country. The eldest Young Master Pan is also the Protector of the Skysword Sect.” Standing behind the young master, a thin man that goes by the name Pan Long had a sneaky look as he smiled and said to Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>“I’m sorry again, but we’re in a rush for time!” Hearing the Skysword Sect, Wu-Shuang unconsciously felt a sense of pride and was stunned for a short moment before she replied.</p>
  <p>Upon hearing the Skysword Sect, Qing Shui was stunned for a moment before he smiled.</p>
  <p>This expression felt different in Pan Long’s eyes. It was not the first time he had seen this expression. Usually, there would be a higher chance of success when this expression appeared. Once they entered Pan Residence, he would be able to make the ladies listen to him.</p>
  <p>“She already said that we’re in a rush for time. Why are you being so long-winded and holding us back? Please make way.” Qing Shui held onto Wu-Shuang’s hand as if he was showing off and said sluggishly.</p>
  <p>“Young chap, this is the West Gate. You better think this over. Our Young Master Pan is graciously offering his generosity.. You better not force us to give you the tough way out when we’re giving an easier way.” The thin man said as he smiled threateningly. He was used to being arrogant, so why should he stand the berating from Qing Shui who was obviously a foreigner.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t want to make a fuss. While the Skysword Sect was the leading sect in Cang Lang Country, who would know if there were any other hidden experts around? Moreover, no one would know what had happened here. If he were killed, the loss would outweigh the gain. Hearing that the Pan Clan still relies on the status of a Protector from Skysword Sect, he was no longer afraid. Even if this person would be family in the future, he would still need to give him a bashing.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not know that the status of Skysword Sect’s Protector was very reputable in Cang Lang Country. Pan Long had relied on “My elder brother Pan Yan is the Protector of Skysword Sect” to reap a lot of benefits around West Gate.</p>
  <p>Since he knew this person’s identity, Qing Shui no longer needed to go easy. “Tough way out? Scram off.” Qing Shui smiled and directly landed a heavy slap, sending the thin young man flying.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui. Forget it, let’s go.” Wu-Shuang tugged on Qing shui lightly and said.</p>
  <p>“Rascal, leaving after beating someone up?” Pan Long had never been this disrespected before. While the Pan Clan was not considered some super big clan, they were still well-known in the West Gate for the past hundred years.</p>
  <p>In addition, the head of the Pan Clan was on good terms with the city lord. He was also the one who always got his way in the West Gate.</p>
  <p>“Leave? Why would I leave before beating you up?” Qing Shui smirked and gave him a tough bashing. This group of useless people had relied on the reputation of their family to throw their weight around. They continued to bully the weak, but were terrified of the strong. While they took advantage of the kind-hearted commoners, they had nothing themselves. Their cultivation was so weak that it was pitiful.</p>
  <p>While there were those who were at the Martial Commander level and a few who were at the pinnacle of the Martial Commander level, Qing Shui had easily dealt with them.</p>
  <p>Pan Long was now full of regret. The middle-aged man, who was at the pinnacle of the Martial Commander level and had protected Pan Long, had told his master that the young lad was a Xiantian expert and that he had no means to fight back.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui easily left with Wu-Shuang and headed directly for Skysword Sect. Qing Shui could not help but smile when he recalled the bashed up state that Pan Long had been left in.</p>
  <p>“To think that this toad lusts after a swan’s flesh. Does he really think that he can compare to a toad like me?” Qing Shui said happily.</p>
  <p>“Pfft!” Wenren Wu-Shuang charmingly bursted out laughing at Qing Shui’s words.</p>
  <p>“Who would describe himself like this?”</p>
  <p>Three days later!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the Skysword Mountain in the Cang Lang Country which extends for a thousand li. The mountain range was inclined as if a giant sword was pointing towards the sky. This was the reason for its name, Skysword Mountain.</p>
  <p>The biggest clan of Cang Long Country, the Skysword Sect, was at the zenith of the Skysword Mountain – the Skysword Peak!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Wu-Shuang followed the rough cliff and the almost non-existent “mountain path” to reach the halfway point at Skysword Peak. Only then did they know that there was a wide and tall staircase leading up to the peak. The staircase leading into the clouds made Qing Shui become filled with awe at the gigantic scale of the project.</p>
  <p>“Who goes there?”</p>
  <p>The staircase leading to the clouds was winding and curvy, as if it was a winding and hovering dragon. When they were turning at a corner, a holler echoed out and was followed by the appearance of two youths clad in yellow.</p>
  <p>“I am Qing Shui from Hundred Miles City, the disciple of Yiye Jiange. I would appreciate it you two brothers could help me notify the sect of my arrival.”</p>
  <p>“You are Qing Shui? Martial Aunt Jiange’s only disciple?” The youth asked in astonishment.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned, “You know of me?”</p>
  <p>“Of course I do. Almost everyone in the Skysword Sect knows. Martial Aunt Jian Ge had said that she would not be accepting any more disciples. Now, everyone wishes to know what kind of influential man had been able to change the mind of the great Martial Aunt Jiange.”</p>

 <p>Qing Shui and Wu-Shuang followed the rough cliff and the almost non-existent “mountain path” to reach the halfway point at Skysword Peak. Only then did they know that there was a wide and tall staircase leading up to the peak. The staircase leading into the clouds made Qing Shui become filled with awe at the gigantic scale of the project.</p>
 <p>“Who goes there?”</p>
 <p>The staircase leading to the clouds was winding and curvy, as if it was a winding and hovering dragon. When they were turning at a corner, a holler echoed out and was followed by the appearance of two youths clad in yellow.</p>
 <p>“I am Qing Shui from Hundred Miles City, the disciple of Yiye Jiange. I would appreciate it you two brothers could help me notify the sect of my arrival.”</p>
 <p>“You are Qing Shui? Martial Aunt Jiange’s only disciple?” The youth asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned, “You know of me?”</p>
 <p>“Of course I do. Almost everyone in the Skysword Sect knows. Martial Aunt Jian Ge had said that she would not be accepting any more disciples. Now, everyone wishes to know what kind of influential man had been able to change the mind of the great Martial Aunt Jiange.”</p>
