 <p><strong>Chapter 481 The fourth Portrait of Beauty, the sealed Violet Gold Divine Shield.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 481 - The fourth Portrait of Beauty, the sealed Violet Gold Divine Shield&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw what he had in his hands, he was shocked!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Portrait of Beauty!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The fourth Portrait of Beauty!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could never have imaged that there was a Portrait of Beauty in Feng Shamo’s Interspatial silk sachet. Furthermore, it was kept by Feng Shamo as a treasure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know when other people got their hands on the Portrait of Beauty, whether they would have those strange dreams. Qing Shui only knew that whoever got their hands on them, they would treat it like a treasure. After all, it does write that the women in the portraits were all Divine Bodies, treasures. Although there were no specifics, they would still treasure them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although he was shocked at Feng Shamo having this Portrait of Beauty, as far as treasuring it, Qing Shui could understand why. Just this one single portrait could already cause one to go frantic, even just looking at the portrait can raise one’s spirit energy and understanding of mystical concepts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Portraits of Beauty were always made out of this kind of thin demonic beast hide that was like silk, Qing Shui could feel that the demonic beast skin was at least of the Martial Saint level, this was because the demonic beast skin from earlier, was inferior to the beast skin used for the Portraits of Beauty.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui excited opened this fourth Portrait of Beauty and as he was slowly opening it, he could feel a great sense of excitement, even though he did not know why.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although the women in the Portraits of Beauty were all treasures, the benefits were unknown, just one Divine Body already caused people to go frantic. When Qing Shui thought about the three other Portraits of Beauty, he felt a little dispirited.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was one of the women of the Portraits of Beauty, she was his master as well. Qing Shui could only think of how to repay the kindness she had shown him, he did not have any improper thought about her. Although men are lecherous, but there is a limit. Everybody, even the wicked, had their own principles and taboos.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress, this was the First Portrait of Beauty Qing Shui found, she had likewise been a tremendous help to him, he wanted to repay the grace she had shown him. In front of her, Qing Shui could feel a sense of helplessness deep inside, but Qing Shui did not know what he could do for her as her background remained very mysterious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword Demon Huang Qing! Qing Shui did not know what to feel towards this woman from the Second Portrait of Beauty. He did not know if this special character from the Sword Tower will become an obstruction when he goes to step over the Sword Tower.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui thought that by obtaining the Portraits of Beauty, he would at least obtain great help from the women in the portraits. Qing Shui assumed that this was one of the benefits of the Portraits of Beauty, but Sword Demon Huang Qing lead Qing Shui to be confused.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could it be that after getting the Portraits of Beauty, if the women in it did not become a great help to him, they would become a great obstruction?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui started blankly, he was taken back by his own thoughts!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Currently, she was only obstruction in his plans to flatten Sword Tower. This was currently Qing Shui’s biggest obstruction. In the past, he had conflicts with Sword Tower, only by trampling over them then he could achieve the peak in the Greencloud Con</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only, the sudden appearance of Huang Qing caused him to feel unsettled. Qing Shui did not know why he had these thoughts, but it seemed that he had realized something.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall Palace Mistress?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had always felt that he could not sense her true power, although he had vaguely sensed that she had the strength of three countries. However after Qing Shui broke through, it felt like that there was a mysterious veil covering her. The vague feeling he had before, became even more so.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, the one Qing Shui was the most puzzled about was Yiye Jiange. At the start, Qing Shui was not able to see through her strength, it was later that he found out she was a Grade Four Xiantian, however, there was no bit of change over the next few years.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What led Qing Shui to be puzzled was in the fact that it was impossible for her to not have any progress at all. It goes to show that things were not as simple as they seemed. He had the intentions of investigating it when he had the opportunity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for Huang Qing, Qing Shui did not know, in their first exchange, the gap between them was huge, thus he did not know what level of strength she had, or more accurately, he did not know her exact level of strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kneading his forehead, Qing Shui temporarily did not want to think about these troublesome things, at this moment, the Portrait of Beauty had already been gently opened.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, the thin as silk Portrait of Beauty opened, Qing Shui was shocked again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The women looked to be in her twenties and had an absolutely enchanting face. She felt like a refreshing spring breeze, a little cute, yet had a gentle girl next door look.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her sharp eyes had a clear radiance and her tiny sexy mouth had a faint of a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Glossy black hair draped over her shoulders, adding to her charm. &nbsp;The snow-white dress could not hide her delicate curvy figure, her straight white calves had a charming luster, she had a pair of jade-like feet, her charming toes looked like nutmeg, the observing Qing Shui had an urge to play with them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even without makeup, she still was peerlessly magnificent! This was a woman whose aura resembled that of a snow lotus!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wu-shuang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was actually that absolute beauty, the first women that Qing Shui met, and also the most beautiful. Only, Qing Shui did not expect it to be her, although Qing Shui did not doubt her beauty, it just caused him to be a little surprised.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thinking to when he was stunned upon meeting Wenren Wu-shuang for the first time, even more so, to when he had gain insights when he was rapped by her knuckles…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gained insights to the relevant alchemy…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but feel stupid, he felt that this woman was the most sincere. The fact that she had given him tremendous help, was a key point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hung up the Fourth Portraits of Beauty beside the earlier three Portraits of Beauty! Suddenly looking at the four suspended Portraits of Beauty, Qing Shui felt like he was in a dream.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Already the fourth portrait, more importantly, Qing Shui had met the women in all four of them, this made Qing Shui feel that it was weird. What lead Qing Shui to be depressed, was that till now, none of them belonged to him yet…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Wenren Wu-shuang said she would marry him, but the death of Wenren Wu-gou caused her personality to change greatly. Now, Qing Shui only wanted to find a way for her to recover from her grief.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel a headache coming on when thinking about these things. After a period of time, QIng Shui intended to bring Wenren Wu-shuang out, even if not by his side, at least be with Canghai Mingyue and the other girls.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly he thought about Zhu Qing, that clingy mature woman, Qing Shui shook his head, trying to temporarily forget about it, he would deal with it when the situation arrives!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There are still a few items that I have not taken out yet!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui took that Portrait of Beauty, he had forgotten that were a few more items and he hurried over and took out what looked like a large metallic object.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s a big one!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the violet shield in front of him, standing at the height of one person, one meter wide, one inch thick…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What lead Qing Shui to be surprised was in the spiritual energy fluctuations it was emiting, there was also a strong domineering air. It only took Qing Shui a moment to recognize that this was an extraordinary object. After taking it out, Qing Shui was wild with joy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just the weight of this large violet shield was 100 thousand Jin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just the height of a person, one meter wide, one inch thick of metal could reach a horrifying weight of 100 thousand Jin!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What kind of metal is this? To think that it could be this heavy?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui’s body was currently weak, with half a day of rest, he still could pick up 100 thousand Jin of weight, this was the results of Qing Shui’s terrifying recovery abilities.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, no one would believe it, or else Qing Shui would not have been confined in his room!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A very strong Shield, Qing Shui really liked it. Before, in the battle with Feng Shamo, he used the Heaven Shaking Hammer as a shield. That battle allowed Qing Shui to be more familiar with using simple shield strikes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Strike, is does not adds to the attacking power but has an repulsing effect!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One repulsion was already very strong. A battle is ever changing, once you lose your balance, it could result in a fatal error.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Through the spiritual energy of the violet shield, Qing Shui knew that this was the good stuff.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only took the violet shield and placed it on the ground, he could not help but to use the Heavenly Vision Technique to check it out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui had a wonderful feeling, his mind was cleansed and he felt as though the Heavenly Vision Technique had some subtle changes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like a short-sighted person putting on glasses, the feeling was good, Qing Shui liked the feeling. He then focused on the violet shield once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Violet Gold Divine Shield: An ancient lost item of the World of the Nine Continents, has mystical effects!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effects: the person using the Violet Gold Divine Shield will have and increase in 50% of physical strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Inherent technique: Divine Armor, Can defend against 50% of the opponent’s damage for 1 hour.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Passive skill: Divine Bash, when using the Violet Gold Divine Shield to bash, there will be an addition 20% of the body’s strength added to the attack.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">So powerful, Qing Shui felt like he struck a jackpot, he was initially planning to look for a shield, or even make one himself, what timing……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui realised a problem, why did Feng Shamo not use this Violet Gold Divine Shield? Qing Shui felt that it was strange.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suspiciously looked at the Violet Gold Divine Shield again, remembering that he had not seen everything yet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Huh, usage requirement?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finally knew why Feng Shamo did not use it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Usage requirement: the body’s strength has to reach the strength of 1 country</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The user of the Violet Gold Divine Shield will have a 50% decrease in speed</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Status: Sealed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sealed?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Violet Gold Divine Shield, not knowing whether to be happy or dejected. This Violet Gold Divine Shield is extremely strong, but had a fatal weakness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Speed reduction of 50%</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A decrease of half a person’s speed, who could endure that?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, there was the requirement of the body’s strength to be at the strength of one country, this requirement was particularly harsh but most cultivators should be able to achieve it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now knew why Feng Shamo did not use it, not to mention of hitting the requirement of one country of strength, if he used the Violet Gold Divine Shield, in addition to the Art of Pursuing and Binding Talisman…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now felt depressed, such a good, strong Violet Gold Divine Shield. It’s a pity that this one attribute would cause most people to reject it. Even if it was stronger, no one would use it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Speed is strength, speed is more important than strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although it reduces speed, but under special circumstances, it can be used to block attacks for an hour, such as when in a small cave, the Violet Gold Divine Shield can be used to block attacks from arrows or demonic beast…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such a pity that the opportunities to use it are too few!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sealed?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly thought of this attribute, he immediately saw a glimmer of hope. Is the effect of 50% reduction in speed caused by the sealing, if so, can unsealing it remove this attribute of reducing speed?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ancient Art of Forging?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of the Ancient Art of Forging, if he used the Ancient Art of Forging to refine it once, would there be any effects?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A pity that that his wounds have not healed yet, he could only wait till he is healed before he can he experiment. If only he could remove the seal, Qing Shui felt excited just at the thought of it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui did not harbour any big hopes, or else his disappointment will be bigger if it fails.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking again, Qing Shui was already satisfies, for now, he will just treat it as an accessory.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing that the Interspatial silk sachet was almost empty, Qing Shui directly took the remaining few items out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hey!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Beast Parchment?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a good feeling about it, because on this kinds of items, it was usually a alchemic recipe, technique or a treasure map.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Dantian Strengthening Pallet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Oh, Alchemy Recipe!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui never expected it to be an Alchemy Recipe, looking at the other stuff he took out, there was two similar leather parchment and a small bottle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked towards his right hand!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Vitality Pill Alchemy Recipe!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Recipe: Core, blood, bones of Tiger type Xiantian demonic beast, 3000-year old turtle blood, 2000-year old &nbsp;Blood Coral, 1000-year old Jinying Flower, 500-year old Thoroughwort Herb, 100-year old Fire Koi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effect: Every pill increases the consumer’s strength by 1000 Jin, slight effect of strengthening bones, consumption of pellets is limited to 10 per year.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha!” Qing Shui had been looking for an alchemic recipe like this. He has been wanting to raise the strength of his Qing Clan. Qing Shui felt that most Alchemy recipes are strong, but the consumption limit was too low, thus, he had not found a suitable Medicinal Pill yet. Qing Shui looked down on those which were too weak, in fact, prolonged consumption of those would result in a resistance to the Medicinal Pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With this Tiger Vitality Pill, he could raise the strength of the Qing Clan within a year. Although this Tiger Vitality Pill was not a top grade Medicinal Pill, to Xiantian and before cultivators, it was better than the Small Revitalizing Pellet. Furthermore, it can be eaten 10 times a year, and can even be eaten for a few years, although it would not be important by then, he would be able to find other Medicinal Pallet during this time. Once they broke past Xiantian, Qing Shui would have other Medicinal Pills for them. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One more parchment?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tri-Acupoint Clearing Pallet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Recipe: Golden Lida Flower, 5000-year old turtle blood, 3000-year old Lingzhi, 3000-year old Demonic beast's core, Blood Essence Flower, Starry flower, 1000-year old Clinopodium Herb.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effects: Open the Zhiyin, Kunlun, Shenmai acupoints!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were all acupoints of the leg!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not care which acupoint is was, was long as it can clear the acupoints. This Alchemy Recipe is pretty good, from what Qing Shui heard, most acupoint clearing Pallets can only clear one acupoint. Pellets like these that can clear 3 acupoints were very good, just that the ingredients were all very precious. Good thing Qing Shui had the Heaven defying Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, or else he could only stare blankly at the recipe.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui just realised that he still had not looked at the recipe for the Dantian Strengthening Pallet that he was holding in his left hand! He quickly looked at the recipe in his left hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Dantian Strengthening Pallet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Recipe: 5000-year old Lingzhi, 5000-year old turtle blood, 5000-year old Demonic beast's core, 5000-year old Demonic beast's bones, Flower of Life, Asura Flower,5000-year old Demonic beast's tendons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effects: Strengthens the Dantian by 20%, only one pill can be eaten!&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 481 - The fourth Portrait of Beauty, the sealed Violet Gold Divine Shield&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw what he had in his hands, he was shocked!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Portrait of Beauty!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The fourth Portrait of Beauty!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could never have imaged that there was a Portrait of Beauty in Feng Shamo’s Interspatial silk sachet. Furthermore, it was kept by Feng Shamo as a treasure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know when other people got their hands on the Portrait of Beauty, whether they would have those strange dreams. Qing Shui only knew that whoever got their hands on them, they would treat it like a treasure. After all, it does write that the women in the portraits were all Divine Bodies, treasures. Although there were no specifics, they would still treasure them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although he was shocked at Feng Shamo having this Portrait of Beauty, as far as treasuring it, Qing Shui could understand why. Just this one single portrait could already cause one to go frantic, even just looking at the portrait can raise one’s spirit energy and understanding of mystical concepts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Portraits of Beauty were always made out of this kind of thin demonic beast hide that was like silk, Qing Shui could feel that the demonic beast skin was at least of the Martial Saint level, this was because the demonic beast skin from earlier, was inferior to the beast skin used for the Portraits of Beauty.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui excited opened this fourth Portrait of Beauty and as he was slowly opening it, he could feel a great sense of excitement, even though he did not know why.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although the women in the Portraits of Beauty were all treasures, the benefits were unknown, just one Divine Body already caused people to go frantic. When Qing Shui thought about the three other Portraits of Beauty, he felt a little dispirited.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was one of the women of the Portraits of Beauty, she was his master as well. Qing Shui could only think of how to repay the kindness she had shown him, he did not have any improper thought about her. Although men are lecherous, but there is a limit. Everybody, even the wicked, had their own principles and taboos.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress, this was the First Portrait of Beauty Qing Shui found, she had likewise been a tremendous help to him, he wanted to repay the grace she had shown him. In front of her, Qing Shui could feel a sense of helplessness deep inside, but Qing Shui did not know what he could do for her as her background remained very mysterious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword Demon Huang Qing! Qing Shui did not know what to feel towards this woman from the Second Portrait of Beauty. He did not know if this special character from the Sword Tower will become an obstruction when he goes to step over the Sword Tower.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui thought that by obtaining the Portraits of Beauty, he would at least obtain great help from the women in the portraits. Qing Shui assumed that this was one of the benefits of the Portraits of Beauty, but Sword Demon Huang Qing lead Qing Shui to be confused.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Could it be that after getting the Portraits of Beauty, if the women in it did not become a great help to him, they would become a great obstruction?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui started blankly, he was taken back by his own thoughts!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Currently, she was only obstruction in his plans to flatten Sword Tower. This was currently Qing Shui’s biggest obstruction. In the past, he had conflicts with Sword Tower, only by trampling over them then he could achieve the peak in the Greencloud Con</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only, the sudden appearance of Huang Qing caused him to feel unsettled. Qing Shui did not know why he had these thoughts, but it seemed that he had realized something.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall Palace Mistress?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had always felt that he could not sense her true power, although he had vaguely sensed that she had the strength of three countries. However after Qing Shui broke through, it felt like that there was a mysterious veil covering her. The vague feeling he had before, became even more so.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, the one Qing Shui was the most puzzled about was Yiye Jiange. At the start, Qing Shui was not able to see through her strength, it was later that he found out she was a Grade Four Xiantian, however, there was no bit of change over the next few years.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What led Qing Shui to be puzzled was in the fact that it was impossible for her to not have any progress at all. It goes to show that things were not as simple as they seemed. He had the intentions of investigating it when he had the opportunity.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for Huang Qing, Qing Shui did not know, in their first exchange, the gap between them was huge, thus he did not know what level of strength she had, or more accurately, he did not know her exact level of strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kneading his forehead, Qing Shui temporarily did not want to think about these troublesome things, at this moment, the Portrait of Beauty had already been gently opened.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, the thin as silk Portrait of Beauty opened, Qing Shui was shocked again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The women looked to be in her twenties and had an absolutely enchanting face. She felt like a refreshing spring breeze, a little cute, yet had a gentle girl next door look.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her sharp eyes had a clear radiance and her tiny sexy mouth had a faint of a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Glossy black hair draped over her shoulders, adding to her charm. &nbsp;The snow-white dress could not hide her delicate curvy figure, her straight white calves had a charming luster, she had a pair of jade-like feet, her charming toes looked like nutmeg, the observing Qing Shui had an urge to play with them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even without makeup, she still was peerlessly magnificent! This was a woman whose aura resembled that of a snow lotus!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wu-shuang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was actually that absolute beauty, the first women that Qing Shui met, and also the most beautiful. Only, Qing Shui did not expect it to be her, although Qing Shui did not doubt her beauty, it just caused him to be a little surprised.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thinking to when he was stunned upon meeting Wenren Wu-shuang for the first time, even more so, to when he had gain insights when he was rapped by her knuckles…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gained insights to the relevant alchemy…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but feel stupid, he felt that this woman was the most sincere. The fact that she had given him tremendous help, was a key point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hung up the Fourth Portraits of Beauty beside the earlier three Portraits of Beauty! Suddenly looking at the four suspended Portraits of Beauty, Qing Shui felt like he was in a dream.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Already the fourth portrait, more importantly, Qing Shui had met the women in all four of them, this made Qing Shui feel that it was weird. What lead Qing Shui to be depressed, was that till now, none of them belonged to him yet…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Wenren Wu-shuang said she would marry him, but the death of Wenren Wu-gou caused her personality to change greatly. Now, Qing Shui only wanted to find a way for her to recover from her grief.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel a headache coming on when thinking about these things. After a period of time, QIng Shui intended to bring Wenren Wu-shuang out, even if not by his side, at least be with Canghai Mingyue and the other girls.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly he thought about Zhu Qing, that clingy mature woman, Qing Shui shook his head, trying to temporarily forget about it, he would deal with it when the situation arrives!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There are still a few items that I have not taken out yet!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui took that Portrait of Beauty, he had forgotten that were a few more items and he hurried over and took out what looked like a large metallic object.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s a big one!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the violet shield in front of him, standing at the height of one person, one meter wide, one inch thick…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What lead Qing Shui to be surprised was in the spiritual energy fluctuations it was emiting, there was also a strong domineering air. It only took Qing Shui a moment to recognize that this was an extraordinary object. After taking it out, Qing Shui was wild with joy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just the weight of this large violet shield was 100 thousand Jin.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just the height of a person, one meter wide, one inch thick of metal could reach a horrifying weight of 100 thousand Jin!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What kind of metal is this? To think that it could be this heavy?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui’s body was currently weak, with half a day of rest, he still could pick up 100 thousand Jin of weight, this was the results of Qing Shui’s terrifying recovery abilities.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, no one would believe it, or else Qing Shui would not have been confined in his room!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A very strong Shield, Qing Shui really liked it. Before, in the battle with Feng Shamo, he used the Heaven Shaking Hammer as a shield. That battle allowed Qing Shui to be more familiar with using simple shield strikes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Strike, is does not adds to the attacking power but has an repulsing effect!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One repulsion was already very strong. A battle is ever changing, once you lose your balance, it could result in a fatal error.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Through the spiritual energy of the violet shield, Qing Shui knew that this was the good stuff.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only took the violet shield and placed it on the ground, he could not help but to use the Heavenly Vision Technique to check it out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui had a wonderful feeling, his mind was cleansed and he felt as though the Heavenly Vision Technique had some subtle changes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like a short-sighted person putting on glasses, the feeling was good, Qing Shui liked the feeling. He then focused on the violet shield once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Violet Gold Divine Shield: An ancient lost item of the World of the Nine Continents, has mystical effects!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effects: the person using the Violet Gold Divine Shield will have and increase in 50% of physical strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Inherent technique: Divine Armor, Can defend against 50% of the opponent’s damage for 1 hour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Passive skill: Divine Bash, when using the Violet Gold Divine Shield to bash, there will be an addition 20% of the body’s strength added to the attack.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">So powerful, Qing Shui felt like he struck a jackpot, he was initially planning to look for a shield, or even make one himself, what timing……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui realised a problem, why did Feng Shamo not use this Violet Gold Divine Shield? Qing Shui felt that it was strange.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suspiciously looked at the Violet Gold Divine Shield again, remembering that he had not seen everything yet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Huh, usage requirement?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finally knew why Feng Shamo did not use it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Usage requirement: the body’s strength has to reach the strength of 1 country</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The user of the Violet Gold Divine Shield will have a 50% decrease in speed</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Status: Sealed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sealed?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Violet Gold Divine Shield, not knowing whether to be happy or dejected. This Violet Gold Divine Shield is extremely strong, but had a fatal weakness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Speed reduction of 50%</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A decrease of half a person’s speed, who could endure that?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, there was the requirement of the body’s strength to be at the strength of one country, this requirement was particularly harsh but most cultivators should be able to achieve it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now knew why Feng Shamo did not use it, not to mention of hitting the requirement of one country of strength, if he used the Violet Gold Divine Shield, in addition to the Art of Pursuing and Binding Talisman…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now felt depressed, such a good, strong Violet Gold Divine Shield. It’s a pity that this one attribute would cause most people to reject it. Even if it was stronger, no one would use it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Speed is strength, speed is more important than strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although it reduces speed, but under special circumstances, it can be used to block attacks for an hour, such as when in a small cave, the Violet Gold Divine Shield can be used to block attacks from arrows or demonic beast…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Such a pity that the opportunities to use it are too few!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sealed?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly thought of this attribute, he immediately saw a glimmer of hope. Is the effect of 50% reduction in speed caused by the sealing, if so, can unsealing it remove this attribute of reducing speed?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ancient Art of Forging?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of the Ancient Art of Forging, if he used the Ancient Art of Forging to refine it once, would there be any effects?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A pity that that his wounds have not healed yet, he could only wait till he is healed before he can he experiment. If only he could remove the seal, Qing Shui felt excited just at the thought of it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui did not harbour any big hopes, or else his disappointment will be bigger if it fails.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking again, Qing Shui was already satisfies, for now, he will just treat it as an accessory.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing that the Interspatial silk sachet was almost empty, Qing Shui directly took the remaining few items out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hey!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Beast Parchment?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a good feeling about it, because on this kinds of items, it was usually a alchemic recipe, technique or a treasure map.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dantian Strengthening Pallet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Oh, Alchemy Recipe!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui never expected it to be an Alchemy Recipe, looking at the other stuff he took out, there was two similar leather parchment and a small bottle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked towards his right hand!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Vitality Pill Alchemy Recipe!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Recipe: Core, blood, bones of Tiger type Xiantian demonic beast, 3000-year old turtle blood, 2000-year old &nbsp;Blood Coral, 1000-year old Jinying Flower, 500-year old Thoroughwort Herb, 100-year old Fire Koi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effect: Every pill increases the consumer’s strength by 1000 Jin, slight effect of strengthening bones, consumption of pellets is limited to 10 per year.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha!” Qing Shui had been looking for an alchemic recipe like this. He has been wanting to raise the strength of his Qing Clan. Qing Shui felt that most Alchemy recipes are strong, but the consumption limit was too low, thus, he had not found a suitable Medicinal Pill yet. Qing Shui looked down on those which were too weak, in fact, prolonged consumption of those would result in a resistance to the Medicinal Pills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With this Tiger Vitality Pill, he could raise the strength of the Qing Clan within a year. Although this Tiger Vitality Pill was not a top grade Medicinal Pill, to Xiantian and before cultivators, it was better than the Small Revitalizing Pellet. Furthermore, it can be eaten 10 times a year, and can even be eaten for a few years, although it would not be important by then, he would be able to find other Medicinal Pallet during this time. Once they broke past Xiantian, Qing Shui would have other Medicinal Pills for them. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One more parchment?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tri-Acupoint Clearing Pallet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Recipe: Golden Lida Flower, 5000-year old turtle blood, 3000-year old Lingzhi, 3000-year old Demonic beast's core, Blood Essence Flower, Starry flower, 1000-year old Clinopodium Herb.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effects: Open the Zhiyin, Kunlun, Shenmai acupoints!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were all acupoints of the leg!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not care which acupoint is was, was long as it can clear the acupoints. This Alchemy Recipe is pretty good, from what Qing Shui heard, most acupoint clearing Pallets can only clear one acupoint. Pellets like these that can clear 3 acupoints were very good, just that the ingredients were all very precious. Good thing Qing Shui had the Heaven defying Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, or else he could only stare blankly at the recipe.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui just realised that he still had not looked at the recipe for the Dantian Strengthening Pallet that he was holding in his left hand! He quickly looked at the recipe in his left hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dantian Strengthening Pallet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Recipe: 5000-year old Lingzhi, 5000-year old turtle blood, 5000-year old Demonic beast's core, 5000-year old Demonic beast's bones, Flower of Life, Asura Flower,5000-year old Demonic beast's tendons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effects: Strengthens the Dantian by 20%, only one pill can be eaten!&nbsp;</p>
