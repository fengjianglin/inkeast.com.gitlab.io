 <p><strong>Chapter 120 Qing Shui’s Demonic Beast, Flaming Bird.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0120 - Yu He’s Charm </strong></p>
  <p><span style>That man pressed into the beautiful young wife under his body. His arms hooked under the woman’s long pair of jade smooth legs to support himself, and to lift her ass up as much as possible. The man’s thick and solid manhood rammed in and pulled out substantially, and he made the woman moan every time he pushed in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just when he finished saying that he’d go satisfy himself with the beautiful young widow who was trading herbs after he finished satisfying this horny bitch, and just when his rod which was going in and out, he didn’t have time to thrust in after moving out, because the man felt a strong wave of pain below him. When he looked down, he was so scared that he fainted. This was because a stone had smashed his manhood into meat pulp.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui left expressionlessly. “This foul-mouthed man. I had intended to kill him at first, but it would probably be better to make life a living hell for him.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Qing Shui left, when the man fainted, his loud cry made the woman who was still engrossed in ecstasy look down at the tragedy below, and then she let out a scream. </span></p>
  <p><span style>In the quiet night, that cry traveled far and wide. Quickly, many people holding torches gathered tens of people and hurriedly ascended the mountain. They might have thought that wild beasts might have climbed up the mountain, so each group hurried up the mountain with their weapons. </span></p>
  <p><span style>When they arrived they saw the devastation on the lower body of the doctor who lost his consciousness, his naked body, and the beautiful young wife whose clothes were in disorder. The previous rumors about their relationship made everyone certain that those two were engaging in shady business. The only question they had now was how the man had lost his most important body part. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You f**king skank, get your ass back here!” Another strong man pulled the beautiful young wife up and dragged her back. Unfortunately, Qing Shui was unable to witness this scene. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The next day, everything went back to normal, but there were a few whispers about someone losing his balls. Qing Shui knew they were talking about that foul-mouthed doctor. There were a few discussions about some vixen having an extramarital affair as well. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The most popular topic was who had crushed the doctor’s balls. Some people suspected it was the beautiful young wife, while others suspected it was the work of the beautiful young wife’s husband. These hypotheses made Qing Shui want to laugh. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Near afternoon, they were nearly done with their herb trade, filling up a carriage completely. With the help of little fatty, they were able to travel with ease. This was because he knew which kinds of herbs each house had, thereby increasing their efficiency. </span></p>
  <p><span style>They quickly finished preparing everything. When they decided to leave, that muscular doctor, supported by a middle-aged woman, arrived in front of Qing Shui. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Divine Doctor, I know your medical skills are divine, so you have to help me!” That doctor already regarded Qing Shui as a Xiantian alchemist, and thought that he could refine pellets that could regenerate body parts. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, what happened to you? Where do you feel uncomfortable?” Qing Shui looked at the clumsy and solid man doubtfully. He gazed all around the man’s body. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry; I am powerless. That thing is already thoroughly destroyed!” Qing Shui shook his head, and spoke with pity. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The surrounding people started to discuss quietly amongst themselves about how the man used to require other women to go to bed with him as a payment for saving people. Soon the man felt so ashamed that he abandoned his thoughts of begging Qing Shui again, and slipped away in a panic. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“As a doctor, you didn’t conduct yourself with dignity. I don’t really care whether you were having affairs, but I couldn’t forgive your bad mouthing, and taking advantage of others at their weakest!” Qing Shui didn’t feel that he had done anything wrong at all!</span></p>
  <p><span style>When they returned, they had little fatty as an extra member. That old man told Qing Shui and Qing Yi many good words about him and then warned the little fatty, “You have to listen to their orders and not create any trouble for them. Keep living, and don’t disappoint your brother’s expectations for you!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I know Grandfather Wu. Thank you and the other grandfathers for your aid all these years!” Little Fatty said gratefully. </span></p>
  <p><span style>On the way back, Qing Shui felt that this trip had really been worth it. He must say that it had the highest worth. They unexpectedly brought back an extra little fatty. To be accurate, he is actually a big fatty, but since he is still young, he could only be called little fatty. </span></p>
  <p><span style>After they exited the southern mountain range, the day already turned dark, so they made their tent near a foot of the mountain. “Come, little fatty, let me test how much strength you have.” Qing Shui said to the little fatty. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“How are you going to test it?” Little fatty looked at his hands and asked doubtfully.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Just hit me as hard as you can.” Qing Shui said with a smile. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Little fatty shook his head, “No, I’m scared that I might injure you!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hahaha, how can you injure big brother Shui? Big brother Shui can knock you down with one hand!” Qing Bei giggled next to them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you really want me to hit you?” Little fatty asked again to confirm!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t worry, use all your strength. You won’t be able to harm me!” Qing Shui waved his hand, indicating little fatty to attack him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Little fatty stopped declining and stepped forward to deliver a dash punch. Qing Shui knew this was the genuine skill of the Zhuang clan. However, since little fatty had inborn divine strength, this punch had the vitality of a tiger. It was also quick and violent!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, not bad. The speed and strength are good, but you are similar to an unpolished jade right now.” Qing Shui casually stopped little fatty’s fist. He felt that the strength was a little more than 5,000 jin. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Being blocked, the little fatty retracted his fist quickly and combined it with his other fist. He squatted and tried to hit Qing Shui again. When Qing Shui saw this, he felt an air of aggressiveness and an imposing manner about the little fatty. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Unfortunately, his true strength now was no match for how he had been before, and Qing Shui casually stopped little fatty’s two fists. Little fatty retracted his hands and stopped attacking. “Big brother Shui, I won’t try to hit you anymore. This is just too depressing.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Starting from yesterday until today, little fatty followed Qing Hu’s example and started calling him big brother Shui. Qing Shui didn’t mind, since it was always a good thing when someone called him big brother. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Little fatty, let’s play!” Qing Hu suggested restlessly!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Little fatty looked at Qing Shui, and Qing Shui nodded.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Only after Qing Shui nodded, did little fatty agree to Qing Hu’s suggestion. This made Qing Shui feel that although little fatty was young, he was very cautious!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Hu ate two “Energy-Enhancing Fruits,” which gave him 1,000 jin of strength. Although his strength was barely 4,000 jin, his biggest strength was that he had the help of skills and techniques. </span></p>
  <p><span style>This fight was also inconceivable to Qing Shui. Just by strength and reflex, little fatty was evenly matched with Qing Hu. This really exemplified the power of raw strength. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Although this trip was rewarding, Qing Shui did not discover any herbs of interest from the trade, which left a little regret. </span></p>
  <p><span style>After half a month, Qing Shui and company returned to Hundred Miles City safely!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Almost twenty people lived at the Qing clan’s medical store already. What surprised Qing Shui most was that his gorgeous fourth aunt made a clothing store that had been in business for half a month in Hundred Miles City. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Hu, Qing Hai, Yuan Ying, and Qing Yi have always been the ones to take care of the Qing clan’s medical store. Cultivation were the primary concerns for Qing Jiang and Qing He, so they usually did not take care of Qing clan’s businesses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Qing You just returned from outside and saw Qing Shui, he happily ran towards him. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at Qing You, whom he hasn’t seen in half a year. He seemed to have gotten more robust. “If I had known you guys were going out to play earlier, I would’ve came earlier. I was bored sitting here for almost a month.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shui left, Qing Zi and Qing You were still at the Qing clan village and weren’t able to make it here in time. </span></p>
  <p><span style>-</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Big brother Shui, grandfather made me ask you where my big brother should get married. In Hundred Miles City or the Qing Family Village!” Qing You chuckled!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Grandfather is asking me?” Qing Shui asked, amazed. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yah, grandfather said that you will arrange this matter. The marriage is set to be the eighth of next month!” Qing You looked at Qing Shui’s slightly perplexed expression but spoke happily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let me arrange this matter? I’m still a bachelor.” Qing Shui gloomily whispered. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, I already delivered the words. Grandfather said you can just arrange it as you like! Also, don’t decline the old man. You will finish this matter, and you will also have to nurture the Qing clan’s next three generations!” Qing You finished talking and laughed lightly. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“There’s still about a month left. Would big brother Zi like it to be in the Qing family village or in Hundred Miles City?” Qing Shui silently thought about how much funding he had on hand and asked Qing You.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course my big brother wants to have it in Hundred Mile City. However, even if we all want to have it in Hundred Miles City, it is difficult to arrange for a marriage in the bridal chamber of Hundred Miles City.” Qing You said bluntly. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s good that you all like it in Hundred Miles City. Just rest for a few days, and we will take care of big brother Zi’s marriage.” Qing Shui pat Qing You’s shoulder after he finished speaking. Although he only used a little strength, he almost made Qing You collapse. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Hu dragged the little fatty around to find a room for him to live. Qing Shui walked towards the drawing room of the Qing clan’s medical store. The two generations of the Qing clan usually stayed there. </span></p>
  <p><span style>He pushed open the door of the drawing room. After Qing Shui entered, he found that the two generations who had come to Hundred Miles City were all there. Qing Shui rubbed his head and greeted everyone. Then he made certain that Qing Zi’s marriage was actually really his responsibility, and it made Qing Shui a little gloomy. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, you are the hope of our Qing clan. You have to really train that group of little brats in the future.” Qing Hai chuckled. He had been training them earlier. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Fourth Uncle, don’t praise me anymore. The higher the hope the bigger the disappointment. I won’t be stingy with skills that I know and they can learn, but as for training, it is better if fourth uncle supervises them. They are really scared of you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words provoked a wave of good-natured laughter!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I want to open a clinic at the Qing clan’s medical store!” Qing Shui spoke slowly after seeing that no one was talking anymore. Qing Shui discovered through experience that his medical expertise had made great progress, so Qing Shui was thinking about opening a clinic specifically for the treatment of hard-to-treat medical conditions. Not only could he improve upon his medical skills, but he could also earn some extra money. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Your grandfather said that you can just do whatever you want to do. You don’t need to talk to anyone, so just do it if you want to. Everyone in the Qing clan will support you.” Qing Hai sipped his tea and said leisurely. </span></p>
  <p><span style>These simple words made Qing Shui feel warmth in his heart. Qing Shui knew that ever since he had cured Yu Donghao, killed Bai Zhong, and healed Baili Jingwei, he had already been elevated to a special status in his Qing clan. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“It is better this way. It will save me a lot of trouble in the future.” After he walked out of the Qing clan’s store, Qing Shui walked towards the Yu He Inn. It had been a month. Although he left Yu He a month’s worth of black fish, in this month he knew from Qing Hu’s mouth that Yu He had tried to find him four times, Wenren Wu-Shuang two times, and Qing Lang one time. Now that he was back, he should go visit them. </span></p>
  <p><span style>As a person’s strength increases, so would his presence, his heart, and even his frivolity. However, the biggest feeling that Qing Shui had was the improvement in his strength. His attitude also changed for the better. Everything now seemed to be easy to resolve. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stepped into Yu He Inn and found that the business was still prosperous as always. A beautiful waitress smiled sweetly after she saw Qing Shui, and used her cute hand to point upstairs, meaning that “Yu He is upstairs!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled at the girl and walked upstairs. He felt strange, as if he were meeting his girlfriend from his previous life. </span></p>
  <p><span style>When Yu He saw Qing Shui, her unconcealable happiness made Qing Shui very joyful. “When did you return!” Yu He asked cheerfully.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I just arrived home at noon and came to see your majesty Yu He at once.” Qing Shui looked at the still graceful, elegant, and dignified Yu He and felt a wave of comfort in his heart. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you miss me this much?” Yu He let Qing Shui into the room and laughed. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course, not seeing you for one day seems like three years. I couldn’t imagine that this one trip would feel like thirty years. I missed you so much day and night that I couldn’t sleep. My head was filled with your majesty Yu He’s image. I came to see you as soon as I returned. I haven’t even sat down yet.” Qing Shui’s mood was great right now because to chat with beautiful women is one of most wonderful things he can do with his time. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“You’re so talkative. All you know is how to say sweet nothings; tell me how many girls did you deceive on this trip.” Yu He was rarely this happy, and chatted away with him as if she was her intimate friend. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“What deceiving are you talking about! A man as noble, handsome, and elegant as me was welcomed by many beautiful women along the way. I would have to visit tens of ladies’ chambers at night. Such hardship!” Qing Shui said with an expression of great bitterness. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“You lowly kid, keep bragging. What each night visiting tens of ladies’ chambers. You would dry out by now!” Yu He laughed. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I am an unrivalled miracle. Sleeping with hundreds of women in one night is as easy as turning my palm. Everyone who tried it with me are all satisfied! Do you want to…” Qing Shui slowly advanced his words. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ok, don’t speak anymore!” Yu He said angrily at Qing Shui but glanced at him charmingly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I haven’t seen you in a month; I also miss you so much. Whatever you say, you have to compensate me in some way!” One can only hint, and not say anything directly when teasing a gorgeous woman’s feelings. The most wonderful feeling about it is the spiritual shock. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He quietly looked at Qing Shui. Her deep and beautiful eyes became a little embarrassed as she looked at Qing Shui. Just when Qing Shui wanted to escape, Yu He hugged Qing Shui’s neck and softly printed her sexy and gentle lips on his face. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Before Qing Shui was able to awake from his astonishment, Yu He’s charming face blushed and retreated shyly. “Ok, I compensated you. Are you satisfied now?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As he heard her shy and magnetic voice, and saw her exceptionally beautiful face, her alluring and sexy body, and gazed upon her plump and fine buttocks, Qing Shui couldn’t help but remember how it felt against him. Soft, sweet, elastic, and an inexplicable feeling of temptation in his heart. </span></p>
  <p><span style>He thought about her breasts, her lips and her beautiful buttocks again. They have all been tainted by himself. He lifted his head and saw Yu He looking at him and rebuking him. Qing Shui gave a simple smile in return. Unfortunately, Qing Shui’s delicate feature, his beautiful eyes, plus that light purple mark between his eyebrows made Qing Shui’s simple smile a little bewitching. It even had some magnificence that only belonged to men. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m satisfied! Of course I’m satisfied!” Qing Shui was just joking at first, so he didn’t think that Yu He would kiss him on her own. He felt pleasantly surprised, but also a little unrest in his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If it was Qing Shui in the past, he would even shamelessly take more advantage of her, but now all his thoughts were placed on Shi Qingzhuang. He felt that it would be difficult to have any result with Yu He in the future, so he just wanted to be friends, best friends. [1]</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Big sister Yu, I got some turtles again; are you interested?” Qing Shui diverted the topic. He was scared that he wouldn’t be able to control what might happen between Yu He and himself. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you saying that they are of the same quality as the black fish?” Yu He’s said as her beautiful eyes sparkled with extraordinary splendor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, I brought two at the door. You should cook them in the kitchen to try their flavor.” Qing Shui said as he led her towards the door. </span></p>

 <p><strong>AST 0120 - Yu He’s Charm </strong></p>
 <p><span style>That man pressed into the beautiful young wife under his body. His arms hooked under the woman’s long pair of jade smooth legs to support himself, and to lift her ass up as much as possible. The man’s thick and solid manhood rammed in and pulled out substantially, and he made the woman moan every time he pushed in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when he finished saying that he’d go satisfy himself with the beautiful young widow who was trading herbs after he finished satisfying this horny bitch, and just when his rod which was going in and out, he didn’t have time to thrust in after moving out, because the man felt a strong wave of pain below him. When he looked down, he was so scared that he fainted. This was because a stone had smashed his manhood into meat pulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui left expressionlessly. “This foul-mouthed man. I had intended to kill him at first, but it would probably be better to make life a living hell for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Qing Shui left, when the man fainted, his loud cry made the woman who was still engrossed in ecstasy look down at the tragedy below, and then she let out a scream. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the quiet night, that cry traveled far and wide. Quickly, many people holding torches gathered tens of people and hurriedly ascended the mountain. They might have thought that wild beasts might have climbed up the mountain, so each group hurried up the mountain with their weapons. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived they saw the devastation on the lower body of the doctor who lost his consciousness, his naked body, and the beautiful young wife whose clothes were in disorder. The previous rumors about their relationship made everyone certain that those two were engaging in shady business. The only question they had now was how the man had lost his most important body part. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You f**king skank, get your ass back here!” Another strong man pulled the beautiful young wife up and dragged her back. Unfortunately, Qing Shui was unable to witness this scene. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day, everything went back to normal, but there were a few whispers about someone losing his balls. Qing Shui knew they were talking about that foul-mouthed doctor. There were a few discussions about some vixen having an extramarital affair as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The most popular topic was who had crushed the doctor’s balls. Some people suspected it was the beautiful young wife, while others suspected it was the work of the beautiful young wife’s husband. These hypotheses made Qing Shui want to laugh. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Near afternoon, they were nearly done with their herb trade, filling up a carriage completely. With the help of little fatty, they were able to travel with ease. This was because he knew which kinds of herbs each house had, thereby increasing their efficiency. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They quickly finished preparing everything. When they decided to leave, that muscular doctor, supported by a middle-aged woman, arrived in front of Qing Shui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Divine Doctor, I know your medical skills are divine, so you have to help me!” That doctor already regarded Qing Shui as a Xiantian alchemist, and thought that he could refine pellets that could regenerate body parts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, what happened to you? Where do you feel uncomfortable?” Qing Shui looked at the clumsy and solid man doubtfully. He gazed all around the man’s body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry; I am powerless. That thing is already thoroughly destroyed!” Qing Shui shook his head, and spoke with pity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people started to discuss quietly amongst themselves about how the man used to require other women to go to bed with him as a payment for saving people. Soon the man felt so ashamed that he abandoned his thoughts of begging Qing Shui again, and slipped away in a panic. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“As a doctor, you didn’t conduct yourself with dignity. I don’t really care whether you were having affairs, but I couldn’t forgive your bad mouthing, and taking advantage of others at their weakest!” Qing Shui didn’t feel that he had done anything wrong at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they returned, they had little fatty as an extra member. That old man told Qing Shui and Qing Yi many good words about him and then warned the little fatty, “You have to listen to their orders and not create any trouble for them. Keep living, and don’t disappoint your brother’s expectations for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know Grandfather Wu. Thank you and the other grandfathers for your aid all these years!” Little Fatty said gratefully. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way back, Qing Shui felt that this trip had really been worth it. He must say that it had the highest worth. They unexpectedly brought back an extra little fatty. To be accurate, he is actually a big fatty, but since he is still young, he could only be called little fatty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After they exited the southern mountain range, the day already turned dark, so they made their tent near a foot of the mountain. “Come, little fatty, let me test how much strength you have.” Qing Shui said to the little fatty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you going to test it?” Little fatty looked at his hands and asked doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just hit me as hard as you can.” Qing Shui said with a smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Little fatty shook his head, “No, I’m scared that I might injure you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, how can you injure big brother Shui? Big brother Shui can knock you down with one hand!” Qing Bei giggled next to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really want me to hit you?” Little fatty asked again to confirm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, use all your strength. You won’t be able to harm me!” Qing Shui waved his hand, indicating little fatty to attack him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little fatty stopped declining and stepped forward to deliver a dash punch. Qing Shui knew this was the genuine skill of the Zhuang clan. However, since little fatty had inborn divine strength, this punch had the vitality of a tiger. It was also quick and violent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, not bad. The speed and strength are good, but you are similar to an unpolished jade right now.” Qing Shui casually stopped little fatty’s fist. He felt that the strength was a little more than 5,000 jin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Being blocked, the little fatty retracted his fist quickly and combined it with his other fist. He squatted and tried to hit Qing Shui again. When Qing Shui saw this, he felt an air of aggressiveness and an imposing manner about the little fatty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, his true strength now was no match for how he had been before, and Qing Shui casually stopped little fatty’s two fists. Little fatty retracted his hands and stopped attacking. “Big brother Shui, I won’t try to hit you anymore. This is just too depressing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Starting from yesterday until today, little fatty followed Qing Hu’s example and started calling him big brother Shui. Qing Shui didn’t mind, since it was always a good thing when someone called him big brother. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fatty, let’s play!” Qing Hu suggested restlessly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little fatty looked at Qing Shui, and Qing Shui nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after Qing Shui nodded, did little fatty agree to Qing Hu’s suggestion. This made Qing Shui feel that although little fatty was young, he was very cautious!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Hu ate two “Energy-Enhancing Fruits,” which gave him 1,000 jin of strength. Although his strength was barely 4,000 jin, his biggest strength was that he had the help of skills and techniques. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This fight was also inconceivable to Qing Shui. Just by strength and reflex, little fatty was evenly matched with Qing Hu. This really exemplified the power of raw strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this trip was rewarding, Qing Shui did not discover any herbs of interest from the trade, which left a little regret. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After half a month, Qing Shui and company returned to Hundred Miles City safely!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost twenty people lived at the Qing clan’s medical store already. What surprised Qing Shui most was that his gorgeous fourth aunt made a clothing store that had been in business for half a month in Hundred Miles City. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Hu, Qing Hai, Yuan Ying, and Qing Yi have always been the ones to take care of the Qing clan’s medical store. Cultivation were the primary concerns for Qing Jiang and Qing He, so they usually did not take care of Qing clan’s businesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Qing You just returned from outside and saw Qing Shui, he happily ran towards him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at Qing You, whom he hasn’t seen in half a year. He seemed to have gotten more robust. “If I had known you guys were going out to play earlier, I would’ve came earlier. I was bored sitting here for almost a month.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Shui left, Qing Zi and Qing You were still at the Qing clan village and weren’t able to make it here in time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother Shui, grandfather made me ask you where my big brother should get married. In Hundred Miles City or the Qing Family Village!” Qing You chuckled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather is asking me?” Qing Shui asked, amazed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yah, grandfather said that you will arrange this matter. The marriage is set to be the eighth of next month!” Qing You looked at Qing Shui’s slightly perplexed expression but spoke happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me arrange this matter? I’m still a bachelor.” Qing Shui gloomily whispered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I already delivered the words. Grandfather said you can just arrange it as you like! Also, don’t decline the old man. You will finish this matter, and you will also have to nurture the Qing clan’s next three generations!” Qing You finished talking and laughed lightly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s still about a month left. Would big brother Zi like it to be in the Qing family village or in Hundred Miles City?” Qing Shui silently thought about how much funding he had on hand and asked Qing You.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course my big brother wants to have it in Hundred Mile City. However, even if we all want to have it in Hundred Miles City, it is difficult to arrange for a marriage in the bridal chamber of Hundred Miles City.” Qing You said bluntly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that you all like it in Hundred Miles City. Just rest for a few days, and we will take care of big brother Zi’s marriage.” Qing Shui pat Qing You’s shoulder after he finished speaking. Although he only used a little strength, he almost made Qing You collapse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Hu dragged the little fatty around to find a room for him to live. Qing Shui walked towards the drawing room of the Qing clan’s medical store. The two generations of the Qing clan usually stayed there. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He pushed open the door of the drawing room. After Qing Shui entered, he found that the two generations who had come to Hundred Miles City were all there. Qing Shui rubbed his head and greeted everyone. Then he made certain that Qing Zi’s marriage was actually really his responsibility, and it made Qing Shui a little gloomy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, you are the hope of our Qing clan. You have to really train that group of little brats in the future.” Qing Hai chuckled. He had been training them earlier. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth Uncle, don’t praise me anymore. The higher the hope the bigger the disappointment. I won’t be stingy with skills that I know and they can learn, but as for training, it is better if fourth uncle supervises them. They are really scared of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words provoked a wave of good-natured laughter!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to open a clinic at the Qing clan’s medical store!” Qing Shui spoke slowly after seeing that no one was talking anymore. Qing Shui discovered through experience that his medical expertise had made great progress, so Qing Shui was thinking about opening a clinic specifically for the treatment of hard-to-treat medical conditions. Not only could he improve upon his medical skills, but he could also earn some extra money. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your grandfather said that you can just do whatever you want to do. You don’t need to talk to anyone, so just do it if you want to. Everyone in the Qing clan will support you.” Qing Hai sipped his tea and said leisurely. </span></p>
 <p><span style>These simple words made Qing Shui feel warmth in his heart. Qing Shui knew that ever since he had cured Yu Donghao, killed Bai Zhong, and healed Baili Jingwei, he had already been elevated to a special status in his Qing clan. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is better this way. It will save me a lot of trouble in the future.” After he walked out of the Qing clan’s store, Qing Shui walked towards the Yu He Inn. It had been a month. Although he left Yu He a month’s worth of black fish, in this month he knew from Qing Hu’s mouth that Yu He had tried to find him four times, Wenren Wu-Shuang two times, and Qing Lang one time. Now that he was back, he should go visit them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As a person’s strength increases, so would his presence, his heart, and even his frivolity. However, the biggest feeling that Qing Shui had was the improvement in his strength. His attitude also changed for the better. Everything now seemed to be easy to resolve. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui stepped into Yu He Inn and found that the business was still prosperous as always. A beautiful waitress smiled sweetly after she saw Qing Shui, and used her cute hand to point upstairs, meaning that “Yu He is upstairs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled at the girl and walked upstairs. He felt strange, as if he were meeting his girlfriend from his previous life. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Yu He saw Qing Shui, her unconcealable happiness made Qing Shui very joyful. “When did you return!” Yu He asked cheerfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just arrived home at noon and came to see your majesty Yu He at once.” Qing Shui looked at the still graceful, elegant, and dignified Yu He and felt a wave of comfort in his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you miss me this much?” Yu He let Qing Shui into the room and laughed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, not seeing you for one day seems like three years. I couldn’t imagine that this one trip would feel like thirty years. I missed you so much day and night that I couldn’t sleep. My head was filled with your majesty Yu He’s image. I came to see you as soon as I returned. I haven’t even sat down yet.” Qing Shui’s mood was great right now because to chat with beautiful women is one of most wonderful things he can do with his time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so talkative. All you know is how to say sweet nothings; tell me how many girls did you deceive on this trip.” Yu He was rarely this happy, and chatted away with him as if she was her intimate friend. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What deceiving are you talking about! A man as noble, handsome, and elegant as me was welcomed by many beautiful women along the way. I would have to visit tens of ladies’ chambers at night. Such hardship!” Qing Shui said with an expression of great bitterness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You lowly kid, keep bragging. What each night visiting tens of ladies’ chambers. You would dry out by now!” Yu He laughed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am an unrivalled miracle. Sleeping with hundreds of women in one night is as easy as turning my palm. Everyone who tried it with me are all satisfied! Do you want to…” Qing Shui slowly advanced his words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok, don’t speak anymore!” Yu He said angrily at Qing Shui but glanced at him charmingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t seen you in a month; I also miss you so much. Whatever you say, you have to compensate me in some way!” One can only hint, and not say anything directly when teasing a gorgeous woman’s feelings. The most wonderful feeling about it is the spiritual shock. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He quietly looked at Qing Shui. Her deep and beautiful eyes became a little embarrassed as she looked at Qing Shui. Just when Qing Shui wanted to escape, Yu He hugged Qing Shui’s neck and softly printed her sexy and gentle lips on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Qing Shui was able to awake from his astonishment, Yu He’s charming face blushed and retreated shyly. “Ok, I compensated you. Are you satisfied now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he heard her shy and magnetic voice, and saw her exceptionally beautiful face, her alluring and sexy body, and gazed upon her plump and fine buttocks, Qing Shui couldn’t help but remember how it felt against him. Soft, sweet, elastic, and an inexplicable feeling of temptation in his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought about her breasts, her lips and her beautiful buttocks again. They have all been tainted by himself. He lifted his head and saw Yu He looking at him and rebuking him. Qing Shui gave a simple smile in return. Unfortunately, Qing Shui’s delicate feature, his beautiful eyes, plus that light purple mark between his eyebrows made Qing Shui’s simple smile a little bewitching. It even had some magnificence that only belonged to men. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m satisfied! Of course I’m satisfied!” Qing Shui was just joking at first, so he didn’t think that Yu He would kiss him on her own. He felt pleasantly surprised, but also a little unrest in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was Qing Shui in the past, he would even shamelessly take more advantage of her, but now all his thoughts were placed on Shi Qingzhuang. He felt that it would be difficult to have any result with Yu He in the future, so he just wanted to be friends, best friends. [1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big sister Yu, I got some turtles again; are you interested?” Qing Shui diverted the topic. He was scared that he wouldn’t be able to control what might happen between Yu He and himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying that they are of the same quality as the black fish?” Yu He’s said as her beautiful eyes sparkled with extraordinary splendor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, I brought two at the door. You should cook them in the kitchen to try their flavor.” Qing Shui said as he led her towards the door. </span></p>
