 <p><strong>AST 1345 - Meeting the Demon Lord Once Again, She Was A False God Cultivator? Physical Strength of 12 sun</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Nine Continents Mountain had reached Grade Three and it would attack its target with three times that of his physical strength and three times his speed. This was pure power. Therefore, Qing Shui's attacks with the Nine Continents Mountain had reached close to 150,000 sun.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>However, the attacks of the Nine Continents Mountain weren't as simple as just having a strength of 150,000 sun. It was because it also moved with three times his speed. Qing Shui's speed was already considered to be very terrifying. Furthermore, he had gotten an explosive increase in his powers and thus his speed had increased by a lot as well. With the Nine Continents Mountain's attacks reaching 150,000 sun, under that terrifying speed, the impact would far surpass 150,000 sun. It wouldn't even lose out to spirit energy attacks in any way. Moreover, there was still the terrifying shield attack which, with the increase in the grade, the power of the shield attack was also greater.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Nine Continents Mountain had leveled up and Qing Shui was extremely happy. If he were to fight against a Peak Martial Emperor now, the Nine Continents Mountain should be able to fend off various kinds of attacks as if they were child's play. Moreover, Qing Shui could still weaken his opponents. One Nine Continents Mountain alone would be able to sink the opponent into depression. Through heart follows intent, he would be able to control the Nine Continents Mountain with his mind, unleashing its prowess to the limit.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Before Old Man Puyang had left, he had brought up something with Qing Shui. He wanted to see if Qing Shui could help to extend the lifespan of an old person in Puyang Clan.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>This old person had a terrifying cultivation level.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>False God cultivator!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>To think that Puyang Clan also had False God cultivators. This False God's lifespan was coming to an end and hadn't interfered with the world's happenings for many years. The older generations from the Yehuang City's great clans all knew of this person's existence. Although the person wasn't concerned with worldly affairs, no one would dare to neglect her existence.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>This old lady was Puyang Clan's Old Ancestor.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Other than Old Man Puyang and the lass, no one else in the Puyang had met this old lady before. They had only heard that there was a powerful existence in the clan.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui naturally agreed. Moreover, he wanted to take a look at how powerful a False God was.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>For the past few days, Qing Shui would take one Three-Yang Pill daily. There was a limit to the number of the pills one could take. Under the effect of the Double Portion Medication, Qing Shui could take double the portion of the Three-Yang Pills.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Although the increment to his strength was no longer significant to Qing Shui, what he viewed as the most important, was to strengthen his constitution and to stabilize and reinforce his Nine Yang Physique. This would allow the power in his body to be even more pure and condensed, thus stabilizing the state of his achieved realm.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Realm was something very important. It was something which couldn't be built up through medicinal pills.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui didn't try the Four-Yang Pills. He was waiting, waiting for the medicinal effect of the medicinal herbs to increase, as well as waiting for the Treasure Hunting Pig and the Jade Emperor Queen Bee to attain a breakthrough. Qing Shui was also full of anticipation for the Four-Yang Pill. He wanted to see the difference between the Three-Yang Pills and the Four-Yang Pills. How great could the demarcation between the two be?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Just as Qing Shui was thinking about this, there was a familiar ripple. Without any hesitation, Qing Shui immediately left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Then, with a flash, he dashed up into the sky at an unbelievable speed.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui was very agitated. It was because it wasn't easy to be able to encounter that familiar aura here. The last time they had met, it was a few years ago. Very soon, Qing Shui saw it.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>There was a huge old turtle. Right now, the old turtle wasn't any smaller compared to that huge green dragon he had met in his consciousness. It was just that one of them was very, very long, while the old turtle was an immense and gigantic creature.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui also saw that cold and arrogant lady.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Demon Lord!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lady's hair was put up, her brows soft and her face, which was clear of any signs of makeup, appeared to have the color of the morning sun reflecting on the snow. Her beauty was divine and she had a pair of beautiful eyes that seemed to have the cold of winter.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>That pair of cold and piercing eyes were beautiful like snow and appeared to be pure but yet were so cold that it felt as if the cold would penetrate down to one's bones.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>She had a beautiful figure and her snow-white plain clothes couldn't hide her curves. Her shoulders were sharp like blades and the arch before her chest was breathtaking. Her waist seemed to be smooth as silk and her slender figure was beautiful like a great jade carving masterpiece. Her pair of bare beautiful feet exuded a translucent glow...</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Standing there, she exuded an aura which made one feel that she mustn't be tainted. Amongst all the ladies Qing Shui had came across, she was one who was the hardest to get close to. It wasn't due to the fact that she was cold but rather, it was an air of arrogance that came out from her soul.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lady was still as cool as before. Her pair of beautiful eyes were still so cold that it would penetrate into one's bones. However, she was extremely beautiful, like snow, pure yet with a chill that would enter one's ones. Her coldness was very natural, as if it was something she was born with.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>When the lady saw Qing Shui, she was also stunned. This was the first time that Qing Shui had seen a ripple in those beautiful, cold eyes. However, it was the tiniest hint of a ripple, which then disappeared completely.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>She looked at Qing Shui, silent. Earlier, she had also sensed Qing Shui's aura. And when Qing Shui arrived, she seemed as if she was here waiting for him.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>When Qing Shui saw this lady, he was still very astonished. It was because even though he had become many times stronger than before, he still couldn't sense her cultivation level. She was still that unfathomable.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>He could clearly sense that she was a lot more powerful than Old Man Puyang.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>False God?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>To think that she was a False God existence. Although Qing Shui had made a daring guess previously, he was still very shocked to find out about it. He didn't know if back then, she had concealed her abilities or was it because she had just been released from the seal. She was now worlds apart when compared to her strength from back then. Or maybe, it could be because he was too weak back then.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>When Qing Shui saw this lady, he couldn't help but feel a sense of defeat. It was so funny how when he was back in the five continents, he had thought that he could at least stand on the same ground as her when they met again. The ignorant were truly fearless.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Back then, it was a miracle for her to not have killed him. After all, before her, he was insignificant and weak as an ant. To be violated by an ant, would be like a person having his finger bitten off by an ant. The person would probably have squashed the ant on the spot. This was just an analogy. Back then, regardless how Qing Shui had been out of options, he had ended up having a physical relationship with her. This feeling was not much better than having an ant biting off your finger.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Therefore, it was already considered a miracle that Qing Shui was still alive, that she hadn't killed him.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Back then, this lady was also astonished, very astonished. Each time she met him, he had improved by a terrifying rate.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Hello, I sensed that you were passing by, so I came to take a look..." Qing Shui would always appear to be uneasy before her. It was out of guilt and a feeling of inferiority, as well as a strange feeling of wanting to help her. It was a pity that he still didn't have the right to do so, nor did he know if he would ever gain the right to help her.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>He felt that he would but he just needed time. It was a pity that it was too hard to get a lady like her to fall in love with him. Who knew if this lady had any feelings, emotions or desires? Compared to Yiye Jiange, she was an even more troublesome existence.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"What do you have to say? I should be leaving."</strong></p>
 <p><strong>This was what the lady said. Thankfully, she didn't leave immediately like she did the other time. Previously, she had just left.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>When Qing Shui heard what she said, he took two steps forward, "I want to help you. I don't know if you can use the medicinal pills that I have. And I know acupuncture. I should be able to help you increase your powers."</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui had heard about her. She seemed to be up against many enemies and many people wanted to get rid of her. Right now, he was strong enough to help her, so he wanted to give it a go since they had met again. However, he knew that the possibility was very low.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lady shook her head slightly, not saying anything.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"I only want to help you!" Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Do you know how many people are after my life? If you don't wish to die, don't get too close with me and don't mention me at all." The lady's cold voice was very pleasant to the years but there was a strong tone of rejection in her voice.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"I don't know how many people are trying to kill you but I wish to help you. Even if you're up against the entire nine continents, I also wish to help you. It's a pity that I'm not strong enough to help you now. If I gain enough power to help you one day, I'll definitely go and look for you. Can you give me a chance and let me help you a little now?" Qing Shui said very slowly.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lady didn't show any changes to her expression but just cast her cold gaze upon Qing Shui, "Why? Just treat it as a dream and forget about it!"</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"I can't. If I could, I wouldn't have been thinking about looking for you. However, each time I meet you, I realize that there's a huge gap between us. I'd also heard of your plight, therefore, I won't say anything. I really want to help you. I won't harbor any other thoughts. Please," Qing Shui asked, with great anticipation.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui knew that it was very hard even to become friends with this lady. Therefore, he only hoped to be able to talk to her for a bit longer. He hadn't spoken much with the lady since the first time they had met.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Maybe next time. I should leave," The lady said softly and was about to turn to leave.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"Then take this. I hope that it can be of some help to you." With that, Qing Shui tossed out an interspatial silk sachet.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lady reached out her hand and grabbed it.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>"I'm leaving!" When the lady's voice reached him, she had already disappeared with that divine turtle.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui stood in midair, feeling melancholy as he looked in the direction the lady disappeared in. He was already very astonished to find out that she would catch the interspatial silk sachet. There were many things inside, including medicinal pills, wine, spices and even some Jade Steamed Buns and other food...</strong></p>
 <p><strong>In the most conspicuous spot, there was a beast parchment which had recorded the different benefits of the different items clearly. There were also several Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellets, Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets and other medicinal pills.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>This was already considered a great improvement and he should be feeling happy. Qing Shui didn't know how long he had stood in the air before he returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. He secretly told himself that the next time they met, he must reach Peak Martial Emperor, one who had reached a strength of at least 500,000 sun.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The moment he returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He wanted to refine the powers he had gotten from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant during this period of time. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's physical strength had increased from nine sun to the current 15 sun. There had been an increment of six sun. Therefore, Qing Shui's physical strength could also increase by over one sun. Although it wasn't a lot, it wasn't considered little.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Now that he had become more powerful, it was easier to refine the additional power. Furthermore, his own cultivation was also improving and his physical strength had reached 12 sun.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>His strength had reached close to 60,000 sun and when the prowess of his attacks doubled, it would be close to 120,000 sun. And the Nine Continents Mountain would reach an attacking power of close to 170,000 sun.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>In comparison, Qing Shui's spirit energy was stronger. If he were to use the Seal of Roc, he could reach a strength of close to 160,000 sun and when the power was doubled, it could reach a terrifying 320,000 sun.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>He had surpassed the lowest level amongst Peak Martial Emperors.</strong></p>
