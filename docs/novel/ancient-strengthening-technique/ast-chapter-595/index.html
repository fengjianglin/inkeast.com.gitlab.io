 <p><strong>595 - Fifth stage of the Heavenly Dan, communication between Dantians, Explosive increase in strength</strong></p>
 <p>After the time it took for an incense to burn, the two elders opened their eyes and looked at Qing Shui with shock. They had not taken this kind of medicinal pills to increase their strength for a long time because they were resistant to medicinal pills. There were very few King Grade medicinal pills that could help them increase their strength. Furthermore, these pills would only increase their strength by one country, proving that this was only a Grade One King Grade Medicinal Pill.</p>
 <p>Grade One and Two King Grade Medicinal Pills could increase a Martial Saint's strength by a maximum of one country. Grade Three and Four King Grade Medicinal Pills could increase a Martial Saint's strength by a maximum of two countries……</p>
 <p>Grade Nine and Ten King Grade Medicinal Pills could increase a Martial Saint's strength by a maximum of five countries!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly gave them a portion of the other medicinal pills. Since they had already become one family, Qing Shui would not be stingy. Furthermore, them growing stronger was in the interest of Qing Shui, only when the Qing Clan had a solid strength could Qing Shui leave without any worries.</p>
 <p>Inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Currently, his progress has slowed down but the Ancient Strengthening Technique had broken through to the 240th cycle. His body’s strength has reached 125 countries and his body's defense had reached 155 countries.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was about to stop, he suddenly felt the Heavenly Dan near his Zhongfu acupoint circulate rapidly. Furthermore, it was releasing an eye-catching golden light.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly felt excited. However, he did not know where this excitement came from. The Heavenly Dan that had not broken through in a long time looked like it was about to break through now.</p>
 <p>Just an increase in level would bring him an increase of 100 thousand jins of strength. Qing Shui did not know where this excitement came from, perhaps it could be because the Heavenly Dan had not broken through in a long time.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>In an instant, the Heavenly Dan near his Zhongfu acupoint grew larger by a third. Qing Shui could feel his strength increase by about100 thousand jins. After his joy, there was some disappointment. After all, to the current Qing Shui, 100 thousand jins of strength was only a pitiful increase.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was just about to stop again. However, at this moment, he felt that the Heavenly Dan released another round of golden light. It seemed even more lustrous than before. Meanwhile, the golden liquid in his Dantian gave off a piercing glow.</p>
 <p>The following events cause Qing Shui to open his eyes wide and gasped in shock. The upper Dantian and the lower Dantian gave off a round of golden light then they connected to each other. At that moment, Qing Shui felt an explosive strength fill his body. It seemed that his whole body was undergoing a great change.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was elated, at first he thought that it would be very difficult to raise his strength significantly in such a short time. Unexpectedly, he had gained a rapid increase in strength. There was nothing else that could make Qing Shui happier than this.</p>
 <p>He felt a surging strength fill his body. Now, his bodily strength reached 185 countries and his defense reached 300 countries……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. For a period of time, he was pleasantly surprised but he did not know what was going on. After thinking for a long time, he realized what had happened.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Dan!</p>
 <p>After the Heavenly Dan rose to the fifth level, not only did it added 100 thousand jins of strength, it even permanently increased the body’s strength by 50% and the body’s defense by 100%.</p>
 <p>It was ridiculously strong increase!</p>
 <p>In the past, Qing Shui felt that this Heavenly Dan should have a great potential, just that after he got stronger it became something of little interest. If he did not have the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would have considered abandoning the cultivation of the Heavenly Dan after awhile.</p>
 <p>With this, Heavenly Dan could be considered to have lived up to its name. Although his abilities did not increase by a fold, he still felt that the tenth level of the Heavenly Day might be able to raise his abilities by a fold. Furthermore, the Heavenly Dan now increased his defense by a fold, causing the strength of Qing Shui’s body to be strengthened to a perverse level.</p>
 <p>Because of the effects of Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection, Qing Shui did not have to circulate any other techniques to raise his body’s strength to 370 countries and his defense to a terrifying 600 countries……</p>
 <p>Nature Energy! Increase in abilities by 30%.</p>
 <p>State of Immovable as Mountains! Increase in abilities by 20%.</p>
 <p>Frenzied Bull's Strength! Increase in abilities by 30%.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Slash! Increase in strength by 30%.</p>
 <p>Shield Attack! Increase in strength by 20%.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>With his bare hands and without any external aid, Qing Shui had the strength of 610 countries and the defense of 840 countries……</p>
 <p>If he accounted for the effects of the Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Big Dipper Sword, as well as the Heavenly Talismans, Qing Shui felt as though he was the mincemeat in a meat pie. An attack with the strength of 962 countries……</p>
 <p>This way, Qing Shui’s abilities allowed him to reach the strength equivalent to a peak Grade Five Martial Saint. Although this was Qing Shui’s peak strength, he still had many other trump cards. Not to mention Critical Damage, the heaven-defying Emperor's Qi would be a nightmare for every Martial Saint. Now, even if he met with another martial saint of the same grade as him, he could reduce the opponent’s grade by one if he used the Emperor's Qi…… if he added on the Art of Pursuing, Binding Talisman, Armor Break Talisman, Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb, and the Demon Binding Ropes…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his future path was broad and smooth, like he was in the seventh heaven. However, Qing Shui knew that this time, regardless of the method, he would not be able to rapidly increase his strength in such a short period of time again. He felt that his strength had reached a state of saturation, just like before he broke through to the Martial Saint Realm.</p>
 <p>Grade 5 Martial Saint was a pitfall on the road of cultivation, this was what Qing Shui saw on ‘Legends of martial cultivation in the Main Continent’. Although rising from Grade Five Martial Saint to Grade Six Martial Saint was not as difficult as breaking through to Martial Saint, it was still a big pitfall within the realm of Martial Saint. It was much more difficult than breaking through from Grade One Martial Saint to Grade Five Martial Saint combined.</p>
 <p>Every increase of 1000 countries was a pitfall, each ability of the body would reach a bottleneck, achieving saturation. However, Qing Shui was filled with hope because of the existence of the Heavenly Dan, it allowed Qing Shui to see that his future path would be very smooth.</p>
 <p>Time went by day by day. Very soon it would be the end of the year, the celebrations of Greencloud Continent City was more lively than the celebrations of the Qing Clan Villa. There were big red lanterns hung on every tree on both sides of the road, they were present on every major street.</p>
 <p>As most people had been busy for the whole year, when it was time for the new year, they would prepare good food, new clothes and give the children some money…...</p>
 <p>There would be a festive air everywhere, every family would be decorated with lanterns and colored banners. Regardless of whether they were rich or poor, every family would be decorated in a festive manner.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, let's go out and take a look. I hear that there is a new street, they specialized in selling snacks, how about we go check it out?” Huoyun Liu-Li said to Qing Shui as she carried Qing Zun.</p>
 <p>“Sure, let's get them to come with us.” Qing Shui’s mood was particularly good today.</p>
 <p>Finally, Qing Shui, Huoyun Liu-Li, Canghai Mingyue, Mingyue Gelou, Wenren Wu-shuang, Qing Bei, Qing You, Qing Hu…… Qing Shui did not expect so many people would gather at such short notice, he felt that it was good.</p>
 <p>“Brother Shui, Qing You has found a girlfriend but he would not show her to us. Will you get him to bring her home for everyone to see?” When they just passed the gate, Qing Bei suddenly remembered and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Qing Bei, do you think brother Qing Shui is nosy like you.” Qing You laughed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Qing You. He was tall and mighty, in the Qing Clan, he was one of the stronger ones. He may look very simple minded but he was actually very sharp.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now suddenly realized that the third generation of the Qing Clan were no longer young, even he was already 28 years old. He had met Luan Luan when she was about 3 years old, now she was about to undergo her coming of age ceremony.</p>
 <p>“Qing You, if you really like her then bring her back for uncle and the rest to see.” Qing Shui laughed and said. After all, he was no longer young, bringing her back could be considered as confirming their relationship.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, actually, she agrees too, just that her family objects to it. Her family wants to marry her to a big clan and not to a nobody like me.” Qing You said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Are you silly, within the Greencloud Continent, is there any clan bigger than ours? When the crucial moment is here, the beauty would be taken away, you will cry yourself to death then.” Qing Shui smiled at Qing You.</p>
 <p>“En, I will listen to brother Qing Shui, after the new years, I will bring her home.” Qing You laughed, looking especially silly……</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing You……”</p>
 <p>After they left for a short distance, a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl came running over. The girl was dressed loosely in a warrior’s uniform. Her facial features were exquisite and her eyes were especially huge. A ponytail gave her an air of youthfulness, this was a small beauty that would not compromise.</p>
 <p>When she saw Qing You, she anxiously shouted, her eyes were full of tears.</p>
 <p>“Chao Yun, don’t panic, what happened?” Qing You felt very anxious in his heart, Chao Yun was the younger sister of his girlfriend. Qing You had told her his address and told her to find him if anything happened. Now that she was here today, then her sister must be in trouble.</p>
 <p>“Elder sister was taken away by Ximen Langyuan.”</p>
 <p>Qing You opened his eyes wide instantly then turned to look at Qing Shui “Brother Qing Shui, you guys go on first, I’ll go take a look.”</p>
 <p>Qing You was very calm when he spoke but Qing Shui knew that he was just enduring it.</p>
 <p>“What are you saying, I’ll go with you!” Qing Shui patted Qing You’s shoulders.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, quickly go accompany Qing You, there is no need to bother about us.” Huoyun Liu-Li quickly said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head and summoned the Fire Bird, Qing You and Chao Yun hurriedly climbed onto Qing Shui’s Fire Bird and flew towards the Ximen Clan. Qing Shui had some understanding about the Ximen Clan.</p>
 <p>Although the Ximen Clan was a first rate clan within the Greencloud Continent, it was not able to be compared to a sect like the Heavenly Palace but they were of equal standing as the other big clans from the other countries of the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>All these happened because the Qing Clan was very low profiled, everyone knew about the existence of the Qing Clan but they did not know these were the people of the Qing Clan, that’s why Qing You’s situation occurred.</p>
 <p>“Chao Yun, how long has Chao Yang had been taken away for?” Qing You asked anxiously.</p>
 <p>“After elder sister was taken onto their carriage, I came over in a hurry. They probably have already arrived home.” Chao Yun frowned anxiously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got the Fire Bird to increase its speed. At the same time, he got Qing You and the small girl to sit down. Qing Shui now did not know how he felt, he originally thought that within the Greencloud Continent, it would be very difficult to get him to take action personally. After all, no one would dare to antagonize the Qing Clan. However, he did not expect that such a thing would happen. If they knew about the relationship between Qing You and that girl and knew that Qing You was from the Qing Clan, the Ximen Clan would not dare to do such a thing……</p>
 <p>The Ximen Clan was located at the edge of Greencloud Continent City, right next to the Xiling Country. The Fire Bird, which was flying at its limits, quickly arrived. It was a good thing that it was not far and the Fire Bird had a very fast speed.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry Qing You, It will be fine.” Qing Shui consoled Qing You.</p>
 <p>“En, with brother Qing Shui here, everything can be solved.” Qing You forced a smile.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>When the Fire Bird neared to the Ximen Clan, it began to let out resounding bird cries. Qing Shui got the Fire Bird to directly stop in the airspace of the Ximen Clan.</p>
 <p>The Ximen Clan was a very wealthy clan, the area that their villa occupied was huge, there was the sight of splendorous and majestic mansions everywhere. The pavilion was very orderly, there were lots of people traveling around……</p>
 <p>“Ximen Langyuan, listen well, if the woman you captured is wronged in any way, then I will completely pull out and destroy the Ximen Clan from its roots.” Qing Shui’s voice was not loud but it clearly transmitted to everyone one’s ears within five kilometers.</p>
 <p>There were plenty of people below, when they saw a huge red bird in the sky and heard the words the man on the Fire Bird said, they panicked.</p>
 <p>“This person thinks he is so great just because he had a big bird, the Ximen Clan should not be provoked.”</p>
 <p>“Young master Ximen has created trouble again, I have said long ago that the Ximen Clan will be destroyed at the hands of this young master.” A woman said to herself.</p>
 <p>“Who are you people, how reckless, this is the Ximen Clan……” A burly man roared at the sky.</p>
 <p>The man was coarse and wild. His eyebrows were bushy and he had triangular eyes, his nose was pointed up and he had a big mouth. Altogether, he was ugly to the soul.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird directly shot a big jet black fireball at that man!</p>
