Just like the law which stated that the Battle God Inheritor must recognize the Demon Lord Inheritors as their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui would still fight against evil beings. But he still knew that some people were exceptions. For example, Tantai Lingyan, and also the Vampiric Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress actually knew that Qing Shui wouldn’t do anything to her. However, she was still very surprised by Qing Shui’s identity. She never thought that he would actually be the Battle God Inheritor. And he wasn’t just some ordinary Battle God Inheritors, he was the Golden Battle God Inheritor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, the full moon period of the little brat has already arrived. Without noticing, Qing Shui has already been here for a month. No one was invited. It’s just Qing Shui and the Vampiric Empress enjoying dinner together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since there were just two people eating, they didn’t really need to prepare much for the dinner. Qing Shui cooked himself. There were only some wine and meat dishes. The Vampiric Empress was carrying her daughter while looking at Qing Shui. She kept him company and would often talk to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was how a family was supposed to feel like. Deep down, she was very happy. It’s a very rare thing to find such an outstanding man to cook for her and also her daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Children fell asleep easily. Before Qing Shui finished preparing dinner, the little brat was already asleep. The Vampiric Empress continued to stand by Qing Shui’s side but since she didn’t know how to cook, she couldn’t really help Qing Shui much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui!” The Vampiric Empress called out his name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong?” Qing Shui turned around and looked at the Vampiric Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a woman as elegant and noble as her, no matter how one looked at it, she just didn’t seem like the type who would be in a kitchen. It’s to the point that she just didn’t seem to form a good harmony with the entire scene standing there. This was a kind of feeling. In fact, it’s also quite a weird sight to see Qing Shui in a kitchen. He just didn’t look like a great chef, but yet, he was able to produce the most delicious dishes in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shall all women know how to cook?” The Vampiric Empress asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “Men and women are equal. There is no such rule which says that women must know how to cook.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This reminded Qing Shui of his previous incarnation. The majority of great chefs were all men. This was due to the weight of the pan, some of them were too heavy that it posed a problem for the women to flip it as they pleased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Equality?” The Vampiric Empress smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This world is formed by men and women together. Men represent the Yang side, whereas women represent the Yin side of the world. Only when Yin and Yang are balanced will there be everlasting life, only like this will new life be born. This is a form of inheritance.” Qing Shui said in a noble tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And here you go again with your nonsense.” The Vampiric Empress knew that what Qing Shui said was true. But she was embarrassed to admit it, hence, she could only argue back against him in this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It will be finished soon, please wait for a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, but you must promise to teach me how to cook starting tomorrow. When you are gone, I will no longer be able to eat it even if I wanted to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know if she really meant what she said. However, he still nodded in joy, “Rest assured, I will make sure that you learn it quickly. Not only &nbsp;that, I will also make sure that the dishes you prepare, taste almost the same as mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides, the most important thing was the ingredients. Hence, Qing Shui was confident that once she got used to it, she could definitely make it taste good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it’s not a candlelight dinner, it could already be described as something similar to it. The light which shone from the moon looked very nice. The Vampiric Empress looked just like a moonlight beauty sitting down under the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was unable to hold himself back and immediately kissed her on her lips. This wasn’t considered a sneaky kiss. The Vampiric Empress was looking right at him when he was approaching her. Though it hasn’t gotten to the point that Qing Shui would kiss her every day, they have been doing it quite frequently throughout these days. Every time when they kissed, it would last for at least fifteen minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress seemed to have gotten used to the man. Though she was the Vampiric Empress, she was still a woman in the end. Naturally, she would also think like a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone thirsted for relationships. Even the most ordinary people would need it. No matter how cold she might look like, she would also have a world of her own deep within her heart. Every woman would dream for a prince in their life, just like what the fairy from his previous incarnation stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I know that there will come a day when he will appear under the spotlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On that day, he will appear wearing golden armor and sacred clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He will come to marry me with clouds of all seven colors under his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Do you understand that I am no longer a God?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person I love is a hero unrivaled in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day, he will come and marry me while stepping on clouds of seven colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was something which a fairy of his previous incarnation once said. Qing Shui felt that the woman in front of him was very similar to the fairy. She was the Vampiric Empress. Though that was the case, strictly speaking, she could still be considered as an ordinary person. She still had emotions just like everyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took a long time for them to finish their dinner. A faint alluring scent was spreading out across the air. Qing Shui lifted up his head and looked at the Vampiric Empress only to find that she was looking right back at him. She could be seen blushing in a way different than usual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stirred up from looking at her. He could read through the meaning behind her red faces. He remained silent as he carried up the cold yet attractive woman and walked into the bedroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress had her arms around Qing Shui’s neck. Qing Shui lowered his head and kissed on her quivering lips. He knew that other than pure excitement, she also felt a bit worried. It’s natural for a woman to feel excited on their first time. The same thing would also happen to a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately laid on the comfortable bed while carrying her in his arms. The instant he dropped her down onto the bed. It was accompanied by the soft sensation which he felt below his body. It made him feel so comfortable that he felt an urge to yell out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he felt his body on top of a slender and curved figure, he could feel his entire blood surging across his body. He was meticulously kissing her mouth, face and gently nibbling on her earlobes. Following on, he also let out his tongue and started swirling it within her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bright and pinkish earlobe could be seen gradually turning red. Her body was also shivering constantly. Not knowing what to do, she put both of her hands behind Qing Shui’s neck and started responding back to his kisses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kissed her neck and continued moving down slowly. After that, he dug his entire face deep into her upright breasts. He continuously pressed on his face against her nipples despite the clothes separating them. Very quickly, he could already feel her nipples erected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade-like body of the Vampiric Empress could be seen twisting slightly. She was hugging Qing Shui’s neck very tightly. Also, soon after that, soft soul-taking moans could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, despite the clothes being in the way, Qing Shui sucked her erected nipples with his mouth. The Vampiric Empress trembled once again. She was unable to control herself and let out a soft moan. Though hoarse, it sounded extremely attractive, stimulating Qing Shui’s sense of hearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lifted up his head and looked at the cold face. The faint blush around her cheeks was fatally attractive. It was a kind of beauty which words couldn’t describe. Looking at her eyes gave Qing Shui the urge to swiftly take her clothes off her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui observed the perfect, slender body. It looked as white as jade and at the same time also as smooth as wax. When the two bodies perfectly interacted with each other, a pure energy emerged from the Vampiric Empress’ body and got passed on into Qing Shui’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed a bitter smile as he looked at the Vampiric Empress and then he told her about the mnemonic chant. It still wasn’t the time for them to enjoy the moment as waves after waves of Origin Essence could be felt constantly circulating around their body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After about the period of time needed to prepare a cup of tea, Qing Shui noticed that the Goddess Force within his body had once again started moving. It was moving at an even faster pace than the moment when he looked at the twelve portraits. It felt like the rains of light was drizzling across the dry land. This feeling was very comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And to think that it happened under this kind of situation. To Qing Shui, this could be considered as a double comfort. A pure energy started emerging within the Vampiric Empress’ body, causing her strength to improve at a very fast pace. She managed to break through multiple obstacles at one go. At the same time, her strength was also progressing forward rapidly. Her foundation was stabilized even more like a skyscraper that was being built from its base.</span></p>
