  <p><strong>AST 182 The 3rd Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm</strong></p>
  <p>It was intuition!</p>
  <p>“Mmm, you are Daddy, so of course I will follow Daddy.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was really speechless. He wondered what his goddess-like master would think if he were to bring this lass to her.</p>
  <p>“Then, what do we do about this big tiger?” Qing Shui looked at this “daughter” and asked.</p>
  <p>“Ignore it, it will leave by itself. When needed, it will appear again when I call for it. It’s just like how we cannot see Little Grey and Little White now.” The lass said happily.</p>
  <p>“Little Grey? Little White?” Qing Shui asked puzzledly.</p>
  <p>“Stupid Daddy. It’s the other two fellows.”</p>
  <p>After saying this, she called out in her childish voice, “Little Grey, Little White!”</p>
  <p>A shrill condor’s cry and a loud bear’s roar sounded out!</p>
  <p>Within a few breaths time, Qing Shui stared at a condor whose white feathers did not lose out to the Snow White Crane and a mountainous grey grizzly bear with a height of more than 5 metres.</p>
  <p>All three of them were demonic beasts…</p>
  <p>“Luan Luan, you can make them listen to you?”</p>
  <p>“Only Little White, Little Grey, and Little Tiger. The rest of them don’t listen to Luan Luan. I even ask Little Tiger, Little Grey, and Little White to beat up those who don’t listen.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui: “…”</p>
  <p>“Once, I saw a big fire lion the other time. It was very pretty but didn’t listen to me. I got Little White, Little Grey, and Little Tiger to give it a beating, but Little White picked me up and ran off. Little Grey and Little Tiger also ran for their lives.” Luan Luan pouted her lips and said angrily.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was speechless. That gigantic fire lion was probably much more stronger than these three demonic monsters. It seemed like the lass could only currently tame three demonic monsters, but it still made Qing Shui feel that the comparisons were odious. Most importantly, it would be a smooth-sailing journey for this girl to attain Xiantian in the future, or possibly even the Realm of the Martial King and Martial Saint.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carried the lass up to the horse carriage, and they safely passed through the valley. After reaching the wide, flat path when entering the other half of Cang Lang Country, the rocky carriage stabilized.</p>
  <p>When the evening sun set, Qing Shui held onto the lass’s hand and stood at the bottom of the Thousand Buddha Cave!</p>
  <p>“Daddy, what is this? Why are there so many people?” Luan Luan asked in her childish voice.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui led the little girl whose beauty could lead to the fall of countries and cities down the carriage, they attracted countless gazes from those around them. All were directed at Luan Luan and Qing Shui lamented the lethal beauty of this lass.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go, I’ll bring you to see the Golden Buddha!”</p>
  <p>“Daddy, carry!” Luan Luan stretched out her hands and said in a crisp and melodious voice!</p>
  <p>This time around, envious gazes were thrown at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“If only I could have an angelic daughter like her.” An uncle lamented.</p>
  <p>“How could you even dream of having such a beautiful daughter with your filthy looks?”</p>
  <p>Uncle: “…”</p>
  <p>“Only that kind of charming guy can have such a cute little angel for a kid.”</p>
  <p>“The mother of that little angel is definitely a peerless beauty.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was speechless!</p>
  <p>Entering the Thousand Buddha Cave, Qing Shui realized that it was much bigger than expected. Qing Shui even had the feeling that it was hollow, as if it was a wide hall with a height of more than 100 metres. Qing Shui could not see the end of the winding path, and the human traffic made it seem as if it was a populated marketplace. </p>
  <p>“Daddy, I want this… I want that!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui realised that there were no Buddha statues around when he first stepped into the Thousand Buddha Cave. However, there were many small stalls around, and even restaurants and inns were set up on the walls that seemed to be like caves.</p>
  <p>Every time Luan Luan came across small items, she would reach out to grab them. After all, she was only a kid.</p>
  <p>“Luan Luan, I will buy you anything you like. Remember, we need to pay for these things.” Qing Shui realised that he would need to teach this lass some common sense.</p>
  <p>He brought Luan Luan past a corner. Only when they went in and he saw many huge Golden Buddha statues did Qing Shui discover how magnificent and shocking it was. Many giant Golden Buddha statues, each with a height of over 50 metres, were placed in specific spots.</p>
  <p>Each of them had a strange stance. Qing Shui led Luan Luan around as they walked in the crowd. He had a feeling as if he was almost getting something, but not yet being able to grasp it.</p>
  <p>Without realizing it, Qing Shui’s hand started to mimic the stances of those statues, gradually getting faster and faster. His sharp vision scanned across each of the giant Golden Buddha statues as he headed for the interior of the Thousand Buddha Cave.</p>
  <p>The Qi technique of the 3rd Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm that he had not been able to grasp started to move automatically. It progressed smoothly without resistance to form a cycle before naturally shooting out from his hands!</p>
  <p>Three strong waves shot out suddenly. Before it exploded, Qing Shui tried to suppress his Qi, but it was too late. While there were not many people around him since he had walked very fast, the ones that were there all turned to look at him in astonishment.</p>
  <p>Completed. The 3rd Wave was completed. Qing Shui was overjoyed. It was the feeling as if he had discovered that a peerless beauty had been having a crush on him.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, he realised that the lass was gone. Shocked, Qing Shui quickly turned back as fast as he could down the path he came from.</p>
  <p>On the way, he found Luan Luan looking at him bitterly. Qing Shui was guilt-stricken and he gave the lass a big hug. Spending less than half a day with her, Qing Shui realised that she had taken up an important position in his heart.</p>
  <p>Was it because she looked very similar to his goddess-like master?</p>
  <p>“Is Daddy going to leave Luan Luan behind as well?” Luan Luan pouted her lips and said, aggrieved. Gloom filled up her big and shiny eyes!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui hugged her tightly, feeling very sad that a young child would have such a gaze on her. “Luan Luan, don’t cry. I promise you that I’ll never leave you, alright?”</p>
  <p>“Promise?” Luan Luan lifted her head and said seriously.</p>
  <p>“Promise, I’ll definitely stay true to my words!”</p>
  <p>“Pinky swear!” Luan Luan reached out her little finger.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he reached out his little finger and hook it with Luan Luan’s. It felt very heart-warming. Qing Shui did not know how it felt like to be a father, but he believed that it should be similar to what he felt just then.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carried Luan Luan and once again looked towards these huge Golden Buddha statues. Could it be that the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palms that he attained by luck from killing someone was related to these Golden Buddha statues?</p>
  <p>Puzzled, Qing Shui thought about it as he continued to look at each of them, one by one. However, he no longer found the feeling from before. While each of their stances were different, Qing Shui still did not feel anything. However, he forced himself to engrain all the stances of the thousand Golden Buddha statues into his mind which was possible with his extraordinarily retentive memory.</p>
  <p>Unknowingly, he realized that he was the only one left in the Thousand Buddha Cave. It was already late and the lass in his arms had fallen asleep. Qing Shui changed to a princess carry so that she could sleep more comfortably.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could not understand how the lass would have a snow-white fox fur coat with her. She was very clean because not only was there no stench on her, but she also had a smell unique to little kids. Moreover, how did she survive all this time with no one to care for her…?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui got a room at the entrance of the Thousand Buddha Cave and laid the lass comfortably on the bed, covering her with a blanket before he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>3rd Wave!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui repeatedly practiced, and even attempted to try to merge it with stances from the Tiger’s Roar and Solitary Rapid Fist. Unfortunately, even after multiple attempts, he did not succeed.</p>
  <p>Feeling the rhythm of the 3rd Wave, Qing Shui gradually included it with the stances of the Golden Buddha statues which he had forced himself to remember. He was able to repetitively attack, producing a strong killing force which made him feel extremely comfortable.</p>
  <p>“Haha, this is the genuine prowess of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui repetitively and crazily hit into the air of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The potent impact thrusted into the air, causing a loud rumble which sounded like the sound of Buddha. Its effects were nerve-wracking.</p>
  <p>In the following moments, Qing Shui used almost all the stances of the Golden Buddha statues to display the 3rd Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, until he completely wiped out the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique in his Dantian.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui happily laid down on the ground of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. To think that he would gain so much from just one trip to the Thousand Buddha Cave. Not only did he comprehend the 3rd Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, but also he even managed to pick up such an unbelievable little girl.</p>

 <p>“Promise, I’ll definitely stay true to my words!”</p>
 <p>“Pinky swear!” Luan Luan reached out her little finger.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he reached out his little finger and hook it with Luan Luan’s. It felt very heart-warming. Qing Shui did not know how it felt like to be a father, but he believed that it should be similar to what he felt just then.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried Luan Luan and once again looked towards these huge Golden Buddha statues. Could it be that the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palms that he attained by luck from killing someone was related to these Golden Buddha statues?</p>
 <p>Puzzled, Qing Shui thought about it as he continued to look at each of them, one by one. However, he no longer found the feeling from before. While each of their stances were different, Qing Shui still did not feel anything. However, he forced himself to engrain all the stances of the thousand Golden Buddha statues into his mind which was possible with his extraordinarily retentive memory.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, he realized that he was the only one left in the Thousand Buddha Cave. It was already late and the lass in his arms had fallen asleep. Qing Shui changed to a princess carry so that she could sleep more comfortably.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not understand how the lass would have a snow-white fox fur coat with her. She was very clean because not only was there no stench on her, but she also had a smell unique to little kids. Moreover, how did she survive all this time with no one to care for her…?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got a room at the entrance of the Thousand Buddha Cave and laid the lass comfortably on the bed, covering her with a blanket before he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>3rd Wave!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui repeatedly practiced, and even attempted to try to merge it with stances from the Tiger’s Roar and Solitary Rapid Fist. Unfortunately, even after multiple attempts, he did not succeed.</p>
 <p>Feeling the rhythm of the 3rd Wave, Qing Shui gradually included it with the stances of the Golden Buddha statues which he had forced himself to remember. He was able to repetitively attack, producing a strong killing force which made him feel extremely comfortable.</p>
 <p>“Haha, this is the genuine prowess of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui repetitively and crazily hit into the air of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The potent impact thrusted into the air, causing a loud rumble which sounded like the sound of Buddha. Its effects were nerve-wracking.</p>
 <p>In the following moments, Qing Shui used almost all the stances of the Golden Buddha statues to display the 3rd Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, until he completely wiped out the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique in his Dantian.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui happily laid down on the ground of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. To think that he would gain so much from just one trip to the Thousand Buddha Cave. Not only did he comprehend the 3rd Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, but also he even managed to pick up such an unbelievable little girl.</p>
