 <p><strong>AST 1246 - Two Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beast, Treasure hunting Pig, Jade Emperor Queen Bee, Luck </strong></p>
 <p>All of the medicinal herbs were ready-made. Naturally, Qing Shui planned to immediately refine the Spiritual Beast Pills. However, before this, he first scattered those seeds across the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He only started to refine the medicines after finishing.</p>
 <p>He took out all of the medicinal materials. All of these were medicinal herbs which were near or had even reached ten thousand years of life. It could be seen just how precious Spiritual Beast Pills were. Considering that it was a medicinal pill which required these kinds of medicinal herbs to refine, it was impossible for it to be low-grade.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also prepared the Golden Snake Grass. This time, no failure could be tolerated. He needed to nurture his own Spiritual Medicinal Beasts as soon as possible. Only by then would he be able to ensure a sufficient amount of medicinal herbs to refine powerful medicinal pills. By then, he as well as his clan members and his friends would be able to be even more powerful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui threw in almost all of those medicinal herbs and after spending ten days refining them, he finally succeeded in producing it. He opened the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron with excitement only to see two medicinal pills the size of walnuts at the bottom of the cauldron. They were shining with majestic lights and they were filled with spiritual nature.</p>
 <p>Only two of them?</p>
 <p>So much medicinal ingredients were used and yet eventually, he only was able to refine two of them. This really surprised Qing Shui. After all, he was planning to pick a few of his demonic beasts later to see which ones were the most suitable to turn into Spiritual Medicinal Beasts. Now, he could only look for two of them. He only had one chance to look for one which could flip over the ground and the other one which could carry out pollinations.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and immediately went to rest. It had been a few days since he last rested. He was already really exhausted. Hence he decided to only think about which demonic beasts he should give the Spiritual Beast Pills to after he replenished his energy.</p>
 <p>After eight hours, Qing Shui woke up on time. After eating a bit of food, he started wondering which demonic beasts he should turn into Spiritual Medicinal Beasts.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I haven’t seen its effect.”</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thought about this, he quickly went towards the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, opened it and looked at the Spiritual Beast Pills.</p>
 <p>Spiritual Beast Pill!</p>
 <p>It was refined with precious medicinal materials. It contained a powerful spiritual nature.</p>
 <p>Effect: It could help turn the target into Spiritual Beast or Spiritual Medicinal Beast. It also helped increase the beast’s cultivation and abilities within a suitable range. No after-effects. It works for all beast species. There is also a fixed chance of failure. Once it fails, it will only help increase a bit of the beast’s strength and innate talent.</p>
 <p>He closed the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and let out a sigh of relief in his heart. The Spiritual Beast Pill was still considered to be quite decent. It only had benefits for demonic beasts. Even if it was unsuitable for the beasts or the beasts were unable to turn into Spiritual Medicinal Beasts, it was still fine. At least it could help increase a bit of their hidden talent or innate skills as well as their cultivation.</p>
 <p>Therefore it was said that to beasts, there were only benefits and no harm.</p>
 <p>Treasure Hunting Pig!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out for the Treasure Hunting Pig. This little thing originally already possessed very powerful Spiritual Nature of Heaven and Earth. It was a treasure beast. A beast species which was filled with spiritual nature. Qing Shui took out a Spiritual Beast Pill and put it in front of it.</p>
 <p>The gold little pig had thirsty eyes. This little thing was very intelligent. Without saying anything, Qing Shui immediately fed it the Spiritual Beast Pill. In any case, there was nothing bad about it.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the Treasure Hunting Pig shone with golden light. Its body was still one foot long and round. However, Qing Shui felt that it changed. There seemed to be a new kind of spiritual qi within it now.</p>
 <p>It’s done! Qing Shui looked at the Treasure Hunting Pig happily. Everything could be seen clearly with the Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui was the happiest about was that the Treasure Hunting Pig had immediately ascended to a Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beast. He remembered from the book “Spiritual Medicinal Beast” that even if a demonic beast possessed decent innate talent, upon taking in the Spiritual Beast Pill, it would only become a Grade One Spiritual Medicinal Beast. This was already considered to be really powerful. The majority would even require a very long time to turn into a Grade One Spiritual Medicinal Beast upon consuming it.</p>
 <p>Of course, there were examples of beasts which immediately turned into Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beasts as well but those were all ancient ultra mutated species. Qing Shui never expected the Treasure Hunting Pig to really have an unusual origin. To think that it would immediately ascend to Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beast.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>Treasure Hunting Pig, Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beast!</p>
 <p>“Hm, Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beast?” Qing Shui curiously tried to see if there were any changes.</p>
 <p>The entire body of the Treasure Hunting Pig was as tough as diamond. There was a fearsome golden qi and treasure qi contained within its body. It was capable of automatically getting away at the moment it got attacked.</p>
 <p>Everytime, Qing Shui was shocked with the unusual aspects of this tiny thing. Basically, very few were capable of hurting the Treasure Hunting Pig. The reason being that it could penetrate through almost anything which intended to confine it. Even if it was consumed by a demonic beast, it would still be useless. The pig could still open up a hole in its body and run away. It neglected any spirit energy or poison attacks.</p>
 <p>This was exactly like the existence of the toughest hedgehog. No one was able to swallow it.</p>
 <p>Ability: Treasure hunt, create Spiritual Farm and upgrade.</p>
 <p>Treasure Pig Golden Qi: Passive battle technique, permanently raise its speed by eight times. Could be upgraded. Zero Consumption.</p>
 <p>Yeah, it has become faster. Qing Shui was stunned.</p>
 <p>It was not that the Spiritual Medicinal Beast was unable to become a powerful demonic beast. It was just that the majority of Spiritual Medicinal Beasts were proven to be ineffective in battles. Only a minority were capable of turning into a formidable existence with fearsome strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made the Treasure Hunting Pig go to the medicinal farm nearby to display its ability as a Spiritual Medicinal Beast. After that, he could already see the Treasure Hunting Pig drilling underground. The only thing seen was the surface of the earth shaking slightly. It was just as if something was flipping over the ground as rows after rows formed.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the Treasure Hunting Pig went around the majority of the land within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and came back.</p>
 <p>“That’s it?” Qing Shui felt really doubtful.</p>
 <p>After that, he leaned over and pinched a handful of soil. He tried to sense the bits of spiritual qi within it.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew why the strength of Spiritual Medicinal Beast could no longer be more powerful. The reason for that was because the spiritual qi within their body was already scattered across the soil. The Spiritual Beast Pill could let their body contain even more spiritual qi and then help them release it. Only Spiritual Medicinal Beasts was capable of achieving such a feat.</p>
 <p>By releasing the spiritual qi within its body, the rate at which the Spiritual Medicinal Beasts raised their strength would naturally become slower. Hence, unless a demonic beast had extremely good innate talent, it wouldn’t be able to turn into a powerful battle beast.</p>
 <p>But there was still one more point, the Spiritual Medicinal Beasts kept watch over the Spiritual Medicine. If a Spiritual Medicinal Beast was put in a medicinal farm with spiritual medicines with unusually powerful ages, then it would be able to absorb the powerful medicinal strength within the medicinal farm. If the species of the beast was powerful, the rate at which it improved would also be just as fast as those powerful demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the Treasure Hunting Pig could also evolve into a powerful battle beast?” Qing Shui himself also found it hard to believe. In his hand, he was holding this cute little thing, which other than looking cute, only had the features of having powerful survival as well as treasure hunting skills.</p>
 <p>However, this little thing was a bit similar than the Earth Devouring Mouse. It could drill through the ground. It was just that the Earth Devouring Mouse was very fast. However, the Treasure Hunting Pig could also go underwater as well as go into fire. Its entire body was invulnerable. Even a powerful warrior would find it very difficult to deal damage to it. However, the Treasure Hunting Pig naturally could be easily blasted away by pure force. Or else, the Treasure Hunting Pig would have been able to drill through the strong warrior’s body.</p>
 <p>Of course, before the evolution, the Treasure Hunting Pig’s speed was terrible. Within this period of time, it was already enough for the enemy to smash away the Treasure Hunting Pig about a hundred times.</p>
 <p>But now, the speed of the Treasure Hunting Pig which had now turned into a Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beast was now eight times faster than before. Furthermore, the functions all around its body also seemed to have gotten even more powerful. With the addition of its speed, the Treasure Hunting Beast was definitely a terrifying existence. What was even more fearsome about it was that following its conversion into a Spiritual Medicinal Beast and ascension in grade, it became a lot more intelligent. This was what was the most fearsome.</p>
 <p>The Treasure Hunting Pig was born timid. This was also why it was unable to turn into a powerful battle beast. Originally, it was undisputably powerful in resisting attacks. It could ignore spirit energy attacks and very little damage could be caused to its physical body. Since Qing Shui wasn’t doing much at the moment, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant could only smash it and stomp it. Despite this, it still remained unscratched. The golden qi within its body was way too powerful.</p>
 <p>In the past, Qing Shui had thought about making the Treasure Hunting Pig a powerful demonic beast before. It was precisely because of its ability to resist attacks. But despite experimenting with it a few times, it was still no use. It was timid, as if it had no heart to continue fighting and only wanted to run away. This was also how he lost his intention to do so.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui looked at the Treasure Hunting Pig, he couldn’t help but think about Mu Qing. The Treasure Hunting Pig was something given to him by her. If possible, he felt that he could make those Treasure Hunting Pigs of hers turn into formidable existences as well.</p>
 <p>Upon communicating with the Treasure Hunting Pig through his consciousness, Qing Shui noticed a significant change. It seemed to be even more daring now.</p>
 <p>Now, the Treasure Hunting Pig was considered to have grown beyond Qing Shui’s expectations. It immediately turned into a Grade Two Spiritual Medicinal Beast, so much so that it might even end up a terrifying existence in the future. For now, Qing Shui chose not to think about it. The most important thing for him to do now was to nurture the Panacea.</p>
 <p>The only one left was the pollination type. Qing Shui had considered it over and over again before eventually settling on the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. After all, upon turning into a Spiritual Medicinal Beast, the later generations of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee would very likely be even more outstanding. Furthermore, the quality of the queen bee nectar would also improve a lot.</p>
 <p>Initially, Qing Shui wanted to give the chance to the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly. But after repeated careful consideration, he felt that it was better to give it to the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. He would refine Spiritual Beast Pill again when he managed to collect more medicinal herbs in the future. By then, he would let it consume one and treat it as helping his demonic beasts raise a bit of their strength.</p>
 <p>Just because a demonic beast was powerful, it didn’t necessarily mean that it would be able to become a Spiritual Medicinal Beast. For example, the earthworm type or in other words, bug type demonic beasts, would find it relatively easy to turn into Spiritual Medicinal Beasts. As for the other beasts, there were higher chances they would turn into Spiritual Beast instead.</p>
 <p>Just like the rest of Qing Shui’s demonic beasts, it was basically also considered a spiritual beast now. It was just that upon consuming the Spiritual Beast Pill, it would be even more powerful.</p>
 <p>This was also the reason why Qing Shui chose the Treasure Hunting Pig and Jade Emperor Queen Bee. There would be a higher chance for them to turn into Spiritual Medicinal Beast. Prior to this, he was really scared that the Treasure Hunting Pig would end up becoming a Spiritual Beast instead of a Spiritual Medicinal Beast.</p>
 <p>This was good. Not only was it a treasure beast, it was also a Spiritual Medicinal Beast. This little thing could already be considered a priceless treasure. The reason being that only through becoming a Spiritual Medicinal Beast would it turn into a powerful battle beast.</p>
 <p>Actually, before using it, Qing Shui had communicated with his demonic beasts through his consciousness. There was still another reason why Qing Shui chose the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. It was the product of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Letting it turn into a Spiritual Medicinal Beast should bring about an even better effect.</p>
 <p>At least it should be better than the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly.</p>
 <p>The body of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee started giving off bright light upon taking the Spiritual Beast Pill. What Qing Shui was surprised about was the body of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee actually shrunk. It was already a demonic beast which was already about ten meters across to begin with and yet now, it was once again shrinking swiftly.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui wasn’t worried, the reason being that even though he could feel that the body of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee shrinking, the aura as well as spiritual qi in it was increasing.</p>
 <p>Despite its small size, it was still a queen. It possessed a natural kind of temper of a monarch.</p>
 <p>The body of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee shrunk slowly and only came to a stop when it was no smaller than around two meters. It was half the size of ordinary Jade Emperor Bees. Its body had turned gold. Furthermore, on top of its head, there was a thing which resembled a small golden crown.</p>
 <p>It had most likely succeeded.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Jade Emperor Queen Bee joyfully.</p>
 <p>Jade Emperor Queen Bee! Grade Two Spiritual Medicine Beast!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Just what kind of luck was he in today? An incident recorded within the ancient book which was said to only be met with once every hundred years… He had actually managed to run into it twice today.</p>
 <p>Originally, the Jade Emperor Bee was supposed to be very weak. But now, it had actually managed to improve significantly.</p>
 <p>Its raw strength was now worth a hundred nimbus!</p>
 <p>Jade Emperor Force. Increase the raw strength of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee by ten times. Zero consumption. It could give orders to the insects a hundred li within its surroundings.</p>
 <p>Bee Tail Needle, it contained formidable toxicity.</p>
 <p>Flower Powder Poison, it could give off terrifying flower powder poison.</p>
