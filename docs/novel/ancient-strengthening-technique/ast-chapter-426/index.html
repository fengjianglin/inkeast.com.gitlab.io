 <p><strong>Chapter 426 Refining Talisman-shaped Beast Skin, Resolution, Decision.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 426 - Refining Talisman-shaped Beast Skin, Resolution, Decision</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui calmed himself down. He picked up a piece of the Talisman-shaped Beast Skin and started to refine it. He continuously sorted the veined patterns of the Beast Skin, tightening, modifying and treating it with his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. He refined it from the inside out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For the last step, Qing Shui carefully controlled the two most prominent and thick intersecting lines which had been refined. He exerted himself and a “swastika” symbol appeared in the middle of the skin. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, a faint golden glow appeared. Qing Shui almost cheered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Finished!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Just like that! ”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was totally immersed in his joy and simply did not think about the "swastika" symbol. Subsequently, he successfully made a few more of them before he calmed down to acknowledge that his conjecture was right.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he could only see the “veined patterns” on the beast skins when he used his Heavenly Vision Technique. If he did not use Heavenly Vision Technique and only used his Spirit Sense, it would be like comparing a person who sees to a person who hears. In any case, being able to see certainly beats hearing when searching for a precise spot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There is a saying that “Practice makes perfect”. &nbsp;Perhaps, there were others that can feel the "swastika". Lin Zhanhan may not know that a "swastika" will form, but he knew what needed to be done at that point. However, it was uncertain why he did not inform Qing Shui about it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After successful refining the Talisman-shaped Beast Skin, Qing Shui was in an exceptionally happy mood. He just had to refine the beast blood next. Once he was successful, he could start to practice drawing the Talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed quickly in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Half a month had already passed. While refining beast blood was simpler than refining beast skins, Qing Shui met no success. However, he was already very familiar with the process of refining beast skins.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he woke up, Qing Shui went to the top floor of Earthly Paradise, as he could do his morning practices there. Before he could reach, he heard the pleasant sound of weapons clashing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After looking from a distance, he saw that two women were practicing their Sword Dance. All of Huoyun Liu-Li’s Sword Dance skills were taught by Canghai Mingyue. At this moment, their long swords were crossed, blow after blow.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Loud clashes filled the air. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they saw Qing Shui, both of them suddenly locked on to him and charged towards him. Their weaving steps and moving figures were a sight to behold.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. In terms of speed, even though both of them were using Sword Dance steps, it was impossible to match Qing Shui. Qing Shui stepped forward three steps, then another step and quickly took two steps backwards. This was all done in a split second.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stepped forward again, passing through the gap between the two ladies. At the same time, both his hands grabbed on to each of the ladies’ sword wielding hand.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So both of you are working together, intending to kill your own husband.” Qing Shui teased.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li gave a lovely smile as she gave Qing Shui a little nibble on his face. Qing Shui was stunned. She looked at Canghai Mingyue. The reason was very obvious.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nice try!” Canghai Mingyue said abashedly as she pushed Qing Shui’s hand away. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the late afternoon, Qing Shui helped reinforce Canghai Mingyue’s meridians again. This time, she could feel a 20% increase.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was really amazed. Not only was the first reinforcement 30%, but the second reinforcement was 20%. That meant a ⅓ reduction in the effectiveness as compared to the norm of ½ .</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As the time required for the second reinforcement was half of the first time, it was not as awkward for both Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui held on to her slender jade white legs, he closed his eyes. At the same time, Canghai Mingyue looked at him silently with a complex expression on her face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will go back to Skyword Sect for a while. I will be back soon. Wait for me to come back before attempting the next breakthrough. I can help you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After saying his farewells to both of the ladies, Qing Shui rode on his Firebird and headed towards the Skysword Sect.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left his Diamond Demonic Boar at Earthly Paradise. After all, that little thing could defend itself if it faced any low grade Martial King level warrior. It had high defense and attack. Even just one attack from its sharp claws or teeth on one’s weak spot could be fatal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had heard that the guardian beast in Skysword Sect was at the same level as his Diamond Demonic Boar, at the peak of Xianfeng level. But Qing Shui had no interest to look at it now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui climbed up the main peak to see Baili Jingwei. When Baili Jingwei saw Qing Shui, he was extremely happy. As he talked to Qing Shui, he would pull Qing Shui around warm heartedly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Senior Martial Uncle, you had a breakthrough.” Qing Shui looked at Baili Jingwei and smiled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I was lucky, so I managed to reach a breakthrough. Qing Shui, you should stop calling me Senior Martial Uncle and stop calling Jiange your master. In the future, look for a master who can really teach you a true set of skills,” Baili Jingwei said in quite a serious tone. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, I told him this many times but he just won’t listen.” Yiye Jiange walked over at this time</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master!” Qing Shui called out gently. In his mind, he thought about the third portrait of beauty. The woman in that portrait was indeed his master, this transcendent beauty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, are you heading to Heaven Palace again?” Yiye Jiange asked with a gentle smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such an exceptionally intelligent woman like her could easily guess what Qing Shui wanted to do. Actually, Yiye Jiange had an odd feeling towards Qing Shui. The youth that she once had to protect had now became someone that so many people looked up to.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master, where is Luan Luan?” Qing Shui asked her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She went out to play. She won’t be back until it is her mealtime. If she knew that you were here, she will be ecstatic,” Yiye Jiange replied. Qing Shui could see a sort of motherly kindness in her face whenever it came to Luan Luan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After chatting for awhile with Baili JIngwei, Qing Shui returned to Cloud Mist Peak with Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took one of Yiye Jiange’s steeds. Standing beside her, Qing Shui felt a sense of serenity. This had nothing to do with any abilities, but there was a sort of serenity in his heart.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, congratulations!” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and laughed lightly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master, why are you congratulating me?” Qing Shui asked. He was surprised.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Regarding Yan Clan!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh that. Well..” Qing Shui laughed as he touched his nose.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The was a clear bright call from a condor.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lifted his head and saw a white feathered condor. When he saw the delicate little girl sitting on it, he laughed happily.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The white feathered condor swooped down. Luan Luan directly jumped off the white feathered condor when she was still metres above from the ground. A rambunctious laughter filled the air.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui forced a smile as he immediately used the Taichi Diversion technique to grab her. The little lass trusted him too much. Qing Shui was not sure if he should be glad or worried.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, where did you go? Why haven’t you visited Luan Luan for such a long time?” The little lass complained pitifully as she hugged Qing Shui’s neck whilst being in his embrace. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a little sad when he heard that. In any case, she called him “Daddy”. He knew that she was her refuge. He could not help but think of Little Yuchang. The girl who had relied on him. Before he left, she yelled, “Daddy, I don’t want to go…” It was heart-wrenching for him each time he remembered that.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Qing Shui, what’s wrong? You don’t look well.” Yiye Jiange asked with concerned as she saw Qing Shui’s face turn white. She seemed to be trying very hard to suppress some sort of emotion.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was pulled back to reality as he quickly resolved to throw away those painful thoughts. Being too caught up by those difficult emotions and thoughts could be fatal. Only forgetting. Temporarily forgetting. Before he became strong, he had to forget that hatred. That was the most rational choice.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry too much about the issue that involves Luan Luan. Master, you must supervise her cultivation. Maybe in twenty years’ time, I will accompany you and Luan Luan to Lion King’s Ridge to get a proper resolution.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dared to say that because of the existence of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Twenty years was about over six hundred years in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. By six hundred years, he should at least be at the peak grade of the Martial Saint Level. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spent the whole afternoon with Luan Luan while Yiye Jiange stayed around. For the whole afternoon, the little lass called out “dad” and “mum” countless times. She was already used to it now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the afternoon passed, Qing Shui watched as the little lass fell asleep. Qing Shui prepared to go over to look for Wenren Wushuang. After Wenren Wugou died, her temperament had changed greatly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he arrived at Zhu Qing Peak, Qing Shui did not visit Zhu Qing first. He decided to visit Wenren Wushuang and then stay at Zhu Qing’s place for the night if circumstances permitted it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found Wenren Wushuang practicing behind the mountain, around where Qing Shui had discovered Zhu Qing’s secret. When he laid eyes on her, his heart ached slightly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a span of over half a year, Wenren Wushuang had already improved from Grade 2 Xiantian to Grade 3 Xiantian. The woman who had a girl-next-door temperament was now colder than Shi Qing Zhuang.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui approached slowly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Wenren Wushang saw Qing Shui, she was startled for a moment before she gave a look acknowledging him as an acquaintance. This made Qing Shui feel bad but mostly sad for her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had started to isolate herself. She had started to lose her trust in people. but Qing Shui saw a shred of emotion in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang!” Qing Shui called out gently.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui. You’re here.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very sad when he heard her voice. It was as if she was a totally different person. She was lonely. In the past, she had a sister. When her sister was around, she was so warm, so homely, and she was not alone in this world.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ignoring her protest, Qing Shui held her hand.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Wenren Wushuang used her free hand and hit Qing Shui’s chest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not move. He let her hammer him with one of her fists, but he did not release her other hand.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peng Peng Peng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not even use his skills.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A stream of blood flowed from his mouth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why don’t you dodge? Why don’t you use your skills? Why do you let me do this to you..” Wenren Wushuang continued as she started to cry.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, I understand you. You still have me. You still have me.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui did not say it out blankly, she knew that he wanted to convey that he still cared for her, and will not guard against her. She could rely on him and he would do anything for her just as she did.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was leaving and he did not know how long he would need to stay at the Heavenly Palace. He did not wish to see Wenren Wushang cut herself off totally. No matter what, he wanted her to open up to him.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li gave a lovely smile as she gave Qing Shui a little nibble on his face. Qing Shui was stunned. She looked at Canghai Mingyue. The reason was very obvious.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Nice try!” Canghai Mingyue said abashedly as she pushed Qing Shui’s hand away. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the late afternoon, Qing Shui helped reinforce Canghai Mingyue’s meridians again. This time, she could feel a 20% increase.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was really amazed. Not only was the first reinforcement 30%, but the second reinforcement was 20%. That meant a ⅓ reduction in the effectiveness as compared to the norm of ½ .</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As the time required for the second reinforcement was half of the first time, it was not as awkward for both Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui held on to her slender jade white legs, he closed his eyes. At the same time, Canghai Mingyue looked at him silently with a complex expression on her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will go back to Skyword Sect for a while. I will be back soon. Wait for me to come back before attempting the next breakthrough. I can help you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After saying his farewells to both of the ladies, Qing Shui rode on his Firebird and headed towards the Skysword Sect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left his Diamond Demonic Boar at Earthly Paradise. After all, that little thing could defend itself if it faced any low grade Martial King level warrior. It had high defense and attack. Even just one attack from its sharp claws or teeth on one’s weak spot could be fatal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had heard that the guardian beast in Skysword Sect was at the same level as his Diamond Demonic Boar, at the peak of Xianfeng level. But Qing Shui had no interest to look at it now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui climbed up the main peak to see Baili Jingwei. When Baili Jingwei saw Qing Shui, he was extremely happy. As he talked to Qing Shui, he would pull Qing Shui around warm heartedly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Senior Martial Uncle, you had a breakthrough.” Qing Shui looked at Baili Jingwei and smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I was lucky, so I managed to reach a breakthrough. Qing Shui, you should stop calling me Senior Martial Uncle and stop calling Jiange your master. In the future, look for a master who can really teach you a true set of skills,” Baili Jingwei said in quite a serious tone. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, I told him this many times but he just won’t listen.” Yiye Jiange walked over at this time</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master!” Qing Shui called out gently. In his mind, he thought about the third portrait of beauty. The woman in that portrait was indeed his master, this transcendent beauty.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, are you heading to Heaven Palace again?” Yiye Jiange asked with a gentle smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Such an exceptionally intelligent woman like her could easily guess what Qing Shui wanted to do. Actually, Yiye Jiange had an odd feeling towards Qing Shui. The youth that she once had to protect had now became someone that so many people looked up to.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master, where is Luan Luan?” Qing Shui asked her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“She went out to play. She won’t be back until it is her mealtime. If she knew that you were here, she will be ecstatic,” Yiye Jiange replied. Qing Shui could see a sort of motherly kindness in her face whenever it came to Luan Luan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After chatting for awhile with Baili JIngwei, Qing Shui returned to Cloud Mist Peak with Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took one of Yiye Jiange’s steeds. Standing beside her, Qing Shui felt a sense of serenity. This had nothing to do with any abilities, but there was a sort of serenity in his heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, congratulations!” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and laughed lightly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master, why are you congratulating me?” Qing Shui asked. He was surprised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Regarding Yan Clan!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh that. Well..” Qing Shui laughed as he touched his nose.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The was a clear bright call from a condor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lifted his head and saw a white feathered condor. When he saw the delicate little girl sitting on it, he laughed happily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The white feathered condor swooped down. Luan Luan directly jumped off the white feathered condor when she was still metres above from the ground. A rambunctious laughter filled the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui forced a smile as he immediately used the Taichi Diversion technique to grab her. The little lass trusted him too much. Qing Shui was not sure if he should be glad or worried.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, where did you go? Why haven’t you visited Luan Luan for such a long time?” The little lass complained pitifully as she hugged Qing Shui’s neck whilst being in his embrace. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a little sad when he heard that. In any case, she called him “Daddy”. He knew that she was her refuge. He could not help but think of Little Yuchang. The girl who had relied on him. Before he left, she yelled, “Daddy, I don’t want to go…” It was heart-wrenching for him each time he remembered that.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Qing Shui, what’s wrong? You don’t look well.” Yiye Jiange asked with concerned as she saw Qing Shui’s face turn white. She seemed to be trying very hard to suppress some sort of emotion.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was pulled back to reality as he quickly resolved to throw away those painful thoughts. Being too caught up by those difficult emotions and thoughts could be fatal. Only forgetting. Temporarily forgetting. Before he became strong, he had to forget that hatred. That was the most rational choice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry too much about the issue that involves Luan Luan. Master, you must supervise her cultivation. Maybe in twenty years’ time, I will accompany you and Luan Luan to Lion King’s Ridge to get a proper resolution.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dared to say that because of the existence of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Twenty years was about over six hundred years in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. By six hundred years, he should at least be at the peak grade of the Martial Saint Level. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spent the whole afternoon with Luan Luan while Yiye Jiange stayed around. For the whole afternoon, the little lass called out “dad” and “mum” countless times. She was already used to it now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the afternoon passed, Qing Shui watched as the little lass fell asleep. Qing Shui prepared to go over to look for Wenren Wushuang. After Wenren Wugou died, her temperament had changed greatly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he arrived at Zhu Qing Peak, Qing Shui did not visit Zhu Qing first. He decided to visit Wenren Wushuang and then stay at Zhu Qing’s place for the night if circumstances permitted it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found Wenren Wushuang practicing behind the mountain, around where Qing Shui had discovered Zhu Qing’s secret. When he laid eyes on her, his heart ached slightly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In a span of over half a year, Wenren Wushuang had already improved from Grade 2 Xiantian to Grade 3 Xiantian. The woman who had a girl-next-door temperament was now colder than Shi Qing Zhuang.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui approached slowly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Wenren Wushang saw Qing Shui, she was startled for a moment before she gave a look acknowledging him as an acquaintance. This made Qing Shui feel bad but mostly sad for her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had started to isolate herself. She had started to lose her trust in people. but Qing Shui saw a shred of emotion in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang!” Qing Shui called out gently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui. You’re here.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very sad when he heard her voice. It was as if she was a totally different person. She was lonely. In the past, she had a sister. When her sister was around, she was so warm, so homely, and she was not alone in this world.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ignoring her protest, Qing Shui held her hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But Wenren Wushuang used her free hand and hit Qing Shui’s chest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not move. He let her hammer him with one of her fists, but he did not release her other hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Peng Peng Peng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not even use his skills.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A stream of blood flowed from his mouth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why don’t you dodge? Why don’t you use your skills? Why do you let me do this to you..” Wenren Wushuang continued as she started to cry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang, I understand you. You still have me. You still have me.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui did not say it out blankly, she knew that he wanted to convey that he still cared for her, and will not guard against her. She could rely on him and he would do anything for her just as she did.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was leaving and he did not know how long he would need to stay at the Heavenly Palace. He did not wish to see Wenren Wushang cut herself off totally. No matter what, he wanted her to open up to him.&nbsp;</p>
