  <p><strong>AST 180 – Beautiful Chef of the Earthly Paradise beautiful chef, Buddha Jumps over the Wall (Chinese dish)</strong></p>
  <p>“This drink will be for the both of us from now on!” Huoyun Liu-li looked at Qing Shui. Her eyes were filled with a drunk’s gleam, and her alluring pretty mouth curled into a beautiful outline. </p>
  <p>“That’s fine, you can save it for yourself in the future.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
  <p>“Why? Do you not like to drink it?” Huoyun Liu-li looked at Qing Shui, surprised.</p>
  <p>“I want to drink; I really want to, but after I drink it… Look at me! I’m just asking for problems!” Qing Shui looked down at himself bitterly.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-li, confused, followed Qing Shui’s eyes downwards and saw a tall tent. Her charming face turned red as an apple, and she quickly looked away. It was as if a little deer was bumping into her heart, and she didn’t even know what to say.</p>
  <p>“Slurp!” Qing Shui smiled and continued to drink.</p>
  <p>“You are still drinking?” Huoyun Liu-li lifted up her lovable and enchanting face and said shyly, with a hint of annoyance.</p>
  <p>“We can’t waste this, so let’s just finish it!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at her as she finished the Tiger Bone Liquor in her cup and reluctantly licked her lips. Her delicate and pretty face slightly flushed red, emitting a bewitching attractiveness.</p>
  <p>As Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui, her heart couldn’t help but quicken its heartbeat as she said to herself, “This kid is actually really good-looking. Why does my heart beat so much faster when I see him?”</p>
  <p>“Then wouldn’t you feel uncomfortable?” A flushed Huoyun Liu-Li looked hurriedly at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“I just have to bear with it. A man should be hard on himself, and little by little, there would be hope in the future that I could be successful.” Qing Shui chuckled and said. At the same time, he inwardly apprehended the might of this Tiger Bone Liquor. If he was a normal man, he would probably have to settle his problem.</p>
  <p>“You can’t drink anymore.” Huoyun Liu-li protested coquettishly and took Qing Shui’s cup away from him. She accidently saw that exaggerated tent under him again. This made her tender and beautiful face turn a dark red, emitting an exceptionally enchanting poisonous feeling.</p>
  <p>“This liquor is actually not as bad as you think. Although after drinking, the thing down there would swell…really badly. It won’t make me lose my natural instincts, and it won’t make me look for women uncontrollably. This liquor only makes it hard as steel, so you don’t have to worry about it.” Qing Shui smiled, embarrassed.</p>
  <p>“How worried I felt!” Huoyun Liu-li was provoked by Qing Shui’s words and hit Qing Shui’s chest once angrily. His body was boiling when she touched him. His man scent reached her nose, making her enchanting body fall towards Qing Shui. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui subconsciously helped hold her waist, and her alluring and gentle body fell into Qing Shui’s embrace!</p>
  <p>It was as if time stopped. Qing Shui felt the pressure of Huoyun Liu-Li’s full and bouncy breasts, and her feminine scent made him forget everything. The tent below him also pressed against her soft spot, and the stimulation made the tent swell even more.</p>
  <p>The smooth jade body trembled in Qing Shui’s embrace, and her body started burning. Her hands subconsciously wrapped around Qing Shui’s neck, and her cloudy eyes looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Being at such a close distance with her bewitchingly, beautiful face made Qing Shui’s heartbeat quicken. Her delicate, sparkling, and translucent skin exuded an enchanting air that would make a person go crazy. Qing Shui slowly leaned in towards the beautiful curve of her lips to kiss her.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-li’s eyes moved. She turned her head, making Qing Shui kiss her delicate cheek instead of her lips. Her cheek was silky, exquisite, wonderful, and soft with a light feminine fragrance. Qing Shui felt like he was dreaming. </p>
  <p>“Let me go, Qing Shui.” Huoyun Liu-li said shyly but firmly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui let her go reluctantly and said softly, “Sorry, I couldn’t control myself.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew he shouldn’t apologize to her at the moment, but she didn’t want to be too intimate with him. She might not like him, at least not yet. </p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-li also had complicated feelings. It was as if someone spilled different condiments in her heart; she felt sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy all at the same time, and she didn’t know whether to be happy, depressed, or worried about her complicated heart.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you don’t have to apologize. My heart feels confused right now. Do you understand what I’m saying?” A shy Huoyun Liu-li said nervously and bitterly as she stood in front of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Cheer up, don’t feel pressured. I acted on impulse just now, but I can’t help it. I am a man, so if I had no reaction that time, I should be grieving. I’m just sorry that I profaned you, big sister.” Qing Shui extended his hand, wanting to touch her face, but stopped awkwardly midair. </p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-li stepped towards him shyly and pressed her flushed cheek against Qing Shui’s hand. She lowered her head, hoping to not make any direct eye contact with Qing Shui’s soft gaze, but she saw his exaggerated tent again.</p>
  <p>What made her frenetic even more was that the tip of the hard tent was softly pressing against her lower abdomen. Huoyun Liu-li could feel its astonishingly high heat and its slight twitch. </p>
  <p>“Bad thing!”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-li left swiftly, leaving Qing Shui with an awkward smile on his face.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did think he was too impulsive, but it felt comfortable to hug her. It also gave him an amiable feeling, which was even more comfortable than massaging her last time. His hands touched her perky and round butt again, which was pressing on his body forcefully. His tent also forced itself into a soft spot. </p>
  <p>Somehow, there was one more person on the dining table during lunch. She was a beautiful and young woman, and she was like the white snow. The snow white clothing on her exquisite and fine body seemed like it was custom made for her. </p>
  <p>Her body was curvy yet slender and proportionate. Her breasts were big and around, and it seemed like they were about to burst through her clothes. Her eyes were bright and clear, and her smile was like the crescent moon, full of a pretty and flirtatious flavor, which contrasts with her saintly white clothes.</p>
  <p>Like really attracts like. It was another flirtatious and charming woman again; Qing Shui braced himself and walked there.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, this is the most beautiful and talented chef here at Earthly Paradise, Mei Yanxue!” </p>
  <p>“This is Qing Shui, those kinds of fruits were his. Maybe he could help you on culinary arts.” Huoyun Liu-Li and that woman stood up as Huoyun Liu-Li introduced her.</p>
  <p>“Big brother Shui, don’t be selfish. If you know anything, you have to teach little sister.” Her voice was sweet-sounding and crisp, and her snow white skin was still a little rosy, emitting a healthy, ruddy, and youthful feeling.</p>
  <p>Someone finally called him big brother again, and it was a lovely woman. After she stood up, Qing Shui found that Mei Yanxue had the S-line body of a devil.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, I can’t compare with you, a beautiful imperial chef, in terms of culinary arts, but I can give you a few recipes. If you don’t mind, I can write it down and give it to you in a moment.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
  <p>It was a kind of enjoyment to chat with beautiful women. Although Mei Yanxue didn’t have the unordinary and irresistible charm like Huoyun Liu-li, she would definitely be great in bed. It must be really satisfying to do it with her. Her exaggerated body immediately made one think about the bed. </p>
  <p>“Alright, let’s all sit down and eat!” Huoyun Liu-li urged softly.</p>
  <p>This time, the Drunken Fragrance Fruit was not added to the meal, but maybe it was because he was used to it or because this was Mei Yanxue’s best dish, Qing Shui felt the food was really delicious. It was really impressive for a person to reach this level in culinary arts. </p>
  <p>“Big brother Shui, why don’t you give me your recipes? This is really urgent.”</p>
  <p>After the meal, Mei Yanxue said embarrassingly and pulled on Qing Shui’s sleeves as he was about to leave. </p>
  <p>“I was just getting ready to write it for you. You’re so impatient.” Qing Shui said, smiling. </p>
  <p>However, after he commented on her impatience, Mei Yanxue’s snow white oval face turned scarlet. Her eyes turned into crescent moons as she looked at Qing Shui, completely at a loss as to what to do. Her lovable yet silly manner was especially flavorful on this woman with a sexy body.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui finished writing the recipes for roast duck, buddha jumps over the wall, and steamed bun! </p>
  <p>Qing Shui only wrote the recipe for the steamed bun after hesitation. He gave the three recipes to Mei Yanxue, but he didn’t write others like the Bean Offering Fruit. It’s not that he didn’t trust her; after all, she knows Huoyun Liu-li. Qing Shui just felt that it was unnecessary to give everything that he knew to her, especially since they had just met, and he didn’t know whether they would see each other in the future. </p>
  <p>Mei Yanxue’s eyes glowed as she looked at the recipes. She was only interested in cooking, so much that she was almost obsessed with it. If this wasn’t the case, she would not have achieved such a high level of culinary skills at such a young age. </p>
  <p>She could see with one glance how precious these recipes are from her experience, and she also knew the value that they contained. “Big brother Shui, these recipes are so precious.”</p>
  <p>“Hehe, it’s nothing. You are big sister Liu-li’s friend, and you are also the most beautiful and talented chef at Earthly Paradise. I hope that Earthly Paradise will continue to do well in the future, so giving these to you would be the most appropriate.” Qing Shui chuckled as he said. </p>
  <p>Mei Yanxue was also a smart person. Although Qing Shui didn’t directly say it, she understood the meaning behind Qing Shui’s words. Since she was not close with Qing Shui, he only gave such a precious recipe to her because of Huoyun Liu-li.</p>
  <p>“Don’t worry, these will only appear at Earthly Paradise.” Mei Yanxue said as she looked at Qing Shui, and her delicate lips pouted slightly.</p>
  <p>After Mei Yanxue left, only two people, Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-li, remained. Only now did the awkward air slowly lift, provoking a rebuking gaze from Huoyun Liu-li.</p>
  <p>“I need to leave, but I don’t know when I would return. I will probably come back once before the year ends.” Qing Shui calmed down and said softly. </p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-li’s delicate today trembled conspicuously, and she looked at Qing Shui, “Is it because I didn’t let you…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui forced a smile, “Silly girl, what are you thinking about? Why is such a pretty head filled with such hideous things? You need to fill it with more healthy and positive things in the future. Ok? Good girl.”</p>
  <p>As Qing Shui talked, he rubbed Huoyun Liu-li’s head with a little force!</p>
  <p>“I don’t like you; you’re the unhealthy one. Scoundrel, bad thing…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at Huoyun Liu-li, whose only insults seemed to be “bad thing” and “scoundrel,” and felt happy in his heart. He was uncomfortable when he saw her sudden gloomy mood earlier, as if something pricked his heart.</p>
  <p>After he left Earthly Paradise, Qing Shui planned to visit the famous landmark, the Thousand Buddha Grottoes, in the Cang Lang Country. In his past life, he didn’t visit the Thousand Buddha Mountain, so he wanted to visit the one in the world of the nine continents when he had the opportunity.</p>
  <p>All the famous landmarks had excellent feng shui as well as strong spiritual influence. Almost all of the famous landmarks at the Cang Lang Country was accompanied by the presence of sects and old families. </p>
  <p>The famous landmarks such as Skysword Mountain was occupied by the Skysword Sect, the Star Moon Lake had the Star Moon Sect, the Incense Valley had the Incense Valley Sect, the Joyous Forest had the Joyous Forest Sect…</p>

 <p>Qing Shui let her go reluctantly and said softly, “Sorry, I couldn’t control myself.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew he shouldn’t apologize to her at the moment, but she didn’t want to be too intimate with him. She might not like him, at least not yet. </p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-li also had complicated feelings. It was as if someone spilled different condiments in her heart; she felt sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy all at the same time, and she didn’t know whether to be happy, depressed, or worried about her complicated heart.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you don’t have to apologize. My heart feels confused right now. Do you understand what I’m saying?” A shy Huoyun Liu-li said nervously and bitterly as she stood in front of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Cheer up, don’t feel pressured. I acted on impulse just now, but I can’t help it. I am a man, so if I had no reaction that time, I should be grieving. I’m just sorry that I profaned you, big sister.” Qing Shui extended his hand, wanting to touch her face, but stopped awkwardly midair. </p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-li stepped towards him shyly and pressed her flushed cheek against Qing Shui’s hand. She lowered her head, hoping to not make any direct eye contact with Qing Shui’s soft gaze, but she saw his exaggerated tent again.</p>
 <p>What made her frenetic even more was that the tip of the hard tent was softly pressing against her lower abdomen. Huoyun Liu-li could feel its astonishingly high heat and its slight twitch. </p>
 <p>“Bad thing!”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-li left swiftly, leaving Qing Shui with an awkward smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did think he was too impulsive, but it felt comfortable to hug her. It also gave him an amiable feeling, which was even more comfortable than massaging her last time. His hands touched her perky and round butt again, which was pressing on his body forcefully. His tent also forced itself into a soft spot. </p>
 <p>Somehow, there was one more person on the dining table during lunch. She was a beautiful and young woman, and she was like the white snow. The snow white clothing on her exquisite and fine body seemed like it was custom made for her. </p>
 <p>Her body was curvy yet slender and proportionate. Her breasts were big and around, and it seemed like they were about to burst through her clothes. Her eyes were bright and clear, and her smile was like the crescent moon, full of a pretty and flirtatious flavor, which contrasts with her saintly white clothes.</p>
 <p>Like really attracts like. It was another flirtatious and charming woman again; Qing Shui braced himself and walked there.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, this is the most beautiful and talented chef here at Earthly Paradise, Mei Yanxue!” </p>
 <p>“This is Qing Shui, those kinds of fruits were his. Maybe he could help you on culinary arts.” Huoyun Liu-Li and that woman stood up as Huoyun Liu-Li introduced her.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Shui, don’t be selfish. If you know anything, you have to teach little sister.” Her voice was sweet-sounding and crisp, and her snow white skin was still a little rosy, emitting a healthy, ruddy, and youthful feeling.</p>
 <p>Someone finally called him big brother again, and it was a lovely woman. After she stood up, Qing Shui found that Mei Yanxue had the S-line body of a devil.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I can’t compare with you, a beautiful imperial chef, in terms of culinary arts, but I can give you a few recipes. If you don’t mind, I can write it down and give it to you in a moment.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>It was a kind of enjoyment to chat with beautiful women. Although Mei Yanxue didn’t have the unordinary and irresistible charm like Huoyun Liu-li, she would definitely be great in bed. It must be really satisfying to do it with her. Her exaggerated body immediately made one think about the bed. </p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s all sit down and eat!” Huoyun Liu-li urged softly.</p>
 <p>This time, the Drunken Fragrance Fruit was not added to the meal, but maybe it was because he was used to it or because this was Mei Yanxue’s best dish, Qing Shui felt the food was really delicious. It was really impressive for a person to reach this level in culinary arts. </p>
 <p>“Big brother Shui, why don’t you give me your recipes? This is really urgent.”</p>
 <p>After the meal, Mei Yanxue said embarrassingly and pulled on Qing Shui’s sleeves as he was about to leave. </p>
 <p>“I was just getting ready to write it for you. You’re so impatient.” Qing Shui said, smiling. </p>
 <p>However, after he commented on her impatience, Mei Yanxue’s snow white oval face turned scarlet. Her eyes turned into crescent moons as she looked at Qing Shui, completely at a loss as to what to do. Her lovable yet silly manner was especially flavorful on this woman with a sexy body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finished writing the recipes for roast duck, buddha jumps over the wall, and steamed bun! </p>
 <p>Qing Shui only wrote the recipe for the steamed bun after hesitation. He gave the three recipes to Mei Yanxue, but he didn’t write others like the Bean Offering Fruit. It’s not that he didn’t trust her; after all, she knows Huoyun Liu-li. Qing Shui just felt that it was unnecessary to give everything that he knew to her, especially since they had just met, and he didn’t know whether they would see each other in the future. </p>
 <p>Mei Yanxue’s eyes glowed as she looked at the recipes. She was only interested in cooking, so much that she was almost obsessed with it. If this wasn’t the case, she would not have achieved such a high level of culinary skills at such a young age. </p>
 <p>She could see with one glance how precious these recipes are from her experience, and she also knew the value that they contained. “Big brother Shui, these recipes are so precious.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, it’s nothing. You are big sister Liu-li’s friend, and you are also the most beautiful and talented chef at Earthly Paradise. I hope that Earthly Paradise will continue to do well in the future, so giving these to you would be the most appropriate.” Qing Shui chuckled as he said. </p>
 <p>Mei Yanxue was also a smart person. Although Qing Shui didn’t directly say it, she understood the meaning behind Qing Shui’s words. Since she was not close with Qing Shui, he only gave such a precious recipe to her because of Huoyun Liu-li.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, these will only appear at Earthly Paradise.” Mei Yanxue said as she looked at Qing Shui, and her delicate lips pouted slightly.</p>
 <p>After Mei Yanxue left, only two people, Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-li, remained. Only now did the awkward air slowly lift, provoking a rebuking gaze from Huoyun Liu-li.</p>
 <p>“I need to leave, but I don’t know when I would return. I will probably come back once before the year ends.” Qing Shui calmed down and said softly. </p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-li’s delicate today trembled conspicuously, and she looked at Qing Shui, “Is it because I didn’t let you…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui forced a smile, “Silly girl, what are you thinking about? Why is such a pretty head filled with such hideous things? You need to fill it with more healthy and positive things in the future. Ok? Good girl.”</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui talked, he rubbed Huoyun Liu-li’s head with a little force!</p>
 <p>“I don’t like you; you’re the unhealthy one. Scoundrel, bad thing…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at Huoyun Liu-li, whose only insults seemed to be “bad thing” and “scoundrel,” and felt happy in his heart. He was uncomfortable when he saw her sudden gloomy mood earlier, as if something pricked his heart.</p>
 <p>After he left Earthly Paradise, Qing Shui planned to visit the famous landmark, the Thousand Buddha Grottoes, in the Cang Lang Country. In his past life, he didn’t visit the Thousand Buddha Mountain, so he wanted to visit the one in the world of the nine continents when he had the opportunity.</p>
 <p>All the famous landmarks had excellent feng shui as well as strong spiritual influence. Almost all of the famous landmarks at the Cang Lang Country was accompanied by the presence of sects and old families. </p>
 <p>The famous landmarks such as Skysword Mountain was occupied by the Skysword Sect, the Star Moon Lake had the Star Moon Sect, the Incense Valley had the Incense Valley Sect, the Joyous Forest had the Joyous Forest Sect…</p>
