Why would you come up with such a kind of thought?” Qing Shui was hugging her while laying on his side. They were cuddling each other very tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You seem different compared to yesterday.’ Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As time passed, I began to miss you more and more. Why would you start to question your own charm? Do you need me to remind you of our first ti-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not ever speak about it.” Yiye Jiange covered Qing Shui’s mouth. Qing Shui was very naughty. He had even once told her to beg him to take off his clothes. Regardless of that, it still made her felt warm thinking about the things in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright. I will stop talking about it. Here, let me carry you onto the belittled. That little brat looks really lonely, being there all by himself.” Qing Shui carried Yiye Jiange up and together returned to the bed where Qing Xiu was on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t actually make the little brat a baby bed. At night, Yiye Jiange would stay together with the little brat under the same blanket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, Sister Qing Cheng and also Hanye both liked you. Do you like them back?” Yiye Jiange was leaning on a pillow. Her slender body had been covered up by the blanket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We finally got to be with each other right now. Why did you start talking about this? Could you really happen to be that open-hearted?” Qing Shui was also leaning on the same pillow which Yiye Jiange was laying on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am aware that you aren’t mine alone. If I was your only wife, I wouldn’t have been able to satisfy you alone. At the moment, I can’t even muster out a tiny bit of strength with my whole body.” Yiye Jiange shot a glare at Qing Shui in a half-joking and half-serious manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. Any man would want to hear these kinds of stuff, particularly when the words came out from the mouths of women like Yiye Jiange. Any men would find themselves in overwhelming joy. This had once again triggered Qing Shui and caused him to be on his move again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No one would despise beautiful women, especially in the case of capable men. But deep down, I feel really guilty. I feel that you guys have had a hard time because of me. Hence, I figure that it would be best if I just go with the flow. If I really do come across a woman whom I love with all my heart, I will definitely not let her go. For example, you, master. I will never let go of you.” Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange and chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You impudent brat. I already told you before that you mustn’t address me as your master.” Yiye Jiange blushed and glared at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright. Well then, shall I address you as my younger sister instead?” Qing Shui said in a tone which sounded like he was trying to discuss with Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are such a bastard.” Yiye Jiange was speechless. She pushed out her hand and hit him. After the two had fun with each other, Qing Shui once again went onto her. But because this time, their child was next to them, they did it very gently and cautiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At midnight, Qing Shui quietly stood up and left. Yiye Jiange was deep in her slumber. After all, it was not unusual to be more tired after having fun on the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went into the realm as soon as he woke up. For now, his strength was already starting to slowly increase. Hence, he would never let such a good time go to waste. He needed strength. He craved for it. Every day, his strength was increasing. He wasn’t sure about his talent himself, but certainly, it shared a close relationship with his persistence, as well as his hard work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Be it the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal or even his Inheritance Martial Techniques, they were all things which mustn’t be neglected. Despite saying that however, one could still starve to death by merely looking after the Golden Mountain. Hence, Qing Shui had never viewed his talent as something important. Instead, he felt that only his hard work and perseverance has brought upon the most effect to his cultivations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, who came out from the realm, settled down on the balcony to enjoy the peace only available in the morning. At this moment, his heart was very calm and serene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange walked towards him in a snow white pajamas. She hugged Qing Shui from the back and landed a kiss on her cheek, “What are you doing here, daydreaming alone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui reached out his arms, put them around her waist and made her sat down on his laps. He took off the front part of her shirts and began lowering his head to kiss her snow white and bulging snowballs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard… Are you still not content after what happened yesterday… Uhm…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was enjoying the fresh fragrance of her body. The plump and smooth sensation made him felt really comfortable. He then lifted up his head and looked at the already embarrassed beautiful woman while licking his mouth with his own tongue. This action from his caused the otherworldly woman to feel extremely ashamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A week had passed. Shui Yunfeng came all the way down to Sunset Sea King Palace to drink wine with Qing Shui. This time, he came alone. Knowing that Qing Shui had a child, he brought along a jade as a present. It was a warm jade only the size of a figure. However, Qing Shui was able to tell that this tiny jade was a very valuable object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The warm jade mainly served the purpose of warding off evil spirits, resisting poisons as well as warming up the wearer’s body. All in all, it was considered to be formidable. Only children from certain aristocratic clans would possess it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had only been a week. Hence, Qing Shui wasn’t sure of the reason why Shui Yunfeng came to look for him. He smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to come back out after returning for only a week.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have completely stopped myself from having sex, but I find it extremely difficult to hold it. I decided to come and look for you.” Shui Yunfeng said in an upset tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed as soon as he saw Shui Yunfeng’s face. Indeed, it was a very torturing experience for a man to hold it when he was surrounded by beautiful women. Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been the saying ‘burning with sexual desire’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I listened to what you said and stopped completely when I went back this time. Still, I feel it would be best if I hide myself out here for six months. The most I could do is to go and visit them in the six months period and come back.” Shui Yunfeng said in an upset tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I didn’t mean to tell you to stop completely. I have only told you to control the amount of doing it.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Shui Yunfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s best if I stop entirely. I fear that I won’t be able to control it myself once I start. In my entire life, I am very lucky to have met you, brother. No matter what, I will want to appreciate it. If I were to screw this up again, I would have cried to death.” Shui Yunfeng shook his head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, this is up for you to decide. Six months. While it isn’t considered long, it isn’t that short either.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng looked at Qing Shui with a speechless expression. Nevertheless, he has really strong willpower. Because of his previous encounter from before, let alone six months, he would be happy even if he had to wait ten years for him to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng only stayed here for three days before he left. He wanted to go out and visit other places. Before he left, Qing Shui told him that he didn’t need to stop completely. He should only aim to do fewer times. In fact, it would be beneficial for his path to recovery.</span></p>

Everything that you do involves the Five Elements of Yin and Yang. Only when they combine with each other, would everything be reborn. Hence, don’t do things too excessively. Contrary to what you think, it will be better if you do things within an appropriate range. These all depend on you.”</span></p>

To think that it would bring advantage to him instead. Things would be much easier if he only needed to control his amount of having sex. Before he left, he asked Qing Shui one last question, “How could I know if I was controlling the amount?”</span></p>

Not more than three times a day… Even if it meant controlling, even back around the time when he was at his peak, he was unable to do it any more than three times a day.</span></p>

Actually, the part where he was injured wouldn’t actually stop him from doing anything. It was simply for security purpose that Qing Shui told him to control his frequency. Even if he were to do it excessively, the chances of accidents happening were also infinitesimal.</span></p>

She spent her time learning the Formations Combination Attacks with Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange. Qing Shui even taught her the Juxtapose Phoenix. As to whether she could manage to think things through, he no longer cared about it. After all, she would still increase her strength. At the very least, she could still increase up to 10% of her strength.</span></p>

It was just that he rarely ever used it. Because he was experiencing more and more things, his view on different things had also gone through significant changes. It was not easy to live in this world. It was not necessary to view everything so seriously.</span></p>
