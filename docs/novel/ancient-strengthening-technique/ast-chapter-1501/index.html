After all, a man, if suspected, cannot do anything anymore, which makes him really unhappy.</span></p>

He simply said while laughing. “You don’t need any money in your family. You can just eat as much as you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t it stingy, you and the Se Clan, both don’t have any confidence.” Ziche Sha discoursed and stood up.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder if you still will accept it?” said Ziche Sha surprised.</span></p>

Do not say anything which underestimates the other's strength.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the woman looked at him, Qing Shui was left with little to say, so she said: ‘Sophistry.'</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'Well, thank you Miss, but what if it’s not going to help me.' Qing Shui said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, I don't think you are worried at all. It seems that you are certain that you will never lose out even if you have a bad stomach.” Ziche Sha said while having tea with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;The mentality and adaptability of this woman seems to be very strong, and is so fast, she has been able to easily deal with Qing Shui, while restoring her previous graceful bearing</span></p>

In the past, it was said that capable men never lacked good women, but he has only now experienced this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

But in fact, if you think about their position, they have no power. Some people even say that they are small-faced. But they don’t know that being small-faced is also a strength. No matter which aspect is strong, there will never be a shortage of need for women in areas like singing, martial arts, sports...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You own a lot of houses here, can I rent a room in one?" Ziche Sha asked from Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you really going to live here without being afraid of me touching you at night?" Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just pick any one, but I am saying this ahead of time, don’t get any ideas.” Qing Shui happily laughed as he said and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Sha got what Qing Shui was trying to say, but did not say anything, and just smiled</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, Qing Shui as always, did his own things. However, the incidents involving the Imperial Cuisine Hall and the Se Clan were already spreading rapidly. The reputation of the clan was not bad, but it was also not good. At least, it was not comparable to that of the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, many people were accusing the Se Clan. Qing Shui saw this but only smiled and laughed. This was the benefit of the Imperial Cuisine Hall, the people had an unpleasant taste. This was disguised power of&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though these people can't help directly, they can let the Imperial Cuisine Hall stand on the right side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, however, found Nature Energy develops as the power of faith finds a role, that is, the more you support your own people, the more formidable the Nature Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nature Energy was formidable, as you can let your powers go beyond your normal strength, and take the sideline position while resisting the opponent's formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui's Nature Energy Pellet wasn’t complete, but the seven-colored pellet on top of his Nature Energy compared to his Nature Energy Pellet and Nature Energy, it is unknown how powerful his strength would be increased by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is also the reason why Qing Shui decided to go out for life experiences, conveniently gaining some power of faith, though it’s not like it would fade away after all is said and done. After all, if you help people, the other side would be grateful for life</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the world, there are many normal people. Even if it is a bad person, they also have sentiment. You should be good to them. They are the minority. There is also a lot of comprehension that compels or exposes the motivation for the other person to take advantage of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Near noon, when Qing Shui had just arrived at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, he saw that several people were heading towards him, and leading them was a tall and handsome man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mr. Perfect?</span></p>

He felt that this word properly described this man. The man was quite transparent. The smile on his face was very charming. Qing Shui felt that he could not find any faults with this man. He felt this man would be liked by most women</span></p>

The man smiled and said to Qing Shui.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also surprised for a moment, he naturally heard the name of Lan Lingfeng here, but he didn’t feel anything like the past when people worshipped celebrities and the such. Qing Shui seems to have no interest in this regard and it was unlikely that he would worship anyone in this age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and reached his hand out: “Hello, I'm Qing Shui!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holding both hands together, Lan Lingfeng grasped Qing Shui's hand tightly: “I have heard that the attainments of Divine Doctor Qing in martial arts is also very deep. We are all young people here, are you interested in playing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui heard the rumors that the first son of Linhai City was not only measured by looks, but in addition, there was the title of martial arts, coupled with a strong talent, so for a time in the entire younger generation, no one could take over his limelight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not expect this first meeting, yet the second sentence said was about fighting...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng’s bright eyes were surprised. He looked at Qing Shui and asked “Are you afraid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Afraid? I'm not afraid of anything.' Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; “If you don't want to compete with me, I ask you to distance yourself from Miss.Ziche.” Lan Lingfeng smiled, but the words that came out were chilling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood it now, this was his plan for coming. The original reason was for Ziche Sha. In the case that he had properly asked him, Qing Shui would have happily complied, after all, Qing Shui felt before that this man was very good. He also didn’t mind others opinions, but now he was quite disgusted by this Lan Lingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Imperial Cuisine Hall, currently you are unwelcome, I ask you to please leave. You are not welcomed here.' Qing Shui smiled and waved to Lan Lingfeng, like he was shooing a housefly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How dare you? Are you a man? A man solves things the man way. You win, I immediately leave. But if you lose, stop pestering Miss.Ziche from now on.' Lan Ling Feng said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whether I am a man or not, I need not you to tell me. It is not said that a man who shouts more powerfully than another man is better. And, I'm not so bored as to test that with you. I have no time, so don't bother me, leave!” Qing Shui said as he was not at all fond of the young man at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Forget about this soft egg, it is impossible Miss.Ziche is so strongly attached and would fall for this soft egg." Lan Ling said with a biting voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui lifted a silver acupuncture needle and pierced the man’s perineum: Speaking has a price, since you are fond of softness, I will make you soft for life!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man suffered a pinch of pain, then it was all right, but suddenly he felt that there nothing and there was no feeling, as if no such thing happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man panicked, thinking that the other party was a doctor, and doctors could kill without blood spilling, they did not use a knife, but had many ways to make people die, suddenly he broke out in cold sweat: "What did you do to me?" What have you done to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The voice of the man was trembling and fear-stricken, just like an old woman’s...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you do to my friend just now, I ask you to heal him.”</span></p>

Qing shui said with a smile and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Believe it or not, I raze this Imperial Cuisine Hall to the ground." Lan Lingfeng’s voice was cold and bitter. Qing Shui’s outer appearance currently was quite awful. What did Lan Lingfeng suffer to be so angry?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Whatever, I'd like to have the Lan Clan come and meet me, and you Lan Lingfeng to be a porter here." Qing Shui stopped and said quietly.</span></p>
