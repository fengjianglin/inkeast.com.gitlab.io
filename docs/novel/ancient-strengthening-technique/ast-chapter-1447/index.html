He suddenly thought of something, “Your sabre techniques and hidden strength, are these things that old man taught you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm that’s right. She has a very good personality. Will you blame me?” Yan Zhongyue spoke as though he did not know what to say. If he had not lost his memories, there was no way he would marry another woman. Unconsciously, he shifted the topic of the conversation to his current wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, why would I blame you.” An embarrassed smile painted Qing Shui’s face. He was also a man, and not only that, he had tons of wives. In this world, there did not seem to be many males only having a single wife. Even if there were, there would only be one every several hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When the time comes, I will explain everything to your mother.” Yan Zhongyue seemed to feel very conflicted with regards to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, tell me about the matters of Great Yan Dynasty!” Qing Shui knew that Yan Zhongyue had arrived at this place for roughly about forty years. After all, Qing Shui currently was also over forty of age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many dynasties in the Soaring Dragon Continent. But on the surface, there are three that are the strongest. One of these three is none other than the Great Yan Dynasty. The Soaring Dragon Organization is made up of leaders from aristocrat clans and powerful sects. Naturally, there would be many dynasties that received protection from the Soaring Dragon Organization as after all, the Soaring Dragon Organization represented the most powerful organization in the entire Soaring Dragon Continent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t say anything. He knew Yan Zhongyue would continue with his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I became the king of Great Yan Dynasty roughly twenty years ago. It’s a marriage set by the Patriarch of Soaring Dragon Organization and the old man. Now, I only know in hindsight that this move was a scheme by the Patriarch. He wanted to have control over all powers of the Soaring Dragon Continent in his hands.” Yan Zhongyue heaved a long sigh after he said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Patriarch successfully managed to mind plunder, everything would go according to his wishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also silently shock. This old fellow is truly sinister, ruthless and vicious. A truly insidious character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason why the Empress’s clan is left with so few people, is caused by none other than the Patriarch. He did things silently with no one knowing. Only the old ancestor of Great Yan Dynasty had some idea, but there was already no chance to reverse the situation. Hence, he placed all hope on me. He could tell that I’m not an evil villain but sadly, he didn’t expect the Patriarch would have this chess move of mind plundering.” Yan Zhongyue spoke as he stared at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The human heart is treacherous and unpredictable. One might know a person for a long time without understanding his true nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, how’s the strength of the Great Yan Dynasty’s royal clan? There are very little people in the royal clan, I have no idea if they can be controlled. There’s no doubt the Great Yan Dynasty was strong, it’s only a matter if they can be controlled or not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to worry about this. As long as there’s one person remaining in the royal clan, that person would be able to control the situation. The focus of Great Yan Dynasty is very very strong.” Yan Zhongyue spoke in a light tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Yan Zhongyue conversed alot, and he learned that Yan Zhongyue have a total of three children here - two boys and one girl. The girl was the youngest at eighteen years of age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Zhongyue had a fall out with the Soaring Dragon Organization, which meant that the Great Yan Dynasty had enmity with the Soaring Dragon Organization. However, Qing Shui was not afraid. As long as there was someone that could control that immeasurably deep old monster, the Soaring Dragon Organization would no longer be so frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Zhongyue naturally knew this as well. He also did not know how strong exactly the patriarch was exactly, but there was no doubt that he was extremely terrifying. The stronger he was, the higher rate of success of mind plundering. So, that old man had always been in close-door seclusion to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui made the Devil Lord return to her Demon Lord Palace first while he and his father would return to Great Yan and make preparations to go back to the Dancing Phoenix Continent, allowing his family members to reunite. His mom has long arrived at the Dancing Phoenix Dance Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brother, why should we split? We should face all problems together as one. In addition, we are also enemies with the Soaring Dragon Organization.” Hua Rumei instantly stated when she saw Qing Shui asking her to return to the Demon Lord Palace first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all can return first, we won’t enter battle so soon. At that time, I won’t forget to ask for your help. We will soon return to the Dancing Phoenix Continent after a trip to the Great Yan Dynasty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of people bid farewell to Qing Shui and Yan Zhongyue. They were also very shocked to learn that Qing Shui’s father was the Dragon head of the Soaring Dragon Organization. However, they did not ask anything and they understood the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They returned to the Devil Lord Palace. Given their current strength, they could be considered a peak existence in the Soaring Dragon Continent. Qing Shui wasn’t worried about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s not talk about her, let’s go the Great Yan Dynasty and make our preparations first.” Qing Shui’s reasons for heading to Great Yan was simply to see if he could offer any help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great Yan Dynasty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea which grade Great Yan Dynasty belonged to. Was it the fifth? Or the sixth? Or the seventh or the eighth? At that level, it was no longer important to know the grade. In any case, it was a peak existence within a continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Yan Dynasty was flourishing because its location was good. Over here, there were many from Phoenix Dance and Haohan Continent. It could be considered a place where fishes and dragons were mixed together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After arriving at the Great Yan Dynasty, Qing Shui suddenly thought of those words in the tomb. He still didn’t quite understand it, but it was no longer important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Capital City!</span></p>

They used the Nine Continent Steps, hence their speed was quite fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The splendorous and majestic palace was a symbol of the royal clan. There was no one in the dynasty who dared to build a building more majestic and imposing than the royal palace. The area in the surroundings of the royal palace was, in fact, not that well developed. It was quiet instead, with many guards around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flying through the air, they entered the gardens behind the palace. Because the members of royal clan was not that many, they chose to directly reside in the vast gardens. Earlier when he had talked with his father, Qing Shui already knew that the royal clan members did not even exceed twenty. Only the Empress was of the direct line of descent. The others were all too old, and they had no other descendants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for why there were no other descendants, no one was clear. The royal clan of the Great Yan Dynasty grew lesser and lesser, and there were even some who speculated that all this was part of a scheme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they entered, a weak-looking old man appeared. He bowed upon seeing Yan Zhongyue, “Master has returned.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything is fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is the Empress here then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone is present!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Zhongyue brought Qing Shui and headed along the meandering river, walking towards a courtyard by the side. Qing Shui had actually already known that the royal palace was actually a formation when he came here. Not only that, it was an incredibly profound one, somewhat similar to the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation, and was also a trapping formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment they entered the courtyard, they saw a beautiful middle-aged woman walking over. She happily spoke the moment she saw Yan Zhongyue, “Welcome back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, this is?” That woman asked in astonishment as she noticed Qing Shui. There was a striking resemblance between Qing Shui and Yan Zhongyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xin`er, my memories have recovered.” Yan Zhongyue had a bitter smile on his face as he spoke those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman started, after that she stared in a daze at Yan Zhongyue before smiling bitterly, “Congratulations. We said this earlier before, as long as you recover your memories, I won’t stop you if you wish to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned when he heard these words. This was a dignified and incomparably powerful woman, and he could see that she was really in love with Yan Zhongyue. But why would she have said such things? They already had three children together. Could Yan Zhongyue really steel his heart and leave just like this after he had recovered his memories?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you saying? Of course I won’t leave. This young man is my son. Before I lost my memories, I was married and had two children that was a boy and a girl. He is here to search for me and to help me. If not, I wouldn’t even know how I die.” Yan Zhongyue smiled. He then told the story of how Qing Shui recovered his memories as well as the things about the Soaring Dragon Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman initially felt fear upon hearing that, after which she seriously spoke to Qing Shui, “Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior is too polite. Don’t thank me anymore or you might as well be cursing me.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your name is Qing Shui? If you don’t mind, you can call me aunt-mother.” That woman smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, aunt-mother. I hope that we can all become one family together.” Qing Shui knew that since things came to this step, it’s still better to have harmony. It was impossible to give up one side for the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay one family, this is what I want as well. Let me say something impolite, I will treat you just as my son too if you don’t mind.” The woman was also an intelligent person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, I didn’t expect your arrival. I will prepare a meeting gift for you later.” That woman continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is the old man there? Let’s tell him this news earlier, so we can make our preparations early.” Yan Zhongyue spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah he’s here, let’s go there together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about the three little kids? Why don’t I see them?” Yan Zhongyue asked as they moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are all at the old man there cultivating. Now, the old man basically used all his time on the three of them.” The woman explained as she led the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long later, they came to a formation that seemed to be a separate dimension all to itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was much larger than the courtyard they went to earlier, and was even more tranquil. However, there was a sense of mystery in the air. Qing Shui felt very familiar with this kind of atmosphere, yet he couldn’t identify where he felt this before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon feeling the presence of them, that old man slowly turned about. He had a harmonious face and his eyes brightened when he saw Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man!” Yan Zhongyue and that woman bowed to the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their seniority was quite far below this person, hence they referred to him as either old man, or ancestor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, you guys returned. Who is this young man.” The old man tossed the fish bait into the pond nearby as he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After another round of explanation, everything cleared up. The old man started laughing, “Oh the miraculous doctor from the Phoenix Dance Continent should be you, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui accidentally saw a small green dragon tattoo on the arm of the old man. A trace of memories regarding the inheritance of the battle god appeared. He then exclaimed in shock, “Old man, are you a successor of a battle god? The Dragon Sabre Battle God!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui finally recalled that, back then, the inheritance of the battle god had some memories within it. There weren’t a lot of memories, but quite a few still remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s expression changed but recovered instantly. He stared at Qing Shui in shock, “How do you know this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and took out the Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are the successor of the Golden Battle God?” The old man felt even more shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. I finally found another. The wish of the Golden Battle God is to make the once radiant battle gods to regain their glory. I don’t know if I have the capabilities to do that, and to think think that I would find you this swiftly!” Qing Shui was extremely happy.</span></p>
