 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jade Fragrant Restaurant was also on Yushang Street. It was only less than 300 meters away from Qing Shui’s location. It was a dining restaurant, but it was much bigger than the Imperial Cuisine Hall Qing Shui was currently managing. Still, it was relatively smaller than the shops around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, though this Jade Fragrant Restaurant is not very big, it is very popular. Jade Fragrant Restaurant has the best wine in the whole Northern Ice Domain. The food and beverages here can't be traded with money. One must own the jade charm in order to enter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the entrance, Lang Ci took the jade charm out and showed the guard standing at the entrance to Jade Fragrant Restaurant. Then, he led Qing Shui into the restaurant. Those with jade charms could bring people along, but normal jade charms could only bring three persons at most. There were different grades of jade charm, the highest one being able to bring several tens of people. Although the one Lang Ci owned was not the lowest, he could only bring five persons at most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, this jade charm is for you…” Lang Ci sounded heavy-hearted. Entering the Jade Fragrant Restaurant, he held it over to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui waved, “I'm not interested in this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lang Ci quickly took it back, “Thanks, senior! I owned this jade charm by chance. The food here is very delicious. My life would be in deep regrets if I can't eat here again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, a woman was seen coming down the stairs. She smiled, “How do I address you, sir?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui only noticed the woman after listening to this soft tone. She seemed to be around thirty years old in the past life. However, Qing Shui was talking about a kind of matured charm. Her skin was greater than a twenty years old with a matured look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyes were bright with a slight hint of a smile. It was not alluring but pure. There was a clean and noble sense. Her skin was as fair as jade, smooth and flawless. Her dark, shiny hair was tied up in a bun and further enhanced her elegance. Her sexy neck appeared lean. Her nose was tall and her lips were slightly thick and pouty. Yet, that did not affect her appearance. Instead, it complemented her sexy look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark green dress was absolutely enchanting on her slim and tall figure. She was voluptuous but without any undesired bulge. Her breasts were exceptionally huge and her behind was extremely full, which made her waist appear even smaller.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she walked down the stairs, she had an outstanding grace. Her charm was gentle, alluring, and fluctuant with a slight sense of loftiness, weakness, and languid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not expect to meet such a remarkable beauty here. This woman was undoubtedly an extraordinary beauty. She was comparable to the Huoyun Liu-Li. In fact, it could be said that she was even better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, Lady Boss Yu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lady Boss Yu? To Qing Shui’s surprise, the Jade Fragrant Restaurant belonged to this woman. It was hard to manage a restaurant both in the past life or in the Nine Continents. It was even harder to manage it well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman nodded to Lang Ci, looking neither hostile nor friendly. Then, she looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I'm just here for the food. My surname is Qing!” Qing Shui greeted with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mr. Qing, this must be your first time here!” The woman smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea why would this woman block him down, but he nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I shouldn't disturb you anymore. See you when I see you.” The woman realized Qing Shui’s reluctance to continue the conversation. Thus, she smiled at Qing Shui and left. This was the first time she had met a man who didn’t continue the conversation with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, this owner is very mysterious. Rumour has it that she is very strong. Some claimed that she came from a powerful background. Anyway, no one dares to create troubles here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After getting a seat, Lang Ci ordered the popular dish in the restaurant. Qing Shui noticed the price. It was indeed much more costly than a normal meal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lang Ci did not even bother about the price as if it was the most natural thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A quarter of an hour later, the dishes were served. Hot steam was coming out from the dishes. The aroma was strong and refreshing, as if infused into the body. The dishes were served in white, green, and purple jade ceramic plates. They appeared exquisite, delicate, and extremely high class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the portion was small, the taste was wonderful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, he had noticed the fragrance as soon as he stepped into the Jade Fragrant Restaurant. The fragrance was very light at that moment. Qing Shui knew it did not imply a good culinary skill, but a special herb. The cleverest woman could not make a meal without rice. The herbs were the most essential thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of herb was different from Qing Shui’s herbs. First, it was no match in terms of age. The Realm of Violet Jade Immortal had abundant spiritual sense. It could win over this kind of herb easily by its environment, let alone the soil quality and Spiritual Spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have a taste, senior. The dishes are the best of the best. Many people come from far away places to have a meal here.” Lang Ci signaled Qing Shui to have a taste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui complied and took a bite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It tasted really good, and it was similar to his own herb. However, it was much weaker. The dishes at Jade Fragrant Restaurant were very presentable. It enhanced the taste to some extent. After all, the appearance of the dishes was very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm, not bad!” Qing Shui calmly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lang Ci began to feast happily. He ordered another tableful of dishes after finishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not eat much whereas Lang Ci gobbled most of it and leaned against the chair in satisfaction. He sighed with emotion, “ I wonder who could marry the Lady Boss Yu. He would be contented just by being able to enjoy the meal every day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled in response. This must be a foodie as they said in past life. The Lady Boss Yu was an enchanting and beautiful, a one in a million beauty. It was surprising that one could merely enjoy the meal and neglect her beauty. The Confucius had said it correct. The desire for food and sex was a part of human nature. Plus, the food outweighed the sex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they returned to the unopened Imperial Cuisine Hall, it was already late afternoon. Qing Shui planned not to open it today, Thus, he told Lang Ci, “We will officiate it tomorrow. Come and help me then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, no problem! Senior, then, now I will……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do whatever you want to. Just remember to come earlier tomorrow.” Qing Shui waved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lang Ci nodded and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not follow Lang Ci. He did not care if Lang Ci went to Shang Clan. Qing Shui sat in a lounge chair and pondered. He was thinking about his future path. The Imperial Cuisine Hall was equipped with herbs and food, but it was not clashing with the Jade Fragrant Restaurant.</span></p>
