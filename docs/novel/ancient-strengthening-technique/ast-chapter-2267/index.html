 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2267 - Refining Gold Caves and Refining Origin Qi Pills</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bone-corroding Rat Worm was very fast, and even had a small pair of wings, just like a bat’s. It was capable of flying short distances and increasing its running speed. These disgusting rascals were not strong, but very evil and could corrode a strong fighter’s Origin Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui was first getting chased, he was in a very difficult position. He dared not fly up lest he attracted an even stronger being. If that happened, he would be in real danger then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Qing Shui still had the Nine Palace Steps and the Windwhisk Willow, which helped him lose those rascals with less effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was still the Northern Death Demon Mountain where he was being suppressed. If he wasn’t, those Bone Corroding Rat Worms would have been nothing at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui found an open space this time. Seeing that there was nothing around him, Qing Shui went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was too lazy to even pitch his tent. It could wait until he came out of the Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a gigantic piece of Primordial Golden Grizzly meat. Though it was raw, it still had a strong Spiritual Qi with an especially nice smell. Qing Shui was famished and started cooking a piece of bear claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden brown. Qing Shui sprinkled on some spices, salt, and whatnot and continued slow roasting it. Its fragrance grew stronger, as though it could fill the entirety of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. A Bear claw was sought after and a Primordial Gold Grizzly’s claw, even more so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, Qing Shui’s beasts started to gather around. His Dragon Spider, the Dark Phoenix, and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant were all in human form and were attracted by the fragrance. Qing Shui laughed at the looks that they had, and took a bottle of wine. He then laid out a piece of cloth for everyone to sit on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t the first time so everyone had a rapport. Though originally beasts, they were also intelligent. Qing Shui didn’t treat them as beasts but instead, he treated them as partners, as brothers. As the Dragon Spider was relatively young, Qing Shui treated her even more like a younger sister, or even as a daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Dragon Slaying beast couldn’t change forms, but still remained nearby. The bear claw that Qing Shui had was big, but these rascals could eat a lot. The Dragon Slaying beast put a piece of the golden-brown skull beside Qing Shui, a pure piece of Primordial Gold Grizzly skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“Delicious!” The Dragon Spider exclaimed while happily eating away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This bear claw is one of the best things I’ve ever tasted! We can try the other food later,” Qing Shui said as he looked at the Ninth-Grade Divine Chicken and the Mountain Boar Spirit and such, all of which were food treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Qing Shui was done speaking, he picked up the piece of golden-brown bone and revolved his spirit energy. He was surprised to discover an entire mountain dwelling behind him, exactly seven of them. And that wasn’t all. It was even more shocking that all of them were gold and almost exactly identical. Furthermore, each of the dwellings had a golden silhouette.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This silhouette was familiar. It was the Primordial Gold Grizzly’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountain dwellings could cultivate beasts or some inherited war stories. Qing Shui did not know if it was the Primordial Gold Grizzly’s story or a beast. It was like the White Tiger’s Divine Legs in a White Tiger Cave. This was an inherited life battle technique and perhaps, could be called a Heavenly Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two of his caves were golden, both of which belonged to the Thunderous Beast and the Primordial Gold Grizzly Beast respectively. The remaining ones belonged to the Divine Weapon Flying Swords, the Dragon Slaying beast, the Dark Phoenix, and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant as well as the Dragon Spider. However, this was just the start. More suitable ones would replace the previous beings. All of them were temporary except for the Thunderous beast, the Primordial Gold Grizzly, and the Divine Weapon Flying Swords. The rest would be replaced by other suitable strong entities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some beast spirits were more unique where it needed not to be the strongest beast. Taking the Thunderous beast for example, it was a control-type beast. Today, it was even more deserving of the golden cave as there was only one ability that could be put to use from this cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Violet Lightning Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Violet Lightning Strike was different from the Thunderous Beast’s Violet Lightning Strike, as the Thunderous beast’s strike’s attack was not high. Its main use was to numb and make the opponent dizzy. The stun duration was affected by both parties’ abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the Thunderous Beast in Qing Shui’s cave had great attacking power, as well as the ability to make the opponents dizzy. Once again, the duration of dizziness depended on both parties’ power, but the frequency was different. The cave’s Violet Lightning Strike cooldown was not shorter than a moment’s time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then took another look at the Primordial Gold Grizzly’s cave before going into thoughts for a while. The appearance of such a gigantic Primordial Gold Grizzly was just like the real one. Its colossal body with its thick strong limbs, a brilliant golden glow shines from the bear as it roared towards the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flesh possessed the Primordial Bloodline’s power. With that terrifying pair of claws and that enormous chest, not many could go against it. The Primordial bloodline’s power was that it could attack any entity’s existence. Furthermore, it could absorb any attack and turn it into its own Origin Qi, using the battle exchanges to fuel itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The violent Primordial Gold Grizzly only had its own body. As for its special abilities, they were currently unknown and Qing Shui required more enlightenment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most important part of the cave was to use it for oneself. This idea flashed past Qing Shui’s mind but he still could not process it. He thought about it for a long time, and had some progress made, but was still currently unable to process it. He could not stop thinking about it. He felt as though he could think of a better solution in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Slaying beast also grew much stronger; its bloodline had also been reforged. Unfortunately, the ancient demonic fruit had already been used on it so currently there was no way to further improve its bloodline and abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the remaining hearts, Qing Shui did not let the beasts use it. This was because if used on beasts like the Dragon Slaying beast, it would have been a waste. He decided to put it in the treasure basin, including the heart’s Origin Essence Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He then started to train his own newly appeared cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gold Cave Refinement was used once again. This made Qing Shui very excited. He did not expect to be able to see a cave become golden. This made him aware that as long as there was luck, all of them could become golden caves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second time training golden caves was more familiar and successful. It was not long until the training was finished and his power increased once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time Qing Shui further enlightened himself. The dark skies allowed for him to temper himself. Entering the Primordial Gold Grizzly’s grave could also be considered an experience that allowed him to benefit quite a bit, and improve his abilities as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining time was used to refine the Origin Qi pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Origin Qi pill, naturally, was made from the Primordial Gold Grizzly’s heart, Origin Qi pill and blood, as well as its powdered bones. Qing Shui then added the Spring of life, the Flower of life, and the Crystal Physique...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had already refined a few types of Origin Qi pills, but the ingredients this time were the most precious kinds, definitely worthy of being called a treasure pill. It was not inferior to any typical heavenly pill. It was a pill that could also change one’s bloodline and increase one’s power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Origin Qi pills were typically used by beasts and Qing Shui did not dare to try it. The prescription was also meant for beasts. Fortunately, the Primordial Gold Grizzly’s Origin Qi pill was big enough. The power it contained was also sufficient, allowing Qing Shui to be able to refine some Origin Qi pills which were consumable by humans as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, it was almost time to exit. Qing Shui packed up and left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this time in the Realm, he had only been eating Primordial Gold Grizzly meat. This kind of meat was very nourishing, and greatly benefited a training individual. Even if one was not training, it could also increase one’s physique, also bringing about great benefits in the process.</span></p>
