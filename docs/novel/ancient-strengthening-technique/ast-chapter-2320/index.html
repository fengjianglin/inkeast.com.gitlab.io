 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2320 - The Divine Rain Sect Has Come, Golden Robed Old Man</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, both Shen Huang and Beihuang Fan had gotten a lot stronger. Both of them were basically on the same level of strength. Compared to the two ladies', Qing Shui's abilities had also undergone a tremendous change once again. This time around, his attacking prowess had increased by 80%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's current strength was around 190 billion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His defense, 1.9 trillion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda of Defense increased his protection by 20%. Therefore, Qing Shui's defense reached 2.28 trillion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda of Violence and the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda increased his blocking ability by another 190 billion Dao Force, which resulted in the total defense of 2.47 trillion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how much mental preparation Qing Shui had, he was still awed by his current abilities. He didn’t know what he should feel about it. No matter how much hard work he had put in his cultivation, the increments he attained from it was in no way greater than what he gained after having intimate relationships with the ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after some thought, he felt that it made sense. It wasn't that easy to be able to get into an intimate relationship with these two ladies. After a bit of thinking, Qing Shui came to understand the essence of his cultivation. Firstly, the increment of his strength after going through Duo Cultivation with women was also related to his abilities at that exact moment. This was why he experienced such a great upgrade this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secondly, His first Duo Cultivation with each lady would result in the greatest increment. And lastly, it was also related to the ladies' aptitude and talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Huang and Beihuang Fan could also be counted as the ladies of the Portraits of Beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Qing Shui was still very happy about the large increment to his abilities. With his recent strengthening, he felt that the Divine Rain Sect shouldn't pose too much of a problem to him. Nevertheless, he still hoped that the fight wouldn't involve the entire Divine Rain Sect but only the arrogant people at the bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Qing Shui didn't sleep, he didn't get up late. He went to the courtyard and slowly practiced his Taichi Fist, Yu Emperor Fist, and the Berserk Dragon Fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yu Emperor Fist had just reached grade four, and its power had increased by quite a lot. However, the most important aspect of the Yu Emperor Fist would still be its ability to temper the user’s body. It could also raise one's realm, clear meridian channels, and strengthen the bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The prowess of the Berserk Dragon Fist, even Qing Shui found it terrifying. He suppressed the force to be within one meter around him and held onto his Origin Qi. Qing Shui now felt that his attacking prowess when performing the Berserk Dragon Fist had surpassed even Chi Yang's. This had completely made up for the situations where Qing Shui's ordinary attacks were insufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After practicing fist arts, he saw the two ladies walk out to the courtyard. When the two ladies saw each other, they were both stunned for a moment and their faces turned red. They knew what had happened last night. Moreover, the three of them had... Right now, the two ladies were actually closer to each other than actual sisters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui saw the two ladies walk out while holding hands, he felt especially happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their smiles were very beautiful, and their faces still had the lingering glow from the previous night. At this moment, they were so beautiful that it took his breath away. Although the two ladies looked different, there was an indescribable sense of harmony when they stood together, giving off a feeling that they complemented each other. This was the most beautiful scene that Qing Shui had seen in his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Qing Shui was in a daze as he looked at them, the two ladies felt a little embarrassed but very sweet inside. Right now, they looked at Qing Shui differently than before. This was how things were between men and women. Although they did see themselves as his women previously, the feeling was different after they had really become his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The two of you are awake? Why don't you sleep in a little longer? You guys must have been exhausted from last night!" Qing Shui smiled, teasing them as always.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sister, this rascal is too bad. Shall we give him a good beating?" said Beihuang Fan shyly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, the two ladies dashed out toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You aren't allowed to dodge!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You aren't allowed to retaliate!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A series of bangs rang out. Qing Shui didn't move and let the two ladies beat him up. Of course, they didn't bear to use too much strength and only hammered him lightly. It felt just like a massage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, the two of them were embraced by Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I've always felt that it's a little unreal. To think that I can have both of these wonderful ladies," said Qing Shui softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then you must treat us well," answered Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The two of you are my precious babies!" Qing Shui said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mushy!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Babies!" Qing Shui called out the two of them softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Disgusting!" Two ladies giggled, making Qing Shui feel hot. He planted a kiss on each of their cheeks, feeling extremely satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At noon, a group of people wearing Cloudrain attire appeared at Chi Clan's door. When the powerful Origin Qi waves surged, Qing Shui knew that the people from the Divine Rain Sect had come. He just hadn't expected that they would come so quickly after the two men from before had been sent back black and blue, not to mention bloody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui came out, almost all of the Chi Clan's people stood at the door. The formations had already been activated, and Qing Shui walked over to where Chi Yang was. There were many people outside, and the Divine Rain Sect had several hundreds or close to a thousand people. There were even more people from the Eight Desolates City who didn't dare to get close. They merely watched from a distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person at the very front was an old man. Qing Shui recognized a man behind him; he was one of the two who had come the other time. Seeing him trailing behind the old man’s back, Qing Shui knew that this old man would likely be his Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was frowning when he looked at the old man. He was just too ugly! He had triangular eyes and bereaving brows, completely unsightly. But then, the golden Cloudrain attire he wore also showed that his status in the Divine Rain Sect wasn't ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the old man was emitting an extremely violent aura that seemed almost tangible. He looked toward the people from the Chi Clan, "Shi Yan, is it that young man over there?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right, Master!" Shi Yan said respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It has been so many years since someone dared to kill a member of our Divine Rain Sect time and time again. Good, good, good." The old man's voice was a little sharp, and it spread through the entire Eight Desolates City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just from the ability to control his Qi, it was clear that this old man was very terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words weren't just directed toward Qing Shui, but also toward the other people in the Eight Desolates City. At this moment, Qing Shui had already walked out. Chi Yang and the others followed suit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the people from the Divine Rain Sect saw Qing Shui and the others, their gazes seemed as if they were looking at dead people. They weren't the only one with such gazes. The other people from the Eight Desolates City also wore similar gazes. It was one thing for the Chi Clan to come back. It was fine for them to wipe out forces like the She Clan. But why did they have to offend the Divine Rain Sect? The Divine Rain Sect wasn't an existence that the She Clan and the Divine Buddha Sect could be compared to. Weren't they just courting death when offending the Divine Rain Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If others don't offend me, I won't offend them. I only kill people who deserves to be killed." Qing Shui smiled and said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Only kill people who deserves to be killed? You're saying that the people from our Divine Rain Sect deserve to be killed?" The old man said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's no need for you to tag a label on me. The Divine Rain Sect was the one who sent people here to claim a head. It's such a joke. Who are you to be coming to claim someone's head? Do you really think of yourselves as dominators who can decide on people's lives and deaths? Those who make light of other people's lives are all courting death," replied Qing Shui coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You people killed my youngest disciple. Is it wrong to ask for a life in exchange for a life?" The old man looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We don't have any enmities with the Wu Clan, but they took the side of the evildoers to come and kill us. Don't people like these deserve to be killed?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since the feud has been established, are you saying that we should just see whose side’s &nbsp;stronger?" The old man continued to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui slowly said, "No matter what, I have a reason to back me up. A true man must be upright and reasonable. I won't bully the weak, but neither would I give in to the strong." His words emitted intense righteous energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Young man, this world isn't as simple as you think it is. Don't you know that in this world, people are forced to submit to circumstances? Nothing is absolute in this world. Since you want to step into this world, then you have to adapt to the regulations. Survival is the true path. If you are unable to change the rules, then you have to accept. Doing as you wish despite not having any abilities is foolish! You’re courting death!" The old man's triangular eyes shot out a fierce glare.</span></p>
