 <p><strong>AST 1354 - Tianhe Capital City, Tianhe City, Tianhe Renmo&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>A lot of the melodies across the World of the Nine Continents were used either as a subsidiary techniques or a technique to kill opponents. It could cause numbness in the nerves, confuse one’s mind, and also raise one’s battle intention at times. Even normal melodies and dances would have this kind of effect. It was just that its effect was very insignificant. Other than that, it also depended on who was performing it.</p>
 <p>A woman whose beauty could topple over cities could control other people’s mind with just one look. If someone like this was to use the power of melodies, it would be very easy for them to kill people. A naturally charming woman could draw out even more heaven-defying abilities with it.</p>
 <p>The Mysterious Fruits have also been used by Qing Shui to refine some Fate Pills. Halfway through it, Qing Shui consumed a Mysterious Fruit but failed. This was the first time Qing Shui failed and because of it, he felt great soreness in his heart as this fruit was very to gather.</p>
 <p>In terms of refining, he refined his physical body. He cleansed his own body and also performed acupuncture on himself to further reinforce his foundation. He spent his entire time in the realm doing these before coming out.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I am sorry for letting you bear everything alone.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“It’s alright. Now, I don’t feel as exhausted when I do things as before. Have fun and also stay cautious along the way.” Soulsearch said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I will come back before your baby is born.” Soulsearch’s baby was going to come out very soon. Once the baby was born, Soulsearch would be able to get another burden off his mind.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yuan Su rode on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and flew towards the nearby Tianhe Country. After they flew for quite a while, Qing Shui felt that their current speed was a bit slow. He had already wasted a lot his time on the journey.</p>
 <p>“There is a way for it to be faster, but there is a sacrifice you will need to make.” Qing Shui thought for a while and told Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>“Oh, how are you going to speed up?” Yuan Su was confused.</p>
 <p>“I need you to grab my hand tightly. I can arrive in the Tianhe Country by today.” Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure?” Yuan Su looked at Qing Shui. She didn’t understand what he meant and also felt a bit panicked. After she thought for a while, she knew that Qing Shui wasn’t the type of guy who took advantage of others. Thinking up to this point, contrary to her thoughts, she felt a bit disappointed.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Qing Shui retrieved the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su slowly raised up her hands. Qing Shui didn’t hesitate and grabbed both Yuan Su’s hands with his. Her hands were soft and exquisite. They felt as if they don’t have bones inside.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps Effect!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>By the time Yuan Su came back to her senses, she was already in the Tianhe City, the country city of the Tianhe Country.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su’s face was filled with shock as she looked at Qing Shui. To think that such a thing was possible. He traveled such a far distance in an instant. This kind of ability of his should be something that he wasn’t able to use before for a long period of time. Or else, he would have already been able to travel across the nine continents as he pleased.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui no longer needs to grab the other’s hands when he wants to bring them along with his Nine Continents Steps Effect. It was just that, Qing Shui tend to forget about it quite often. However this time, he had actually remembered it but the problem was that he had already said to Yuan Su that they need to hold hands. Additionally, she had also questioned him, so he felt that it would be better if he kept up with the mistake that he made.</p>
 <p>The Tianhe City was similar to the Yehuang City, it was just that their style was different. After all, there was a far distance between them, so there would definitely be some changes to the culture. The only thing which stayed the same was their martial art style.</p>
 <p>All of the places around the nine continents would be under the threat of demonic beasts and wild beasts. Even the most powerful warrior would be threatened by Immortal Demons. Hence, the nine continents had always been about men and demonic beasts fighting for territories. So what if humans were living in cities now? There were still places outside the cities and as well as some other dangerous areas. For example, the ocean. The size of the ocean was significantly bigger compared to the land.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do we have a purpose here?” Yuan Su couldn’t hold herself back to ask. She and Qing Shui were currently walking together, shoulder-to-shoulder along the street.</p>
 <p>“Of course, there is a patient here. I would like to examine him seeing as I am here.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I think I may have forgotten about it. I remember there seemed to be someone from the Tianhe Clan who sent us a letter before. But he seemed like he wasn’t expecting too much as well.” Yuan Su said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Since we are here, let’s head off to the Tianhe Clan and take a look at the situation there!” After they asked someone about the location of the Tianhe Clan, Qing Shui summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and they flew into the direction towards the Tianhe Clan.</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>Tianhe Clan!</p>
 <p>“Hao`Er, have you felt it? That battle intent appeared!”</p>
 <p>A noble, old man in magnificent costume said to a man wearing a Golden Silk Cloth.</p>
 <p>The man seemed really young. But from the resolution in his eyes, it gave him a mature look and it was evident that his true age shouldn’t be too young. There was also a mysterious, elegant aura from his body,</p>
 <p>“I sensed it. Twenty years ago, when this aura first awakened, it skyrocketed all the way to the sky. Back then, this aura was still on the Greencloud Continent. Being separated from such a far distance, it’s only us, the Tianhe Bloodline from the Tianhe Clan, who was capable of sensing it. Who would have thought that after twenty years, this aura had actually made its way to the Dancing Phoenix Continent?”</p>
 <p>The old man was wearing traditional Chinese cloth. He looked really old and wise. The snow white long brows of his helped to add even more wisdom to his look.</p>
 <p>“We are here, let’s go and take a look. I am quite curious.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, grandpa!”</p>
 <p>A splendorous and majestic courtyard appeared in front of Qing Shui. In the middle of the sky, there was an enormous and realistic statue of a white crane. It was almost a few hundred meters large. Its wings were spread out like it was about to soar into the sky.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing these symbols, Qing Shui already knew that this was the Tianhe Clan. It was likely that this was the Statue of Tianhe. From Qing Shui’s perspective, other than looking a bit bigger than a real, white crane, there wasn’t really much of a difference between them.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui was getting near towards the Tianhe Clan, he felt two formidable aura approaching him.</p>
 <p>The old man revealed a shocked expression upon seeing the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant below Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I am from the Imperial Hall.” Qing Shui didn’t speak too much. Instead, he right away told the person about where he came from.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so you are the Miraculous Physician Qing. Indeed, most of the heroes come from the young ones.” The old man quickly smiled and said in a friendly tone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this old man was very good at talking. Despite this, he still smiled and responded, “My name is Qing Shui. You are being too modest.”</p>
 <p>“I am Tianhe Yu, this is my grandson Tianhe Hao.”</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Miraculous Physician Qing!” Tianhe Hao was unable to tell Qing Shui’s depth as he greeted him politely.</p>
 <p>“You are being too modest.”</p>
 <p>Brother, this is a way to address someone. There were also titles like prince and young master. But Qing Shui wasn’t used to addressing people like that. No matter who it was, just like Tianhe Hao. Normally, people who were lower than him in position would either be Prince Hao. As for those who shared almost equal position and also quite a decent relationship with him, they would address him as Young Master Hao. This was something mutual. It was also a more friendly way to address him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the title Miraculous Physician. Besides, it wasn’t really necessary for him to fawn on anyone either, let alone he didn’t actually put the princes and young masters in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, Miraculous Physician, let’s talk about this inside.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned back his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and walked towards Tianhe Clan along with Yuan Su. Prior to this, he only briefly introduced Yuan Su. And Tianhe Hao would also only smile and greet Yuan Su when he saw her. Other than complimenting her, he didn’t really express anymore desire for her. This has helped him to earn himself more respect from Qing Shui. The reason being that there was no way a lecherous person would be able to completely hide his lecherous personality.</p>
 <p>The area covered by Tianhe Clan was very huge. Qing Shui has long before heard that it was a prosperous clan. It had already lived on for a few hundreds of years. Even the Continent’s Capital wouldn’t dare to take them lightly. As a matter of fact, Qing SHui has experienced it himself as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Spiritual Sense was very sharp. At the moment he entered Tianhe Clan, he was already able to sense a lot of powerful aura. The Flame of Life sensed by his Spiritual Sense was very strong and powerful. There were also quite a lot of them as well. Qing Shui was really surprised by it. Just as thought, Tianhe Inheritance was indeed strong.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Physician Qing, please enjoy this cup of tea first. I will come back soon.”</p>
 <p>“Please be at ease, old man.” Qing Shui said formally.</p>
 <p>He felt that both Tianhe Yu and Tianhe Hao were very powerful. However, they didn’t seem to be from the main branch of the Tianhe Clan. They seemed to be not a part of the mainstream clan. This was what his intuitions told him.</p>
 <p>“Hello brother, I wonder who is the one from the Tianhe Clan that needs to be treated?” Qing Shui who had nothing to do came forward and asked Tianhe Hao.</p>
 <p>“The eldest prince of the Tianhe Clan.” Tianhe Hao’s expression seemed a bit weird as he talked up to this point. It was a kind of expression which couldn’t be described in words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He didn’t know why Tianhe Hao would have this kind of expression.</p>
 <p>“What kind of illness does he need to be cured for?”</p>
 <p>At the moment when Tianhe Hao was about to talk, Tianhe Yu and a few elderly men came in. The leading old man wasn’t Tianhe Yu, but kind and pleasant looking old man who looked like a god of longevity. Both of his eyes were smiling and his snow-white brows drooped all the way down to his neck. The plain cloth he wore suited him particularly well.</p>
 <p>“You must be Miraculous Physician Qing!”</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui felt that the Tianhe Clan truly had formidable hands. The leading old man was actually a False God Warrior. The others were all peak Martial Emperor. The Tianhe Clan might be powerful, but there shouldn’t be more than twelve False God Warriors in it.</p>
 <p>However, the amount of peak Martial Emperor warriors came in three digit numbers. These people all had chances of breaking through to False God.</p>
 <p>Did the Yehuang Clan had such formidable forces as well? It wouldn’t be weird for a clan which could conquer an entire country to have this kind of strength. Once he arrived at the Continent’s City, he should be able to see even more powerful forces than here. These people were only a small minority which came from the hundred billions of people outside.</p>
 <p>“I am not so powerful to be called a Miraculous Physician.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>The old man was stunned, and smiled, “Not bad. Here, have a seat and let me share with you the situation with my great-grandson.”</p>
 <p>This old man was a few generations older compared to the other old men in terms of his status in this clan.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qi Deviation!</p>
 <p>After the old man spoke, Qing Shui roughly understood the situation. Not only was there a Qi Deviation, the majority of his meridians were also broken. Many doctors came by but all were equally helpless. Despite searching for even more doctors, they truly didn’t harbor much hope.</p>
 <p>The person who needed treatment was older than Tianhe Hao by a generation. Not only so, he was one of the oldest among them and was known as the strongest genius.</p>
 <p>He was known as Tianhe Renmo. His innate skill was among the strongest in the Tianhe Clan. He still remained as the strongest even in a powerful clan like the Tianhe Clan. From here, it could be seen just how terrifying the innate skill of Tianhe Renmo was.</p>
 <p>The fact that Tianhe Renmo experienced Qi Deviation had made a lot of the people from the Tianhe Clan grieved to the point they spat out blood. It was confirmed that in the future, the achievement of Tianhe Renmo would definitely bring forth a brand new status for the Tianhe Clan.</p>
 <p>Of course, there were also people who wished for Tianhe Renmo’s misfortune. This way, the future Clan Head of the Tianhe Clan wouldn’t be easily determined and each branch would have hope. If Tianhe Renmo was in good condition, the position of Tianhe Clan’s Clan Head would definitely be for him. Even if in the future didn’t become the Clan Head, he would definitely be above that and be the protector of the Tianhe Clan.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo hated evil and people who are evil were his enemies. He had an unyielding personality, he distinguished between good and bad very clearly. Other than the Tianhe Inheritance, he also had a Scarlet Body. Not only so, he had the most powerful Scarlet Body. Of course, Qing Shui only found out about it after he saw it with his own eyes.</p>
 <p>He was in an isolated courtyard when he saw Tianhe Renmo. At that time, he was bathing himself in the sun outside and there was no one else around. He was a mature and very experienced man. Though his meridians had been cut off, he could still live like a normal person.</p>
 <p>Though he had lost his cultivation, the aura that belongs to a strong warrior still lingered around him. He was a tough, firm, and persistent man. Both of his eyes looked very bright, but there was also a bit of pain and loneliness in it.</p>
