 <p><strong>Chapter 65 Night Fragrance Court.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0065 – Night Fragrance Court</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui delivered half a month’s worth of fish over to Yu He Inn. Knowing that Qing Shui lacked money, Yu He directly took out 1,000 taels of silver and paid him. Qing Shui could not help thinking about how much of a young and wealthy entrepreneur she was, as he was filled with admiration.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Damn my granny, earning money is so easy?” Qing Shui rolled his eyes at Yu He, who easily withdrew 1,000 taels of silver without batting an eyelid.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui accepted the money straight with no hesitation. After all, when the 150+ black fishes were sold, the total profits would be 15,000 taels of silver! After the 50/50 split, Qing Shui would still be able to receive 7,500 taels of silver.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Calm, I must be calm!” Qing Shui repeatedly told himself as he took the money and left Yu He Inn.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Elation in his heart, he thought about all the things he could do with the money. He was distracted, and started wandering about aimlessly. When he finally came to his senses, he realized that he was lost. He was right smack in the middle of another luxurious looking street, which was filled with the sounds of people singing and laughing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Especially from a building at the far end of the street, there were a lot of people entering it. Moving closer, Qing Shui could smell the perfumed fragrance of rouge and makeup powder drifting from it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wow, I could even smell it from so far away. Could it be this is a place that sells cosmetic items for the ladies? Let me go in and take a peek. After all from his observations, all the customers that were entering the building were males, young and old. The expressions on their faces… invoked a curiosity in Qing Shui, as he was unable to guess what sort of place that building was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Traces of a smile hung upon his lips as he made his way to the entrance of the building. “Night Fragrance Court” looking at the name of this building, Qing Shui understood.</span></p>
  <p><span style>So this was a brothel. The design was comparable to the Yu He Inn, full of bright colors and filled with beautiful ladies all around. The only difference was, in this place, as long as he had the money, he could fondle the ladies as he wished.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had of course heard of the infamous Night Fragrance Court before. This place was a paradise for men. Every single woman in the Night Fragrance Court, was a ravishing beauty. There were many men who gave positive reviews after trying the “services” offered by this place, and there were even those who would spend a year of their hard-earned savings just for a single night with any one of the beautiful courtesans hailing from here.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Passing by Qing Shui, were men of various ages. For those older men, they were about 50-60, and for those younger ones, about 13-14. At the entrances, were several captivating beauties about 20+ years of age who were beautifully attired, acting as advertisers, flirtatiously pulling customers off the streets, and inciting lust in them as the customers were persuaded to enter.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“This was the custom of the world of the nine continents, even young males of about 13-14 years old would already knew of the matters between man and woman. It was not surprising for those who belonged to the large clans to be able to afford to visit brothels.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stood at the entrance, as an old man walked past him, when a soft voice filled with awe rang out. “Sir you are so powerful in bed, please remember to look for Yan`er next time you are here.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shaking his head, Qing Shui stare dumbly at the old man, could his &nbsp;“weapon” still be erect? </span><i><span style>I wonder if there is viagra in this world.</span></i></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master, why don’t you come in and try our services. We will make you very happy, no matter what kind of play you like, we would accompany you.” A ravishing beauty flirtatiously smiled at him as she invited him in. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could feel an aura that was remarkably different compared to the rest of the ladies from this particular brothel. She looked to be about 26-30 years, and should have been in this line of work for a long time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master? I have become a young master.” Qing Shui wanted to laugh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Could it be that my age is too young?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he pondered.</span><br></p>
  <p><span style>“Men who don’t flirt around are idiots” Urgh, I will just treat it like a form of cultivating my heart. Convincing himself with no effort at all, Qing Shui stepped inside the Night Fragrance Court.</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master, you are so interesting, is this your first time here?” The girl continued leading Qing Shui, as she smiled lightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, how did you know? Is the word “First Time” written on my forehead?” Qing Shui asked with suspicion in his voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hahaha!” Crisp laughter vibrated the girl’s busty chest as a amourous expression filled her face. Her beauty surpassed only by the sunset, her figure full and curvaceous. Especially her butt, what a perky butt, Qing Shui could not help wanting to plant his hands onto it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What a pity that she ended up in a brothel.” Qing Shui silently thought to himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master is really humorous, although the words “First Time” are not written on your forehead, from Young Master’s expression and mannerism, I was able to deduce that it was the first visit for Young Master. Furthermore, if my guess is right, Young Master shouldn’t have tasted any women before. Only virgins would have their heart beat that fast when they are here.” The girl explained, gazing tenderly at Qing Shui, seducing him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui scrutinized this woman closely. Her brows were like a waning moon, with limpid watery eyes, a exquisite nose, and ruby red lips. With light makeup accentuating her beauty. Her figure was tall and lithe, and her age about 26-30.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt somewhat awkward as his virginity was called into question by a random woman on the streets. However, from the conversation they exchanged earlier, Qing Shui could determine that this woman had strong observation skills with powerful analytical ability that were a tier higher than ordinary humans.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Just looking at my expression, you were able to instantly determine that I was a virgin, this is just too disgraceful.” To think that he would get called up for being a virgin the very first time he visited a brothel.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master, there is a difference between those who are virgins and those who are not. The latter, when visiting here, would usually have lascivious expressions on their face as their smiles are filled with lust. As for you, you are different, I have been observing you for a long period of time.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>As they spoke, the girl led Qing Shui into the main hallway. Countless ravishing beauties in their revealing attires decked the entire hallway, some were talking to customers, and some simply reclined comfortably on the chairs. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Young Master, you can take along any of the girls that catch your eye, satisfaction is guaranteed!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui paused, his senses were tingling. At this moment, Qing Shui could feel that the woman before him, was not as simple as she looked. What was she hiding? Could it be that she was the owner of the brothel?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh, if that is so, I want you. Would you be able to satisfy me?”</span></p>
