 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very surprised. He never expected for a Vampiric Demoness to share such features. Compared to the previous ones he ran into, this Vampiric Demoness was like a fairy. As the saying went “Worry not if you didn’t know much about the good, just compare it and you would know which was better”. By merely comparing this demoness to the rest of them, everything had become clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Vampiric Queen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge spoke slowly. After hearing what she said, Qing Shui was surprised. Before this, he only felt that this Vampiric Demoness was a bit different compared to the others. But never had he expected for her to be the Vampiric Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s until now when Qing Shui finally sensed the aura around the Vampiric Demoness. It felt a bit fuzzy, but what truly shocked Qing Shui was his realization that the body of the Vampiric Demoness didn’t emit an intense bloody aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But very soon, Qing Shui began to notice some problems. Though she might not emit a bloody aura, the difference between her and the normal Vampiric Demoness was the food, what she fed on was Blood Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was Blood Essence which she fed on, she wouldn’t need to consume so much of it. She could just take a drop per day, or maybe even a drop every ten days. This was the difference between the Vampiric Queen compared to ordinary ones. Their ability itself was also very different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Demoness, or rather, the Vampiric Queen slowly moved her sight towards Qing Shui. She looked really calm. After that, she spoke slowly, “Why did you break into our territory?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Queen has already possessed a kind of aura which belonged to an emperor since birth. While standing there, her very presence was dominating. This was a kind of pressure bestowed by the Heavenly Dao upon the kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice sounded sweet and at the same time also a bit hoarse. Overall, it sounded quite attractive. Qing Shui found her voice quite pleasant to hear. Merely listening to it was already enjoyable for him. The same also applied to Yiye Jiange, Muyun Qingge, Di Chen and even Tantai Lingyan, who were usually very cold. He also enjoyed their voices. The only difference was only the features.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman’s voice was a bit similar to Tantai Lingyan’s. But maybe because she was the Vampiric Queen, she possessed a charm which words couldn’t describe. It was capable of provoking people’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge’s voice sounded more dignified. It sounded pleasant like the voice of a fairy. The Vampiric Queen’s, on the other hand, leaned more towards alluring and charming. It also sounded quite seductive. With the additional boost given by her cold nature, it helped to raise the level of her charm all the way to its peak. It wasn’t the kind of charm which a prostitute could ever compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Vampiric Demonesses have always been causing a ruckus around this area. Furthermore, they even slaughtered many people without showing any mercy. We are here to obliterate the entire area.” Qing Shui looked at the Vampiric Queen and said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s words had obviously stunned the Vampiric Queen. But it was only for a short while. She carried on and said, “Prior to this, you didn’t kill any of the Vampiric Demonesses who attacked you. This means that you didn’t come to exterminate us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected for the Vampiric Queen to say something like this. Therefore, it could be assumed that the Vampiric Queen's wisdom was just about the same level as a human. He then nodded and said, “We are from the Sacred Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nature selects only the fittest to survive. Since God has included our Vampiric Demoness Tribe in this world, it is also necessary for us to live. Please don’t judge the Vampiric Demoness for feeding on fresh blood, cases where humans ate each other have also existed. They only did it in a different way. In fact, the way they did it may be even more ruthless than ours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected for the Vampiric Queen to start comparing like that. In fact, the true motive of his visit today was never to slaughter the Vampiress Demoness. It was just as she said, be it human, demonic beasts or even the Vampiric Demoness, there had to be reasons for their existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am here to look for the Vampiric Divine Gold.” Qing Shui said straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have it!” Similarly, the Vampiric Queen also didn’t try to hide it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. For a moment, he couldn’t find any words since she was being so honest. It was impossible for him to say things like “Give it to me”, or “I am going to take it away from you”...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I possess quite a decent amount of it. The Vampiric Demonesses across this area are all my people. How about this? let’s make a deal. Are you alright with it?” The Vampiric Queen actually revealed a faint smile while looking at Qing Shui which caused her alluring face to look even more attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, tell me about it.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give me a drop of your Blood Essence. In exchange. I will give you my Vampiric Divine Gold.” The Vampiric Queen said in a straightforward tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned again. He never thought for her to come up with such a condition. Her eyes looked cold yet profound, they possessed a kind of unusual charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know if this woman managed to see through his body physique. But he was certain about one thing. She must have known that he possessed an unusual body physique. That was the only reason why she suggested such a decent condition. The Vampire Queen might be craving for his Blood Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qing Shui came up with a terrifying possibility. It could be, that the Vampiric Queen would give birth to a Vampiric Demoness through his Blood Essence if she wanted. Thinking up to this point, he started to feel a chill across his spine. He didn’t want to have a daughter that was a Vampiric Demoness…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The descendants of the Vampiric Demonesses were all female and the way the Vampiric Queen gave birth was through absorbing the Blood Essence. Hence, this caused Qing Shui to feel hesitant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A drop of Blood Essence shouldn’t be significant enough to cause any damage to your Origin Qi. What’s wrong? Are you feeling reluctant to part with it?” The cold voice of the woman came through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge stood on the side and smiled while looking at Qing Shui. She didn’t talk much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s not the case. It’s just that I have heard some rumors regarding the Vampiric Demonesses and Blood Essence… I think you should know what I am trying to say.” Qing Shui wasn’t specific with what he wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In your dreams. Even if you wanted it, I would never let you have your way.” The facial expression of the Vampiric Demoness seemed a bit unnatural. Her voice sounded a bit high-pitched. Despite that, it was still pleasant to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, with that, I feel more at ease. I promise you.” Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You… What do you mean, you bastard…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In any case, the Vampiric Queen was still someone of high status, she was still a queen to begin with. This man, however, seemed to be disinterested in her. She had never given birth before and was also very young. The man’s words seemed to have hurt her ego.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, don’t worry about it. As long as you give me the Vampiric Divine Gold, I will exchange it with a drop of my Blood Essence.” Qing Shui said in a joking manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I must take it in myself. Otherwise, its effect will be significantly reduced.” The Vampiric &nbsp;Queen shook her head and said.</span></p>

They emitted enchanting auras. Qing Shui peeked at them with his Heavenly Vision Technique. They were indeed Vampiric Divine Gold and were all of decent quality. He received a total of 81 of them. But this didn’t concern Qing Shui as he could refine them to raise their quality to their best.</span></p>

But if that was truly the case, I would have no choice but to accept it. These things aren’t really precious to me. This is my way of repaying you for sparing the life of my people.” The Vampiric Queen was very honest with her words.</span></p>

This caused Qing Shui to feel nervous. But since he already promised her, he has got no choice but to summon up his courage and said, “One drop, just one drop.”</span></p>

She gently walked to Qing Shui’s front. As she did so, a fragrance which words couldn’t describe entered Qing Shui’s nose. It smelled stronger than the ordinary fragrant smell, yet also better than them. If Muyun Qingge’s fragrance resembled the vegetables of exotic delicacies, then the one which the Vampiric Queen possessed, would have been the meats of exotic delicacies.</span></p>

He got unusually excited by it.</span></p>
