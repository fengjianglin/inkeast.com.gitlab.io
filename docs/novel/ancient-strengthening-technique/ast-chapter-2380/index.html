 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2380 - Nalan Qing's Belonging</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was very satisfied now. He was pretty experienced and knew how to get a woman excited. His two hands stroked her back gently. Moreover, he had the Soft-Tendon Hand Technique that was definitely a killer move. The moment he used it, no women would be able to resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it was important that Nalan Qing accepted Qing Shui’s advances. Otherwise, she wouldn't have given Qing Shui the chance to perform the Soft-Tendon Hand Technique. If she couldn't accept Qing Shui, it'd be useless no matter how great Qing Shui's level of expertise was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's hands caused Nalan Qing to tremble. She had never felt so comfortable before. The numbing feeling went straight to her bones, causing her to be unable to hold back her urges. She panted uncontrollably and her mouth had also loosened up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui naturally wouldn't miss out on this chance. His tongue probed deep in and tangled with her tender tongue. He started to suck greedily, releasing slight smacking sounds. This sound seemed to have some kind of magical powers, causing Nalan Qing's body to tremble even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's hand moved slowly. His Soft-Tendon Hand Technique had caused Nalan Qing's bones to turn weak and her hands were wrapped tightly around Qing Shui's neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her perky, extremely round, and beautiful butt trembled when Qing Shui put his hands on it. This was a divinely attractive butt. In the past, Qing Shui only got to sneak glances at it—just by looking at it, even with her clothes on, would make him feel uneasy. It gave him a strong urge to pounce onto it and stroke and kiss it thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, being able to touch it caused Qing Shui's heart to tremble. He couldn't help but grabbed it with some force. Right now, he was still using the Soft-Tendon Hand Technique, causing Nalan Qing to unconsciously cry out. Her voice was like celestial melodies. Qing Shui let go of her lips and admired her great beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her beautiful brows were like crescent moons, and her eyes were like shiny and glittering black gemstones. It was as if they were the moon and stars in the sky. Her snow-white face was covered in a layer of red flush. This was like the strongest aphrodisiac, causing Qing Shui's hand to accelerate. One of his fingers even slid between her buttcheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing's body trembled even more. She buried her face into Qing Shui's arms while her body trembled rhythmically. Her occasional shiver was like the poppies in the wind. Although she tried her best to hold it in, she still let out beautiful cries that were pleasant to Qing Shui's ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's hands continued to glide around, exploring the roundness he could never get enough of. He then put his head next to her ears and asked softly, "Is it comfortable?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing didn't make a sound. She didn't even dare to raise her head after hearing this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had already expected this and his hand continued to probe deeper into her clothes. His hands continued to rest on her beautiful butt which was well-rounded and perky. Her smooth and tender skin felt like the most beautiful piece of jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing let out a soft cry. She wanted to stop Qing Shui's hands but realized that she had no more strength left in her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The direct contact made everything feel even more intense. Right now, Qing Shui wasn't holding back and his protruding front pushed against a soft spot on her body. He could feel the wetness in that part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's hand reached the middle part and a slight smile appeared on his face. Earlier on, he had already probed into her butthole a little, but it was through her clothes. This time, however, there wasn't any obstruction and most importantly, Qing Shui stopped at that sensitive part and his soft touch caused Nalan Qing to tremble once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing raised her head, feeling extremely embarrassed. She had no idea where she managed to summon strength from but she held down Qing Shui's hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't continue to do anything except lifting her up, lowering his head and kissing her. He knew that he should stop before it got inappropriate. They had a lot of time in the future. It wasn't easy to be able to take a step like this today. This woman didn't say that she felt comfortable through the entire thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qing Shui, I'll go and take a bath..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you want me to help you?" Qing Shui wanted to stay with Nalan Qing more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There’s no need..." Nalan Qing quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled and rubbed his nose. That hand touched her earlier on. Such a pure and noble lady like her was clean no matter which part of her body it was. When Nalan Qing saw Qing Shui doing that, her face turned even redder and she started to run away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui only recalled it when he saw Nalan Qing looking at his finger. He was stunned for a moment but didn't think of anything else. Instead, he just found a place to sit down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A short while later, the Water Emperor came. Despite Qing Shui's thick skin, he still felt a little awkward. He was sure that the Water Emperor had no idea what had happened earlier, but the problem was that Nalan Qing had gone to take a bath. What would the Water Emperor think?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Where's Qing`er?" The Water Emperor asked casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"She, uh, went to take a bath..." Qing Shui realized that he couldn't even speak well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Emperor was stunned. At this moment, Nalan Qing walked out. She had changed into clean white clothes. Most importantly, it could be because she had reached orgasm earlier on that her face seemed to be glowing. She was an unrivaled beauty to begin with but now, her changed made it seem as if a drawing of a beauty had come to life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Emperor had enjoyed things like this in his life and after seeing his daughter's appearance, his eyes were wide open as he looked at Qing Shui. However, it quickly turned into a very happy expression and he stood up, saying, "O-oh. I'll leave right away. The two of you can continue. Don't overdo it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's eyes were wide-open while Nalan Qing felt extremely embarrassed as the Water Emperor left. The Water Emperor even closed the door after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're a scoundrel. How am I going to face my father in the future…?" Nalan Qing said gloomily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What's so strange? In the future, after you have your own children, other people would know what you've been through. We're all mature adults and the love between a man and a woman is a sacred thing. Your father has been through this before. Didn't you see that he was very happy?" Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing knew that, but she still felt a little awkward. Moreover, she hadn't actually lost her virginity back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took her hand and said, smiling, "Why don't we consummate today as well?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing's face turned red. She wrapped her hands around Qing Shui's arm and said in a soft tone she rarely used, "I feel nervous. Can we wait a little? I'll only be your woman in this lifetime anyway. In the future, should you not want me anymore, I won't look for other men, either."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sister Qing, even if I didn't want you, I won't reject you. It's just that it'd be a little aggrieved for you." Qing Shui's sexual desire wasn't as strong as it had been earlier on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I know. I don't feel aggrieved. I'll just stay here. When you miss me, you can come and look for me." Nalan Qing smiled and said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll go ask your father for your hand in marriage later on and get our wedding settled before I leave. Is that alright?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll listen to everything you say." Nalan Qing smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qing`er, you have your own views. You're already following what your husband says so fast? Not bad. You still haven't told me if you felt comfortable earlier though." Qing Shui didn't forget to tease her when the opportunity came up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not telling you." Nalan Qing said outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you don't tell me then I'll think that you didn't feel comfortable. I'll then prepare to consummate with you. It's said that consummating feels the most comfortable." Qing Shui blinked and looked at Nalan Qing, saying.</span></p>
