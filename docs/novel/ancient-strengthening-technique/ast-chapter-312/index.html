 <p><strong>Chapter 312 Refining Demons、The Mysterious Demonic Beast Card, Golden Willow Dew.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 312 Refining Demons、The Mysterious Demonic Beast Card, Golden Willow Dew</strong></p>
  <p><span style>"Is it an unintentional act or is it the revelation of his character?" Qing Shui thought to himself. He guessed that it was likely that no one in the Song Clan could fish with this Pure Gold Fishing Rod. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui wondered if he would be able to fish to get pearls, agate, unique stones and mysterious creatures living in the water which could be incorporated in alchemy, with values higher than those thousand-year medicinal herbs.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui walked over to open the 4th box. What appeared before him was a card, which was silvery white color crystals. However, Qing Shui was astonished; it was a card he was familiar with.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Transformation Card!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Why would there be a Transformation Card?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Could this "Transformation Card" be used?" Qing Shui saw that no description was written on it, but there was a vivid drawing of a tiger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui remembered very clearly, "Tiger, after transformation, one would gain strong powers, and speed will be slowed by half."</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, Qing Shui knew that it was impossible to go through transformation. What then would be the use of the "Transformation Card"? The moment Qing Shui touched it, he could feel that there was a mysterious force coming from it. The feeling was similar to that of a treasured stone but yet had obvious differences, too.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui slowly closed the box, keeping a smile on his face throughout. He was actually feeling quite happy now, but just did not express it openly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After he opened the 5th box, Qing Shui broke out into a smile. He knew that 3rd Brother Hei said that Song Clan would give him a gift that he would be satisfied with. And now, 3rd Brother Hei was still looking at him, smiling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was because in the 5th box, there was actually a diamond the size of a fist! </span></p>
  <p><span style>Diamond!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that this kind of stone was considered quite a valuable one, and was one of the strongest and sharpest ores in the world of the nine continents. It was just that he did not know how many years this diamond had been, but just its name alone could show that it was considerably valuable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It seemed like this was the main gift, and the others were only accompanying items. However, what that had made Qing Shui happy was that they did not know that the accompanying items were no less valuable towards Qing Shui, but rather, they were more valuable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui slowly closed it, and looked towards 3rd Brother Hei who was smiling!</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Brother Qing Shui, are you satisfied with these gifts?" 3rd Brother Hei smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Satisfied, very satisfied. Please relay my gratitude to Song Clan." Qing Shui smiled, his tone sincere. After all, everyone was just putting up a show.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Since that's the case, we'll not continue to be a bother!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Leaving the gifts, the others followed 3rd Brother Hei out. Qing Shui did not know what to feel. Song Clan would definitely not leave this as it is. The stronger the clan, the more it was not allowed for the clan to have any shame brought onto them. They currently were helpless against him, so that was why they offered this friendly gesture to show that the Song Clan was magnanimous, in order to leave a good reputation. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"Qing Shui, don't fall for 3rd Brother Hei's honest appearance. I know him very well. He is vicious and calm," Fei Wuji said as he casually smiled, and went back in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled, knowing that Fei Wuji was reminding him. Qing Shui picked up the boxes with the Pure Gold Fishing Rod and the card, while the two ladies helped him to bring the rest to the living room.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"How is it, Qing Shui?" Cang Wuya saw Qing Shui and the two ladies holding the boxes as they came in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Haha, it's still alright. But I wonder what use does this card have?" Qing Shui smiled, opening the box it was in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Haha, this card is also known as Demonic Beast Card. It’s a pity that this is just a normal one, and is of little value," Cang Wuya said with a smile as he looked at the tiger card.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Old Master is aware of this Demonic Beast Card?!" Qing Shui said in surprise. His surprised expression was seen by everyone without any concealment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya looked at Qing Shui for a while before he said, "Although this Demonic Beast Card is a rare item and is extremely valuable, a tiger card like this is quite useless. After using the tiger card, within four hours, it will increase a bit of your attack and ability to break through other's defences. However, the side effect would be that your speed will be slowed down by half, and the Demonic Beast Card will disappear after use."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui gave it some thought. Wasn't this how strengthening effects worked? Could it be that the "Transformation Card" in the world of the nine continents would not allow one to transform, but rather, just add onto one's attributes? Qing Shui felt a bit agitated, knowing full well how strong Transformation Cards were.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Old Master, I wonder where these Demonic Beast Cards came from?" Qing Shui wanted to find out where they came from. After all, some of them would actually come with perverse battle skills.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Some of them came with poison, some with agility, killing techniques, flying ability...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Flying, Qing Shui's blood boiled just thinking about this. It was said that only those who had attained the level of Martial Saint would be able to fly, and it would not be for long.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"The Demonic Beast Cards, is just like what its name says. It comes from the essense of demonic beasts, but it only retains part of it. This card is achieved from refining demonic beasts,” Cang Wuya said and smiled at Qing Shui. He knew what Qing Shui was thinking, but he still explained it for him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"What does refining demonic beasts require? Are there many people who can refine to create such cards?"</span></p>
  <p><span style>"For Refinement Cards, the toughest thing is to get one of the ingredients, Immortal Willow Branch. It's said to be an Immortal Willow which is over eight thousand years, and is also known as Golden Willow Dew. The next thing would be getting a Refining Demon Cauldron and the corpse of a demonic beast. The demonic beast must not have died for over twenty-four hours, and there's a ten percent chance of getting a Demonic Beast Card."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hearing Cang Wuya's words, Qing Shui felt that there were many things in the world of the nine continents which he was familiar with. While the items from the game in his past were only the tip of the iceberg in the world of the nine continents, Qing Shui knew that these were also parts of his valuable experience.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Golden Willow Dew had appeared. Qing Shui was not unfamiliar with this thing. While he had not seen it for real before, each time he came across the drawing of a Golden Willow Dew, it would be accompanied with surprise. It was because the Golden Willow Dew was where mysterious items could be found.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Golden Willow Dew was an Immortal Willow Branch. Qing Shui now knew the basics to how "Refining Demon" works, and that the mysterious powers from refine demonic beasts' corpses could be used to raise his abilities temporarily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Old Master, how do I use this Demonic Beast Card?" Qing Shui realized that he was not aware of the simplest issue yet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"You'll just need to grab onto the card, and then channel in Qi of Xiantian,” Cang Wuya explained to Qing Shui patiently.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Thank you, Old Master. I've learnt a lot today. To think that there are so many amazing things around," Qing Shui said happily and sincerely.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Haha, no need to stand on ceremony. If there's anything you don't understand, feel free to ask me. Things like the Refining Demon Cauldron are uncommon for sale in the Greencloud Continent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"But there's a Refining Demon Sect in Eastern Victory Divine Continent, and it's said that Refining Demon Cauldron came from Refining Demon Sect.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Because of the ample spiritual energy in Eastern Victory Divine Continent, there are many cultivators and they also have the most unique and precious plants. It was also rumored that the Immortal Willow appears on certain mountains in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent with </span><span style>Bell Spirit of Heaven and Earth</span><span style>. It's said that only Refining Demon Sect knows of how to Refining Demon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Even many mysterious items in the most prosperous and strongest Central Continent came from the Eastern Victory Divine Continent."</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Eastern Victory Divine Continent, Refining Demon Sect, Immortal Willow!" Qing Shui captured some useful information, planning to go to these places he had yearned for after his wish was fulfilled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Old Master, are there many of these Demonic Beast Cards in the market?" Qing Shui felt that since Song Clan could gift him with this Demonic Beast Card, it meant that it was not very valuable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Haha, the one you have only has value for collection. While there are not many in the market, there'll be some available. One demonic beast can be used to refine many of such cards, and it doesn't require the Golden Willow Dew."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was stunned. So it can be done even without Golden Willow Dew. It was just that this seemed to be something of the lowest quality!</span></p>
  <p><span style>At night, everyone had dinner together. Qing Shui left many seasonings, condiments and other things for them. After all, he had accumulated quite a lot of them and not much would be required each time. Moreover, they all stayed alone, so the amount Qing Shui left for them was enough for more than ten years. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui left with the few boxes. At first, Qing Shui saw that Huoyun Liu-Li had taken a liking to the red agate and thus had given it to her. However, Canghai Mingyue was around, and none of the items there were suitable for her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Mingyue, I'll forge you a pair of necklaces over the next two days. The things here are really not that useful for you," Qing Shui said awkwardly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I want one, too,” Huoyun Liu-Li said in a coquettish tone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Children who know how to cry really will get milk..."</span></p>
  <p><span style>After promising the two ladies, just as Qing Shui was about to leave, he suddenly remembered that he was still left with over twenty Beast Pills, and he quickly took them out to pass to Canghai Mingyue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"These are Beast Pills. You know what they’re for."</span></p>
  <p><span style>"You managed to concoct it..." The two ladies were well aware that Cang Wuya had said that the success rate for this medicinal pill was very, very low. To think that Qing Shui had succeed in it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>But how would they know that it had been two months since Qing Shui succeeded at it!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Back in his residence, Qing Shui locked the doors and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
  <p><span style>He put down the boxes, and saw that some of the medicinal herbs he had accumulated in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had grown in numbers, especially after Fei Wuji had given him so much at one go the other time. It seemed that the Starmoon Hall was still considered to be quite rich in resources.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Walking over to the pile of boxes, he put down the box with the thousand-year rosa laevigata, and placed the diamond together with the other pieces of Tempered Metallic Essence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He then put that Demonic Beast Card in a separate place, and took out that Pure Gold Fishing Rod. Only then did Qing Shui discover that this Pure Gold Fishing Rod could be fully extended out to nine meters, and had the thickness of a pinky. When it was compacted in the box, it had appeared to be very small.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pure Gold was very heavy, so this fishing rod had weighed about one hundred jin. It had a slight arch, and had great flexibility. Pure Gold was very tough, not losing out even to diamond, but it was not easily broken, and when made into a fishing rod, it could be bent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After extending it out, Qing Shui realized that it actually had a faint fragrance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui picked up the fishing rod and headed to the pond. He then directly put in the silk thread which was over ten-meters long into the pond, looking at the Pure Gold fishing hook in the water. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Very quickly, Qing Shui discovered an amazing scene. The black fishes and turtles did not move at all, but the Golden Medicinal Turtle swam over, but its flinching movements made Qing Shui want to laugh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, what Qing Shui was thinking about the most was that this Pure Gold Fishing Rod seemed to be very attractive to mysterious creatures, just like how normal black fishes and turtles did not react to it. The slight spiritual power on the fishing hook could even chase away normal fishes and turtles...</span></p>
  <p><span style>It got hooked...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui saw the Golden Medicinal Turtle struggling, and unable to escape. Qing Shui pulled it up, knocked on the Golden Medicinal Turtle's "turtle head" twice before throwing it into the water.</span></p>

 <p><span style>"Since that's the case, we'll not continue to be a bother!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leaving the gifts, the others followed 3rd Brother Hei out. Qing Shui did not know what to feel. Song Clan would definitely not leave this as it is. The stronger the clan, the more it was not allowed for the clan to have any shame brought onto them. They currently were helpless against him, so that was why they offered this friendly gesture to show that the Song Clan was magnanimous, in order to leave a good reputation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing Shui, don't fall for 3rd Brother Hei's honest appearance. I know him very well. He is vicious and calm," Fei Wuji said as he casually smiled, and went back in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled, knowing that Fei Wuji was reminding him. Qing Shui picked up the boxes with the Pure Gold Fishing Rod and the card, while the two ladies helped him to bring the rest to the living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How is it, Qing Shui?" Cang Wuya saw Qing Shui and the two ladies holding the boxes as they came in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, it's still alright. But I wonder what use does this card have?" Qing Shui smiled, opening the box it was in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, this card is also known as Demonic Beast Card. It’s a pity that this is just a normal one, and is of little value," Cang Wuya said with a smile as he looked at the tiger card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Old Master is aware of this Demonic Beast Card?!" Qing Shui said in surprise. His surprised expression was seen by everyone without any concealment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Wuya looked at Qing Shui for a while before he said, "Although this Demonic Beast Card is a rare item and is extremely valuable, a tiger card like this is quite useless. After using the tiger card, within four hours, it will increase a bit of your attack and ability to break through other's defences. However, the side effect would be that your speed will be slowed down by half, and the Demonic Beast Card will disappear after use."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui gave it some thought. Wasn't this how strengthening effects worked? Could it be that the "Transformation Card" in the world of the nine continents would not allow one to transform, but rather, just add onto one's attributes? Qing Shui felt a bit agitated, knowing full well how strong Transformation Cards were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Old Master, I wonder where these Demonic Beast Cards came from?" Qing Shui wanted to find out where they came from. After all, some of them would actually come with perverse battle skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of them came with poison, some with agility, killing techniques, flying ability...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flying, Qing Shui's blood boiled just thinking about this. It was said that only those who had attained the level of Martial Saint would be able to fly, and it would not be for long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Demonic Beast Cards, is just like what its name says. It comes from the essense of demonic beasts, but it only retains part of it. This card is achieved from refining demonic beasts,” Cang Wuya said and smiled at Qing Shui. He knew what Qing Shui was thinking, but he still explained it for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What does refining demonic beasts require? Are there many people who can refine to create such cards?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"For Refinement Cards, the toughest thing is to get one of the ingredients, Immortal Willow Branch. It's said to be an Immortal Willow which is over eight thousand years, and is also known as Golden Willow Dew. The next thing would be getting a Refining Demon Cauldron and the corpse of a demonic beast. The demonic beast must not have died for over twenty-four hours, and there's a ten percent chance of getting a Demonic Beast Card."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Cang Wuya's words, Qing Shui felt that there were many things in the world of the nine continents which he was familiar with. While the items from the game in his past were only the tip of the iceberg in the world of the nine continents, Qing Shui knew that these were also parts of his valuable experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden Willow Dew had appeared. Qing Shui was not unfamiliar with this thing. While he had not seen it for real before, each time he came across the drawing of a Golden Willow Dew, it would be accompanied with surprise. It was because the Golden Willow Dew was where mysterious items could be found.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden Willow Dew was an Immortal Willow Branch. Qing Shui now knew the basics to how "Refining Demon" works, and that the mysterious powers from refine demonic beasts' corpses could be used to raise his abilities temporarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Old Master, how do I use this Demonic Beast Card?" Qing Shui realized that he was not aware of the simplest issue yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You'll just need to grab onto the card, and then channel in Qi of Xiantian,” Cang Wuya explained to Qing Shui patiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you, Old Master. I've learnt a lot today. To think that there are so many amazing things around," Qing Shui said happily and sincerely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, no need to stand on ceremony. If there's anything you don't understand, feel free to ask me. Things like the Refining Demon Cauldron are uncommon for sale in the Greencloud Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But there's a Refining Demon Sect in Eastern Victory Divine Continent, and it's said that Refining Demon Cauldron came from Refining Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Because of the ample spiritual energy in Eastern Victory Divine Continent, there are many cultivators and they also have the most unique and precious plants. It was also rumored that the Immortal Willow appears on certain mountains in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent with </span><span style>Bell Spirit of Heaven and Earth</span><span style>. It's said that only Refining Demon Sect knows of how to Refining Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even many mysterious items in the most prosperous and strongest Central Continent came from the Eastern Victory Divine Continent."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eastern Victory Divine Continent, Refining Demon Sect, Immortal Willow!" Qing Shui captured some useful information, planning to go to these places he had yearned for after his wish was fulfilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Old Master, are there many of these Demonic Beast Cards in the market?" Qing Shui felt that since Song Clan could gift him with this Demonic Beast Card, it meant that it was not very valuable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, the one you have only has value for collection. While there are not many in the market, there'll be some available. One demonic beast can be used to refine many of such cards, and it doesn't require the Golden Willow Dew."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was stunned. So it can be done even without Golden Willow Dew. It was just that this seemed to be something of the lowest quality!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At night, everyone had dinner together. Qing Shui left many seasonings, condiments and other things for them. After all, he had accumulated quite a lot of them and not much would be required each time. Moreover, they all stayed alone, so the amount Qing Shui left for them was enough for more than ten years. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui left with the few boxes. At first, Qing Shui saw that Huoyun Liu-Li had taken a liking to the red agate and thus had given it to her. However, Canghai Mingyue was around, and none of the items there were suitable for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mingyue, I'll forge you a pair of necklaces over the next two days. The things here are really not that useful for you," Qing Shui said awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want one, too,” Huoyun Liu-Li said in a coquettish tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Children who know how to cry really will get milk..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After promising the two ladies, just as Qing Shui was about to leave, he suddenly remembered that he was still left with over twenty Beast Pills, and he quickly took them out to pass to Canghai Mingyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"These are Beast Pills. You know what they’re for."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You managed to concoct it..." The two ladies were well aware that Cang Wuya had said that the success rate for this medicinal pill was very, very low. To think that Qing Shui had succeed in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how would they know that it had been two months since Qing Shui succeeded at it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in his residence, Qing Shui locked the doors and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put down the boxes, and saw that some of the medicinal herbs he had accumulated in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had grown in numbers, especially after Fei Wuji had given him so much at one go the other time. It seemed that the Starmoon Hall was still considered to be quite rich in resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking over to the pile of boxes, he put down the box with the thousand-year rosa laevigata, and placed the diamond together with the other pieces of Tempered Metallic Essence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then put that Demonic Beast Card in a separate place, and took out that Pure Gold Fishing Rod. Only then did Qing Shui discover that this Pure Gold Fishing Rod could be fully extended out to nine meters, and had the thickness of a pinky. When it was compacted in the box, it had appeared to be very small.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pure Gold was very heavy, so this fishing rod had weighed about one hundred jin. It had a slight arch, and had great flexibility. Pure Gold was very tough, not losing out even to diamond, but it was not easily broken, and when made into a fishing rod, it could be bent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After extending it out, Qing Shui realized that it actually had a faint fragrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui picked up the fishing rod and headed to the pond. He then directly put in the silk thread which was over ten-meters long into the pond, looking at the Pure Gold fishing hook in the water. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Very quickly, Qing Shui discovered an amazing scene. The black fishes and turtles did not move at all, but the Golden Medicinal Turtle swam over, but its flinching movements made Qing Shui want to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what Qing Shui was thinking about the most was that this Pure Gold Fishing Rod seemed to be very attractive to mysterious creatures, just like how normal black fishes and turtles did not react to it. The slight spiritual power on the fishing hook could even chase away normal fishes and turtles...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It got hooked...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui saw the Golden Medicinal Turtle struggling, and unable to escape. Qing Shui pulled it up, knocked on the Golden Medicinal Turtle's "turtle head" twice before throwing it into the water.</span></p>
