 <p><strong>AST 1231 - Ancient Demonic Fruit, Heavenly and Earthly Treasure</strong></p>
 <p>“He won’t die as long as I don’t let him die. However, he will become crippled at any time unless I help him recover.” Qing Shui explained after hearing Eldest Princess’ words.</p>
 <p>“That person loves his worthless brother dearly. Hence, it won’t be long before he comes to look for you. I’m sure that there will also be others looking for you before that. You must be careful.” The Eldest Princess repeatedly warned Qing Shui before leaving.</p>
 <p>It felt good to have someone care for you. Qing Shui was able to feel that the Eldest Princess’ concern was sincere. Hence, he was very happy. Simply because the concern was sincere. If it wasn’t, it would be useless no matter how much was given.</p>
 <p>After the Eldest Princess left, Qing Shui sat alone in the pavilion. He was pondering about what kind of person the Saint Child was. He didn’t think that he would be the same kind of trash as Fu Yanting. Otherwise, there was no way he would be able to achieve this kind of strength, nor would it be possible for him to make so many people obey him.</p>
 <p>Based on his accomplishments, he was definitely extremely principled. He wouldn’t kill indiscriminately, and wouldn’t be arrogant or bossy. Hedonistic sons of rich parents would just be hedonistic sons of rich parents, unable to achieve great things in life.</p>
 <p>The strength of the Saint Child should be around ten million nimbus. It was definitely not just a baseless claim. However, Qing Shui felt that it should be above said value. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to become a Saint Lord Custodian.</p>
 <p>A strength of ten million nimbus. Qing Shui was confident that he could hold his own against him. It was difficult to say who would win but the probability of him losing was slightly higher. This was because only if the Seal of Roc doubles his attack would he be able to greatly injure the opponent. Of course, once he weakened his opponent, his opponent would only be left with around eight million nimbus of strength.</p>
 <p>If that is the case, as long as the Seal of Roc activates the 20% chance of doubling its strength, he might be able to rapidly dispatch his opponent. After all, attacking with thirteen million nimbus of strength against an opponent with eight million nimbus of strength, it’s very possible to directly defeat the opponent, unless the opponent had an unusually powerful physical body.</p>
 <p>But the probability of it happening wasn’t big. Probability was not something which could be easily predicted.</p>
 <p>Combining his current footwork and his current spirit energy together, Qing Shui felt that he should be able to battle with people with strength of ten millions nimbus.</p>
 <p>Previously, Qing Shui was actually serious about the things he told the Eldest Princess. For example, he wished that she would become a Saint Lord Custodian and even become the head of the Heaven Secrets Academy. Qing Shui really had such a plan. That way, the Heaven Secrets Academy would become his backing.</p>
 <p>As for helping the Heaven Secrets Academy stand at the peak of the World of the Nine Continents, this was still quite a distant dream. However, helping her become a Saint Lord Custodian should pose no problem for Qing Shui. In fact, it wasn’t impossible for him to even help her become the head of Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>Even though some old demons existed within the Heaven Secrets Academy, Qing Shui felt that his strength would rise significantly during this period of time. After the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal ascending to its eighth level, he was the one who received the most benefits.</p>
 <p>At that time, it didn’t matter whether it was Saint Child Band or Lord Sect, they would still be like clay chickens and pottery dogs to him.</p>
 <p>(TL NOTE: Clay chickens and pottery dogs:completely useless people)</p>
 <p>Besides that, there was still Tian Jiange. If he could develop within the Lord Sect, Qing Shui could also come out and lend a hand where necessary. Tian Jiange would play a crucial role in the future if the Eldest Princess really wanted to take over the Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>Other than the Saint Child Band and Lord Sect, there were still many people who could stand up to these two forces in terms of their strength. Similarly, their leaders were also Saint Lord Custodians. They had been constantly fighting among themselves, but still shared quite a decent relationship. After all, none of them were going to leave the Heaven Secrets Academy. Regardless of who took over the academy, they would still have to work together or even continue competing against each other. However, they would still be united when facing external forces.</p>
 <p>The more Qing Shui’s strength increased, the more flaws he could find within himself. Even now, Qing Shui still craved for an increase in his strength once again. He knew that he was asking for too much, but he felt that he had the right to do so.</p>
 <p>Before that person comes looking for him, he wanted to increase his strength and that of his demonic beasts as quickly as possible. He hoped that the things acquired from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal this time could allow both him and his demonic beasts to soar in strength together.</p>
 <p>This time, it could already be considered that he had taken an enormous leap in strength. This was a totally new starting point for him. He was going to start paving a way for his own development in the future. Hence, he was also feeling really relaxed now.</p>
 <p>The little girl returned after the Eldest Princess left. She sat opposite Qing Shui. Normally, as long as Qing Shui didn’t speak, she would remain silent.</p>
 <p>“Lass, what do you want to say?” Qing Shui asked Qing Sha with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I’m wondering who is more beautiful, Master’s wife or her.” Even though the little girl now addressed Qing Shui as her father, she was used to calling Yu Ruyan her master’s wife.</p>
 <p>“Is there a need to compare such things?” Qing Shui looked at her, confused.</p>
 <p>“Of course. Daddy, don’t you want to feel proud for having a beautiful wife?”</p>
 <p>“Lass, do you think a person who looks beautiful on the outside but possesses the heart of a scorpion pretty?” Qing Shui smiled and asked. He wasn’t describing anyone in particular, only wanting to teach her more stuff.</p>
 <p>“Absolutely not!” Qing Sha answered after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Actually, the beauty of a woman isn’t just her looks. A person’s physical appearance will fade away with the passage of time. However, as for one’s temperament and inner beauty will instead increase with age. It’s just like alcohol, as time passes, it will be more fragrant.” Qing Shui smiled. The reason he told her all of this was actually to brush aside this topic.</p>
 <p>“I understand now. It’s just like some very old men and women. Even though they’re old, they are still extremely attractive. Is Daddy talking about people like them?” Qing Sha seemed to be really interested.</p>
 <p>“I guess so!” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Then does Daddy think she has a better temperament or Master’s wife has a better temperament?”Qing Sha continued asking. She would only discuss these matters with Qing Shui. At the same time, Qing Shui couldn’t choose to not answer her questions as he didn’t want to destroy her enthusiasm. He didn’t hope that this daughter of his would stay reserved all her life.</p>
 <p>“Temperament cannot be said to be good or bad. It is simply whether you like it or not.” Qing Shui answered with a smile.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At around 11pm, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He naturally still left the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant outside. Currently, he wanted to let his demonic beasts consume the Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Ancient Demonic Fruit he had plucked the other day. Looking at its bright and glistening form, there was also a powerful spiritual fluctuation emitting from it. Compared to the Hallow Fruit, this was a lot stronger. As he thought about the Spring of Life, he suddenly remembered the Golden Ni Lion which he had sealed previously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly remembered something. He then proceeded to put his attention on the Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the Fire Bird guarding the Nirvanic Fruit every day. Sometimes, it would let out a few chirps, seeming somewhat impatient. At first, Qing Shui didn’t really pay attention to it. But now, he suddenly thought about something.</p>
 <p>He communicated with the Fire Bird, he realized that the Nirvanic Fruit had ripened. However, it was unable to absorb it with its current strength. If it was to consume it now, its body would immediately burst unless it underwent Nirvana Rebirth.</p>
 <p>The Spring of Life should also be usable by the demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly remembered. Previously, he was scared that the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant would once again break through. Therefore, he didn’t consider this previously. Now that he had absorbed the additional strength, he looked forward for the dragon elephant to break through once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a faint feeling that everything seemed to be arranged by the heavens. All of these happenings hadn’t only allowed his strength to break through tremendously, they also aided his demonic beasts in doing the same. If the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was to break through once again, he would be able to take yet another huge leap within a short period of time. Could this be the opportunity for him to break through to the Eighth Heavenly Layer?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called the Fire Bird over, before taking out a drop of the Spring of Life. From his conversation with the Fire Bird, he found out that the Spring of Life similarly had huge benefits to demonic beasts as well. However, even demonic beasts had their own principles. Most tamed demonic beasts wouldn’t actively ask their owners for things. That was why the Fire Bird didn’t communicate with Qing Shui despite it not being able to absorb the Nirvanic Fruit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first made the Fire Bird take a drop of the Spring of Life before taking out the Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>Of course, Qing Shui first asked if it was able to absorb it. Demonic beasts were very sensitive towards this kind of demonic fruit. There were very few cases of demonic beasts being overwhelmed by heavenly and earthly treasures to the point of dying. Of course, this was also related to the strength of the demonic beast’s physical body. Demonic beasts were born with physical bodies that were many times more powerful than men.</p>
 <p>Finally, the Fire Bird swallowed the Ancient Demonic Fruit. Although the Ancient Demonic Fruit possessed tremendous energy, it was nothing compared to the Nirvanic Fruit.</p>
 <p>After consuming the Ancient Demonic Fruit, the Fire Bird flew into the sky and started flapping its wings. The Fire Bird looked really mighty and godly. It was just that its originally fiery red feathers had now begun to turn jet-black. Qing Shui didn’t feel much about that. It didn’t really matter what color it was, strength was the most important thing.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The chirping noises of the Fire Bird could constantly be heard in the sky. Furthermore, the spiritual qi across its body had also begun to rise slowly. Very quickly, clumps of flames started burning on its body. The intensity of the flame was getting stronger and stronger. In just fifteen minutes, the body of the Fire Bird as well as the surroundings were all already covered in a sea of fire.</p>
 <p>Ming...</p>
 <p>The chirping noise of the Fire Bird had begun to sound more and more reverberating. The flame enveloping its body was also starting to turn from red to black.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was actually feeling worried. This Fire Bird was a demonic beast given to him by the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and was different from those fish. Unfortunately, he couldn’t interrupt it now and could only wait patiently.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui currently felt that time was passing very slowly.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>There was a reverberating chirping noise. The flame in the surroundings disappeared. However, the flames on the Fire bird’s body erupted a hundred meters in height, the black flames soaring into the sky like waves of clouds.</p>
 <p>It succeeded!</p>
 <p>Other than feeling happy, Qing Shui was also excited. He wanted to see how much the Ancient Demonic Fruit could increase the strength of the demonic beasts. What kind of changes would it bring to the demonic beasts?</p>
 <p>Originally, the raw strength of the Fire Bird had already increased quite a lot lately. However, compared to the present Qing Shui and Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the difference in strength was still too big. Under the effects of the Spring of Life and Ancient Demonic Fruit, its strength now reached nine thousand nimbus.</p>
 <p>Even though the increase wasn’t as much as when the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant fused with the Fire Dragon, this was already considered an earth-shattering change. Despite the changes not being as significant as the dragon elephant, Qing Shui had still yet to use the Nirvanic Fruit. Judging by how much the Fire Bird loved the Nirvanic Fruit, Qing Shui could already tell that the Nirvanic Fruit was definitely a lot more powerful than the Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Demonic Fruit was indeed a heaven-defying existence. Unfortunately, only demonic beasts were allowed to take it.</p>
 <p>The raw strength of the Fire bird was currently nine thousand nimbus. Qing Shui felt the aura being emitted by the Fire Bird and knew that its battle techniques must have changed greatly.</p>
 <p>Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens, passive battle technique, zero consumption. Permanently increase raw strength ten fold. The consumption of all battle techniques performed would be halved.</p>
 <p>Superior Flight: Unique flight ability owned only by the Fire Bird. Its speed and endurance is incomparable. It was considered one of the top skills among the flying type demonic beasts. It could fly at high speed for a long period of time.</p>
 <p>Hell’s Inferno: The Fire Bird activates a powerful flame attack. The jet-black flame is capable of burning everything and possesses formidable destructive capabilities. Legend has it that it was the powerful battle technique owned by Black Phoenix.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens: Passive battle technique, permanently increase flame attacks by four fold. The damage received would be decreased by several fold. Zero consumption.</p>
 <p>Reading up to this point, Qing Shui smiled. The Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens had turned into a passive battle technique. It wouldn’t consume his own strength. Furthermore, the flame attacks had also gone up from the original three fold increase to a four fold increase.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Nirvana: When the Fire Bird suffers critical injuries, there is a 30% chance it could go through Firebath Rebirth. Once it is successfully reborn, it will transform once and its strength will increase by one fold.</p>
