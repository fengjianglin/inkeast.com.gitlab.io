 <p><strong>AST 1235 - Tian Jiange's Decision, Saint Child Invitation, Rejection</strong></p>
 <p>Because the Golden Ni Lion had used the low grade Sacred Beast Pill, it was now considered Qing Sha's tamed beast now. The huge Golden Ni Lion affectionately circled around Qing Sha.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha happily reached out with her hand to touch its head. Demonic beasts which were this strong all had scale like fur.</p>
 <p>"Thank you father!" Qing Shui turned back to look at Qing Shui as happily said.</p>
 <p>"Silly lass. Is there a need to stand on ceremony with father? Come, let's go have our meal." Seeing that Qing Sha was happy, Qing Shui felt happy as well. Happiness was something which could be spread around.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave Qing Sha some medicinal pills meant for demonic beasts as well as the crimson pellet in the Nine-Headed Moon Wolf's core. This was something good and it could be used to improve the demonic beast's bloodline. It would be extremely helpful for the time when the demonic beast went through a blood awakening.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When it was close to noon, Tian Jiange came by. When he saw Qing Shui, he was very happy. After a few polite exchange, he went straight to the point. "My elder brother has gone to meet with Saint Child. The latter wants to have a talk with you."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this day would happen, but he hadn't expected it to come so quickly. He had initially thought that the Saint Child would only come to look for him after some time. He hadn't expected that the Saint Child would directly say that he wanted to meet him.</p>
 <p>"Oh? He wants to meet me? Then let him come here then." Qing Shui said without a care. Right now, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had already become stronger and even if Qing Shui had to fight with the Saint Child, it might prove to be useful.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange's eyes lit up, "He wants you to meet him at his place."</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange smiled after saying this. His smile had an indescribable emotion, as if he felt a little helpless.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, what's wrong?" When Qing Shui saw Tian Jiange's expression, he knew that the latter must definitely be feeling helpless.</p>
 <p>"Saint Child had wanted to get someone to come. I got my elder brother to go look for him, and he promised to do so. However, Saint Child wants you to go look for him and for you to treat his brother.</p>
 <p>"Brother, are you afraid of Saint Child and Saint Child Band?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>"I'm not afraid. No matter how arrogant the Saint Child Band is, they wouldn't dare to do anything to me. It'll be fine if there are no life-threatening situations between us. However, it's different for you. Moreover, you let Fu Yanting's life be threatened. If you don't treat him, that person won't let you off. No one would be able to hold him back either." Tian Jiange said helplessly.</p>
 <p>"Brother, did you elder brother tell you this?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"That's right. it's because my brother knows well what kind of a person Saint Child is. Qing Shui, listen to me for once. Right now, we don't have sufficient powers to go against that person. Even my elder brother would only be able to be on the receiving end."</p>
 <p>"Brother, you still haven’t walked out of those shackles that bind you down. If you don't get rid of them, you'll never be able to break through the barriers. You'll just be like a frog in the well, and the well would be the shackles that tie you down." Qing Shui sighed and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could understand Tian Jiange's view. He had similar views previously. If he hadn't gained the ancient legacy, he would submit to his fate as well and would feel that there would be some people who were unsurpassable existences. However, it was different now. He wasn't afraid of anyone. He just needed time.</p>
 <p>"I understand that but the gap between them and I is far too big. I'm just afraid that something will happen to you. Maybe we should just bear with it a little longer?" Tian Jiange said helplessly.</p>
 <p>"I know you're saying this for my own good. However, for cultivators, there are somethings which we cannot shrink back on. Brother, I hope you can get rid of these shackles. Otherwise, in your future cultivation, you'll end up restricting yourself one day. You must push forth even when there's difficulty. Otherwise, when you come across a bottleneck in the future, you'll lose the determination to break through that bottleneck. Your subconscious would feel that you won't be able to break through it. It's just like asking you right now if you feel you can attain a breakthrough to the False God realm." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was testing him. If Tian Jiange couldn't even get past this stage, it would probably be difficult for him to even become a Grade Five State Master in the future.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange's brows knitted tightly. The impression that his elder brother gave him was far too powerful. How could he face someone whom even his elder brother had reservations for? Although he understood what Qing Shui said, it was very hard to put into practice. This was akin to an ordinary person facing against a group of tigers and lions. How was the person supposed to fight?</p>
 <p>"If a person wishes to become strong, he must have a strong heart." Qing Shui continued.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange's frown became even deeper and there was a fierce struggle in his bright eyes. His elder brother was a very powerful and since a young age he had left an unsurpassable impression on him that was very hard to remove. How could it be so simple to be forcibly removing it now?</p>
 <p>"Brother, I have my trust in you. This time around, I'll face it with you together." After a very long time, Tian Jiange spoke with certainty. Although it was a little rough, his tone was still very determined.</p>
 <p>"Alright. Don't worry, it'll be fine. In the future, you'll learn how right your decision today is." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>It was better to strike the metal when it was hot. In order to let Tian Jiange gain faith in his abilities, he gave him a drop of the Spring of Life. He knew that Tian Jiange's character could be trusted and thus he wasn't afraid that the latter would betray him. Moreover, Qing Shui wasn't afraid either. He was actually helping Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had gained a tremendous benefit from the Nine Heavens Golden Pellet that Tian Jiange had given him. Therefore, Qing Shui willingly shared with Tian Jiange some of his own things.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Tian Jiange was his friend. In the future, they could help each other out. When the time comes, Tian Jiange could become a leader of an area and he could bring Qing Shui a lot of help. Qing Shui liked Tian Jiange's character. He was a person with principles, righteousness, and he values relationships.</p>
 <p>After Tian Jiange took the Spring of Life, his strength, the of his functions body and his potential all improved tremendously. He looked at Qing Shui in surprise. He had already gotten a lot of benefits from Qing Shui. Could a person who had so many Heavenly and Earthly treasures come from an ordinary background? He trusted Qing Shui as well. Otherwise, he wouldn't have made the decision he just did.</p>
 <p>He had a strange feeling that there was nothing which Qing Shui couldn't accomplish.</p>
 <p>"Brother, if I were to not go, would that Saint Child come personally?" Right now, Qing Shui was together with Tian Jiange, next to the pond in the courtyard. He looked at the fishes in the pond and asked.</p>
 <p>"He should. Although Fu Yanting is a little arrogant, the Saint Child still dotes on him." Tian Jiange said with certainty.</p>
 <p>"Then how many days at most do you think it'll take before he comes to look for me?"</p>
 <p>"Three days. Since he has already made his stand clear, he will come to look for you in at most three days if you don't go and look for him." Tian Jiange knew of the Saint Child's habits. Usually, when the Saint Child had to look for the other person himself, the latter would not end up with good consequences.</p>
 <p>"What kind of a person is Saint Child?" Qing Shui was very curious.</p>
 <p>"Decisive, resolute, does not fear rumors, intelligent, and can be considered to be an important character. It's not strange even if he were to go on an occasional killing rampage. He is considered to be a person who can undertake responsibilities and is always above board. He won't stoop down to use tricks. It might be because most of the time, the opponent isn't worth it for him to resort to trickeries." Tian Jiange gave his assessment of Saint Child.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't find any of his assessments to be strange. If Saint Child wasn't someone like that, he wouldn't have gotten to his current position. Therefore, he had his answers. He merely wanted to know what kind of person the Saint Child was like if he would resort to underhanded methods. Since he was an above board person, it was fine. Of course, he would still have to be on his guard.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange left. Qing Shui hoped that when Saint Child comes, Tian Jiange would come as well. Three days... Although Tian Jiange said that it would be three days at most, Qing Shui knew that Saint Child would definitely come after three days.</p>
 <p>In three days, he might have to fight it out with the Saint Child, he might not. It would depend on the situation then. However, Qing Shui felt a faint yearning for there to be a battle.</p>
 <p>He just didn't know if he could have some peace in these three days.</p>
 <p>The things that happened in the past few days felt very surreal to Qing Shui. After all, the changes were too tremendous. However, this was something good. He was blown over by happiness.</p>
 <p>At noon of the next day, countless human figures appeared in the distant sky.</p>
 <p>The previous day had passed by peacefully. Today, Qing Shui causally gave guidance to Qing Sha in the courtyard. Therefore, he had noticed the disturbances from afar very quickly.</p>
 <p>Have they come?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted his head and looked into the distance. People who could fly like this in the Heaven Secrets Academy would at least have the status of an Elder. Elder Tianyi had come by before, so this time around, the ones who came must definitely be more powerful than Elder Tianyi.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, four old men stopped and stood in the air above the manor.</p>
 <p>"You must be Mister Qing. We're here to pick you up. The Saint Child doesn't have much time on his hands and thus have gotten the few of us to pick you up." The old man in the lead had a strong figure and the golden armor he wore made him appear to be like a battle god. The old man didn't look very old. The lines on his face made him look very strong and there were only faint wrinkles. His eyes were sharp like blades.</p>
 <p>"I've said it before. If he wishes to see me, he can come personally. Since he's so busy, then I shan't disturb him either."</p>
 <p>"You really think very highly of yourself. Who are you to get Saint Child to come and find you personally?" The old man felt an indescribable fury but his tone was full of contempt.</p>
 <p>"Then what rights do you have to be blabbering away before me?" Right now, Qing Shui didn't give a care for the other party's status as an Elder.</p>
 <p>It was because the old man was representing Saint Child right now, and not the Heaven Secrets Academy. Moreover, if it got reported to the Heaven Secrets Academy that an Elder wasn't even able to deal with a young disciple, this Elder would be completely humiliated and it would be hard for him to go carry himself in the future.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui retorted in disdain as well. Moreover, the Heaven Secrets Academy would be too busy to deal with a trifling issue like this.</p>
 <p>"Arrogant. Youngsters don't know how big the world is out there. You really think that you're unrivaled just because you've defeated Tianyi? Let me tell you, this is the Heaven Secrets Academy. It's no place for you to act so presumptuously. You still have a long way to go." The old man was so angry that he broke out into a laugh and said.</p>
 <p>"Old man, I'm young and arrogant but you're an old fool. Do you think that I don't have some tricks up my sleeves when I dare to speak to you like this?" Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>The old man was stunned for a moment. He looked at Qing Shui seriously and said, "Today, you'll have to come no matter what." The old man said forcefully before pouncing toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>In consideration of Qing Sha, Qing Shui dashed up into mid-air at an incredulous speed as he used the Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>Taichi Slash!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spun his right hand and then his palm attack turned from a spin to a hack!</p>
 <p>Taichi Golden Chi!</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had brought the profoundness of Taichi to a great level of mastery. This slash was no longer considered to be Taichi but was just using the stance of Taichi to strike with a fierce force and essence.</p>
 <p>At Qing Shui's level in the martial parts, he no longer restrained himself on fixed stances but rather, whatever he used would be a stance. However, there would still be the shadows of other attacks. For example, Qing Shui's Taichi Slash came from Taichi and exuded a strong feeling of the technique.</p>
