 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan felt Qing Shui looking at her in surprise before stopping abruptly. She then looked at Qing Shui and asked, puzzled, "Why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his nose and asked in return, "Do you have someone you like?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because when he saw her earlier expression, he knew that she was talking about herself. Therefore, Qing Shui was certain that this woman had someone she liked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No, no I don’t..." Yu Xixuan said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hehe, there's no need to deny it. You said it earlier that you'll talk about your own experience. Then, it means that you should have someone you like."Qing Shui was certain that Yu Xixuan had someone she liked, but he just had no idea who it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Rubbish. Aren’t you just imagining things?" Yu Xixuan seemed to have calmed down and grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that she was doing this on purpose. This woman was actually very shy but was trying to conceal herself. Although she would dare to tease him, this woman was actually a virgin. Qing Shui didn't say things outright, but it was rare to see that she would also feel embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, alright, we'll just take it that you had thought a lot about that. If you have someone you like and want to confess, you can tell me and I'll support you. I'll definitely make it so that you become happy. Our Xuanxuan is a great beauty and it'll be the person's fortune to be liked by you." Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan was moved by Qing Shui’s words. After very long, she nodded, "Alright!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her tone sounded a little stiff and her expression wasn't fantastic either. Qing Shui felt that this was a little strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh, right, Qing Shui. The reason I came is to tell you a piece of news. Someone in the Ji Clan of the Northern Blue Domain's Northern Blue City is sick. It seems that they are treating this very seriously and are trying to seek treatment for the person urgently. They claim that they'll give great thanks to the person who can treat the person." Yu Xixuan looked at Qing Shui and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew of the Northern Blue City. It was the strongest city in the Northern Blue Domain and was bigger than the Azure Rainbow City by at least a factor of ten. In the Northern Blue Domain, there were cities of different sizes and levels of prosperity. The Northern Blue City and the Azure Rainbow City were two extremes. One was the strongest city in the Northern Blue Domain while the other was the weakest one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is the Ji Clan very strong?" Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"They are. They are considered one of the five great influences in the Northern Blue City. The patient is a pillar of the Ji Clan and seems to be the brother of Ji Clan's head. He is an existence with frightening abilities and is one of the guardians the Ji Clan. Moreover, he isn't very old and can protect the Ji Clan for much longer." Yu Xixuan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now felt very comfortable after hearing the good news. It was always nice to obtain more information. It was very important in the monitoring of the changes that some great influences were making.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Blue City's Ji Clan was one of the five great influences there. It would mean that even if they weren't ranked amongst the top five in the Northern Blue Domain, they would still be a notable existence. The top clan in some other cities might still possibly be stronger than the great clans in the Northern Blue City. At a certain level, it would be very difficult to make comparisons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Azure Rainbow City was too far away from the Northern Blue City and the news here wouldn't reach the other place. Qing Shui came up with an idea, "Are you able to spread news to the Northern Blue City?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a good opportunity to build up their reputation. Therefore, Qing Shui felt that there was a need to take it up. Although he hadn’t been seen as invincible in the Northern Blue Domain yet, he should still be ranked amongst the top few. If news of his medical skills could spread out then his influence would grow as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, what Qing Shui needed was influence. He wanted to promote himself and let more people know of his existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can. And if you have the confidence, they'll definitely come to seek treatment." Yu Xixuan said affirmatively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Great. You can go and think of ways to get them to come then. This time around, they'll be the best form of advertisement for me." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then thought of Shen Huang. Which city in the Northern Blue Domain was she in right now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Not good! Someone's creating trouble over there." Just then, someone ran over and said hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan's beautiful brows raised up. "Little Five, make yourself clear. What's the problem?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man who appeared very young and ordinary answered, "A few customers insisted on barging in. They didn't have any tokens and we were unable to stop them. Not only have they managed to barge in but they've even smashed up some of the restaurant's facilities."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they weren't far from the restaurant, it would still take time for them to return to the restaurant. Yu Xixuan wasn't always at the restaurant and would basically just make a trip there every day. However, with her around, people would be able to look for her if anything were to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's go and take a look." Qing Shui stood up and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan nodded and they headed for the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before they arrived, they could hear smashing and crashing sounds in addition to gasps. Many people came out. After all, this was none of their business and no one stepped out to stop those people. Those people seemed very engrossed in thrashing up the place. Some of the restaurant's employees who tried to stop them were beaten up instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Everyone back off. Let them do as they want. Prioritize your safety." Yu Xixuan's voice rang out and the restaurant's employees backed off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood next to Yu Xixuan and examined the people who were smashing up the place. Three of them were young men and there were two other middle-aged men on the older side of the range. The three young men were dressed in extravagance and the arrogance on their faces showed that they didn't come from ordinary backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three young men didn't seem to be that old, and should be slightly younger than Qing Shui. Through their auras, Qing Shui could tell that two of them came from the same influence while the last one didn’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was unfamiliar to everything here and wasn't sure of these people's background. However, Qing Shui's attention was more on the two middle-aged men. Their auras were impressive, deep, and exuded a great confidence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could sense that there was a powerful influence backing them up. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been so confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same applied to the few young men. They were extremely confident but their strengths weren't up to standards. One of them was a Martial Emperor while the other two were Early False Gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now knew that if a clan in a particular circle had some talents then it wouldn't be hard to nurture the talents with the resources they had. However, there was a limit to this. It might be possible for people who were at lower than False Gods or Early False Gods but as for those at the Divine Grade, it would be a little bit tough. Qing Shui probably wasn't able to come into contact with this circle and couldn't tell if there were people in the Divine Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this didn't mean the clans or sects that were prominent influences were all Martial Emperors, False Gods, or Divinities. Although it could be that everyone in the clan had a certain level of cultivation, there would be quite a number of people at the lower cultivation tiers. There was just one thing: Powerful clans would not flourish in their numbers. Despite so, due to their good genes and the great resources they enjoyed, these people would be very strong from a young age.
