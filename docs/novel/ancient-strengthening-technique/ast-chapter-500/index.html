  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 500 - Essence of Emperor’s Qi, Strength greatly increased, Encounter</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The taste of waiting was always dull. Qing Shui felt like doing nothing in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was even worse than cultivation, it was just too boring right now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, that seed!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about that flame-like seed that he had gotten earlier. He decided to plant it and see if anything could grow out of it. Qing Shui was really interested in these unknown expectations. He just worried that it would take too long, but since it was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui was not particularly anxious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui planted the seed at an empty space not far from Flower of Life and decided to forget about it. Whether or not it would germinate now depended on heaven’s will. If the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal could not make it grow, Qing Shui wouldn't have any hope for it then.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time flew by in a blink.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A month had quickly passed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would be kicked out in about a week.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The weakened period had already passed, what made Qing Shui happy was that his strength had actually increased. The Ancient Strengthening technique was surprisingly in its 185th cycle now, which makes Qing Shui feels very surprised.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After swallowing the Great Revitalizing Pellet, the strength of his vessels, Dantian and organs were changed in a shocking way. His vessels were widened, his strength had increased, and the same thing had also happened to his internal organs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although his body had returned to normal, it still reached that state, reached that strength. It showed that his body had the potential, and he had still received quite a lot of benefits after he had returned to normal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The power of his body had now reached eighteen million jin!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Another huge acquisition this time was that Cloudmist Steps had broken through to the Obscure Realm. Thus Qing Shui’s speed had increased by almost a half. That was 50% of his speed! Qing Shui suddenly felt like he had changed from a shotgun blast to cannon fire.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was using Cloudmist Steps in the limits space of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal while feeling happy about the improvement. The increase in speed made Qing Shui happy beyond comparison.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Increasing speed does result in increasing strength, but that could be ignored. Just like the man called Bai Gui from Heavenly Palace. His power was not strong in particular, but with his high speed, he will be really hard to deal with. If he has a divine weapon with him, those who couldn’t absolutely suppress him can’t do anything about him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Two hours had passed when Qing Shui stopped.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Essence of Emperor’s Qi!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a blood-boiling excitement when thinking about this. This Medicinal Pill could definitely be considered as “against the heavens”. After some hesitation, Qing Shui finally decided to consume it so that he would have some more self-protection power at Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui opened the quaint little &nbsp;porcelain vase and realized that there was only one grape-sized gray pill in it. It somehow had the color of the primordial flames, as shiny and transparent, but just contained a bit of gray.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An indescribable but cool smell came out from the pill. Qing Shui hesitated again, then swallowed it without a second bite.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The pill melted in Qing Shui’s mouth at the moment he swallowed it. Passing his throat, the pill then reached his Dantian and a coolness quickly spread through his body. The rich fragrance it emitted as it melted spread in every direction.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The fragrance smelled like both orchid and musk, the richness of it certainly left a feeling of yearning in people. The sweetness that filled his whole mouth was great sensation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon after that, his Dantian was agitated, and the whole body felt like it was being blown up. Then a mighty power poured in from the Baihui Acupoint on the head, directly toward his Dantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A fingernail-sized purple sphere then formed in his Dantian and started to rotate around with the energy from Ancient Strengthening Technique. A thin trace of purple gas automatically ran through the channels and soon finished a cycle. An overbearing manner was clearly shown by the body. It not only made Qing Shui more confident but also filled him with energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">So this is Emperor’s Qi…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like a slight roar could be heard from inside the body, and that his strength had increased by a lot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">20% improvement in all attributes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Except for suppressing 20% of opponents’ powers, this was the special effects of The Essence of Emperor’s Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now had the strength of two countries and the defense of three countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Speed had increased once again. As a Martial Artist, the happiest thing in life would be to improves one’s own strength, especially since he was in Flowerfruit Mountain. Qing Shui estimated that under the condition of “Men Elephant Unison”, he would at least be able to protect himself. Of course, when encountering demonic beasts like the Silver Wolf King, the only thing to do was run.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Emperor’s Qi!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like within the radius of 100 meters to himself, there appeared a palpable sense of &nbsp;suppression, just like the King’s Aura of the Silver Wolf King.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">20% decrease in all attributes, irremovable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the most powerful part. Unlike the Art of Pursuing that Qing Shui used to have, “Emperor’s Qi” cannot be removed by any items or techniques. Its ability to neglect any level differences was the best part.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided to leave now so that the remaining half a week in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal could be saved for future emergencies. There was still a whole day to go, and it would not be pleasant if there was nowhere to hide.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately regretted the decision to come out. It was pouring really hard outside, and Qing Shui’s clothes got soaking wet after standing in it for just a short while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It has been quite a while since I was exposed to the rain, I’ll just get super wet today then.” It would be no problem for Qing Shui to get wet with his current physique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moonlight was covered by dark cloud, and one could barely keep an eye open in the huge rain. It honestly wouldn’t take too long for the rain to bring death to a normal person.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not summon the Fire Bird nor the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Instead, he slowly walked out of the Silver Wolf Ravine alone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui encountered nothing on the way out and soon reached the valley that he had seen when he’d arrived. Qing Shui was a little confused at this point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Initially, he was just here for the Goddess Peak in the first Treasure Map, but he’d accidently bumped into the second Treasure Map. Qing Shui couldn’t help but exclaim at the wonder of everything that happens.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Standing on the mountain top and hearing roars of nature, Qing Shui watched the water falling down far away like a flood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was a flash flood!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It would be abnormal to not have a flash flood in such heavy rain. Many valleys at the foot of the mountains were flooded by water, and beasts roared out when they tried to escape from the water.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everywhere is filled with the sound of rain dropping down onto the earth and trees.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A gigantic lightning bolt suddenly appeared in the sky. Qing Shui shook to dodge and quickly realized that he was at the mountain top. He immediately used Cloudmist Steps and ran toward the foot of the mountain. No matter how strong his body was, Qing Shui never wanted to contend with lightning bolts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just as it was pouring really hard, Qing Shui ran toward the interior of Flowerfruit Mountain. He was pretty low-spirited now because he couldn’t go back to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, nor could he even find a shelter in midnight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just as Qing Shui was thinking about shelter, he found a cave not far in front of him because the darkness can hardly block Qing Shui’s eye-sight. He decided to use the cave as a shelter from the rain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though he was strong, Qing Shui still had to be careful. Who knew if this cave was a nest of demonic beasts? Qing Shui knows that he needs to be very concentrated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly a loud call of a crane burst out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The call comes right from the cave!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Demonic Beast!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Peak Martial Emperor level demonic beast!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The spiritual sense of Qing Shui was really strong, which allowed him to quickly feel the strength of the demonic beast. It was as strong as the big tiger (which always refers to the Golden Eyed Hurricane Tiger of Demonic Beast Sect’s Grand Elder).</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui froze for a short while but finally decided to check it out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, Qing Shui prepared his powers.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He himself had the attack of two countries and defense of three countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cycling through all his techniques, Qing Shui put on his full-body armor and battle shoes, and held up his Violet gold divine shield and Big Dipper Sword. In addition to that, he slapped on many types of Heavenly Talisman to help improve strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s bruce power can almost reach nine countries now!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fully confident, Qing Shui walked toward the cave again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment Qing Shui stepped into the cave, he knew that he had been mistaken. Qing Shui sensed two spirits, with one of them being humans.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Human?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was midnight, how could he meet a person in Flowerfruit Mountain?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a shiver in his spine. He was not afraid of ghosts in particular. Even if they do exist, Qing Shui always felt people are more threatening than ghosts. Since that person had dared to come to Flowerfruit Mountain alone, he must be strong enough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just when Qing Shui was shocked for a moment, a sword was stabbing toward him with a glow in the darkness. The only thing is that the sword does not have enough momentum.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Stop!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly yelled out and subconsciously used the Emperor’s Qi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Snatch was instantly used and slapped on the sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What surprised Qing Shui is that he succeeded in slapping the sword away. Just when he wanted to finish the enemy with a Ripping Tiger Claw, he saw the person who attacked him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A woman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though it was just a quick glance, Qing Shui was still able to identify that!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turns to the crane that was rushing toward him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An azure crane!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Ripping Tiger Claw that Qing Shui planned to use changed to Back Connecting Fist, and knocked onto the incoming crane.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bam!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt really good about this punch after his strength had greatly increased. The Ice Crane had to back up in painful calls because of the power of that punch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Make it stop, or I’ll probably kill it. You have no way to get out without it.” Qing Shui whispered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s you?” The cold tone even made listeners feel freezing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Makes it easier if you recognize me. I’m here to hide from the rain.” Qing Shui was nearly frozen by that tone, but he lightly continued.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman still wore a cerulean dress, with a bamboo hat covering her face, leaving the wonderful body out for people’s imagination.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui knew that she was an ice princess, which made him want to leave right away when he heard the voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Women with such tone were hardest for Qing Shui to deal with. Ice princesses were attractive, but Qing Shui did not feel like he had enough luck to be the destined counterpart of her. He would be begging for trouble if he even tried to lay a hand on such a girl.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The pill melted in Qing Shui’s mouth at the moment he swallowed it. Passing his throat, the pill then reached his Dantian and a coolness quickly spread through his body. The rich fragrance it emitted as it melted spread in every direction.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The fragrance smelled like both orchid and musk, the richness of it certainly left a feeling of yearning in people. The sweetness that filled his whole mouth was great sensation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon after that, his Dantian was agitated, and the whole body felt like it was being blown up. Then a mighty power poured in from the Baihui Acupoint on the head, directly toward his Dantian.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A fingernail-sized purple sphere then formed in his Dantian and started to rotate around with the energy from Ancient Strengthening Technique. A thin trace of purple gas automatically ran through the channels and soon finished a cycle. An overbearing manner was clearly shown by the body. It not only made Qing Shui more confident but also filled him with energy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">So this is Emperor’s Qi…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like a slight roar could be heard from inside the body, and that his strength had increased by a lot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">20% improvement in all attributes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Except for suppressing 20% of opponents’ powers, this was the special effects of The Essence of Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now had the strength of two countries and the defense of three countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Speed had increased once again. As a Martial Artist, the happiest thing in life would be to improves one’s own strength, especially since he was in Flowerfruit Mountain. Qing Shui estimated that under the condition of “Men Elephant Unison”, he would at least be able to protect himself. Of course, when encountering demonic beasts like the Silver Wolf King, the only thing to do was run.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Emperor’s Qi!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like within the radius of 100 meters to himself, there appeared a palpable sense of &nbsp;suppression, just like the King’s Aura of the Silver Wolf King.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">20% decrease in all attributes, irremovable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the most powerful part. Unlike the Art of Pursuing that Qing Shui used to have, “Emperor’s Qi” cannot be removed by any items or techniques. Its ability to neglect any level differences was the best part.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided to leave now so that the remaining half a week in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal could be saved for future emergencies. There was still a whole day to go, and it would not be pleasant if there was nowhere to hide.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately regretted the decision to come out. It was pouring really hard outside, and Qing Shui’s clothes got soaking wet after standing in it for just a short while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It has been quite a while since I was exposed to the rain, I’ll just get super wet today then.” It would be no problem for Qing Shui to get wet with his current physique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moonlight was covered by dark cloud, and one could barely keep an eye open in the huge rain. It honestly wouldn’t take too long for the rain to bring death to a normal person.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not summon the Fire Bird nor the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Instead, he slowly walked out of the Silver Wolf Ravine alone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui encountered nothing on the way out and soon reached the valley that he had seen when he’d arrived. Qing Shui was a little confused at this point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Initially, he was just here for the Goddess Peak in the first Treasure Map, but he’d accidently bumped into the second Treasure Map. Qing Shui couldn’t help but exclaim at the wonder of everything that happens.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Standing on the mountain top and hearing roars of nature, Qing Shui watched the water falling down far away like a flood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was a flash flood!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It would be abnormal to not have a flash flood in such heavy rain. Many valleys at the foot of the mountains were flooded by water, and beasts roared out when they tried to escape from the water.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everywhere is filled with the sound of rain dropping down onto the earth and trees.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A gigantic lightning bolt suddenly appeared in the sky. Qing Shui shook to dodge and quickly realized that he was at the mountain top. He immediately used Cloudmist Steps and ran toward the foot of the mountain. No matter how strong his body was, Qing Shui never wanted to contend with lightning bolts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just as it was pouring really hard, Qing Shui ran toward the interior of Flowerfruit Mountain. He was pretty low-spirited now because he couldn’t go back to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, nor could he even find a shelter in midnight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just as Qing Shui was thinking about shelter, he found a cave not far in front of him because the darkness can hardly block Qing Shui’s eye-sight. He decided to use the cave as a shelter from the rain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though he was strong, Qing Shui still had to be careful. Who knew if this cave was a nest of demonic beasts? Qing Shui knows that he needs to be very concentrated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly a loud call of a crane burst out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The call comes right from the cave!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Demonic Beast!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Peak Martial Emperor level demonic beast!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The spiritual sense of Qing Shui was really strong, which allowed him to quickly feel the strength of the demonic beast. It was as strong as the big tiger (which always refers to the Golden Eyed Hurricane Tiger of Demonic Beast Sect’s Grand Elder).</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui froze for a short while but finally decided to check it out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, Qing Shui prepared his powers.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He himself had the attack of two countries and defense of three countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cycling through all his techniques, Qing Shui put on his full-body armor and battle shoes, and held up his Violet gold divine shield and Big Dipper Sword. In addition to that, he slapped on many types of Heavenly Talisman to help improve strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s bruce power can almost reach nine countries now!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fully confident, Qing Shui walked toward the cave again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment Qing Shui stepped into the cave, he knew that he had been mistaken. Qing Shui sensed two spirits, with one of them being humans.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Human?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was midnight, how could he meet a person in Flowerfruit Mountain?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a shiver in his spine. He was not afraid of ghosts in particular. Even if they do exist, Qing Shui always felt people are more threatening than ghosts. Since that person had dared to come to Flowerfruit Mountain alone, he must be strong enough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just when Qing Shui was shocked for a moment, a sword was stabbing toward him with a glow in the darkness. The only thing is that the sword does not have enough momentum.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Stop!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly yelled out and subconsciously used the Emperor’s Qi.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Snatch was instantly used and slapped on the sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What surprised Qing Shui is that he succeeded in slapping the sword away. Just when he wanted to finish the enemy with a Ripping Tiger Claw, he saw the person who attacked him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A woman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though it was just a quick glance, Qing Shui was still able to identify that!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turns to the crane that was rushing toward him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An azure crane!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Ripping Tiger Claw that Qing Shui planned to use changed to Back Connecting Fist, and knocked onto the incoming crane.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bam!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt really good about this punch after his strength had greatly increased. The Ice Crane had to back up in painful calls because of the power of that punch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Make it stop, or I’ll probably kill it. You have no way to get out without it.” Qing Shui whispered.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s you?” The cold tone even made listeners feel freezing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Makes it easier if you recognize me. I’m here to hide from the rain.” Qing Shui was nearly frozen by that tone, but he lightly continued.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman still wore a cerulean dress, with a bamboo hat covering her face, leaving the wonderful body out for people’s imagination.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui knew that she was an ice princess, which made him want to leave right away when he heard the voice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Women with such tone were hardest for Qing Shui to deal with. Ice princesses were attractive, but Qing Shui did not feel like he had enough luck to be the destined counterpart of her. He would be begging for trouble if he even tried to lay a hand on such a girl.</p>
