 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could make out earlier that the 3rd Palace Master likes Muyun Qingge and that he had also noticed that she didn't like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, Qing Shui didn't bother about it as he wouldn't mind an irrelevant person like the 3rd Palace Master. The increase in his strength brought Qing Shui to a different realm and he didn't feel the need to argue with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Big Sister, Qing Shui has come. I believe he'll give up on his pursuit towards me." Yiye Jiange smiled at Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t think so, Jin Liyu’s temperament is proud and aloof, compared to Qing Shui. You have to be a bit more careful.” Muyun Qingge turned towards Qing Shui and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Though he's the 3rd Palace Master, but why do I feel he has a lot of influence?" Qing Shui couldn't comprehend this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"As large as the Sea King’s Palace is, it needs his Carp Dragon Gate Formation to guard it. He's also quite outstanding and doesn't do anything excessive so we can only avoid him as much as possible." Muyun Qingge said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Fine. Qing Shui, let's go. We'll treat it as a welcoming party for Big Sister." Yiye Jiange laughed as she stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had nothing else to do and since they wanted to go, he accompanied them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they chatted, Qing Shui had already figured out the structure of the Sea King’s Palace. A total of 3 Palace Masters, a few Protectors, Palace Guardians, and also the leaders of each race, such as the Commander of the Shrimp Soldiers, the Chief of the Mermen, and the Leader of the Clam-men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only one Drakaina, only Muyun Qingge, and she was the Supreme Chief of the Sea King’s Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of Jin Liyu wasn't the best but he was strong, and that was also the reason he was able to become the 3rd Palace Master as the Carp Tribe occupied a quite important position in the Sea King’s Palace power structure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It's said that Carps possessed the bloodline of a dragon, and this brought out several strong existences among the countless carps, which gave a lot of authority to the Carp Tribe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu not only liked Muyun Qingge but liked Yiye Jiange too. He ordinarily expressed his love quite freely but didn't do any excessive acts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange refused him, he wasn't discouraged at all. This also troubled these two women. After all, the Sea King’s Palace couldn't lose him and he also hadn't done anything excessive, causing today's situation to occur. These two women just tried to avoid him as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them noticed that Jin Liyu was entertaining everyone in the main hall. After they entered, Qing Shui found that there were around 10 people here. There was Jin Liyu, while half of the guests were wizened old men and the remaining half were all robust young men. Due to their different characteristics, Qing Shui could identify Mermen, Tortoise-men, Clam-men, Black Scales Mermen ....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu saw Qing Shui, Muyun Qingge, and Yiye Jiange; he merrily walked towards them: "You've come. Come on, sit over here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu arranged and pulled back the seats for Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange, just gaving a greeting towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui. Come, sit here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange said once she sat down, hinting him to sit to her right. Muyun Qingge was sitting to her left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was already an old man sitting to the left of Muyun Qingge, so Jin Liyu could only sit to the right of Qing Shui. Qing Shui could see the gloom inside the 3rd Palace Master's eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, right? Let's change our seats. I have some matters to talk with the 2nd Palace Master." Jin Liyu stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't want to!" Qing Shui didn't even raise his head, his gaze fixed at Yiye Jiange...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile rose up on Yiye Jiange's face. The others also looked at Jin Liyu. This made him feel as if Qing Shui wasn't giving him face as he was the 3rd Palace Master and the strong held reverence. In his view, Qing Shui was nothing. Looking at it from any angle, he felt that Qing Shui should have politely given up the seat according to his suggestion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The 3rd Palace Master can sit beside Qing Shui, it isn't that far so we'll be able to hear." Muyun Qingge stated promptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the Chief here and also, she didn't get along with Jin Liyu; she didn't want to see Qing Shui and him fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu's complexion became ugly. This time, Qing Shui could make out that the difference between Beastmen and Humans was the control over emotions. Beastmen pursued strength and had a simple mind. Regarding women, their mindset was that they'll obtain her if they had enough strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely, Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange were stronger than him, therefore, he had to be respectful and use an honest method to pursue. From this, it can be inferred that even a Beastman could see the picture clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange had also noticed that Jin Liyu's complexion had turned quite ugly; she smiled at him: "3rd Palace Master. I forgot to introduce him to you. This is Qing Shui, he's my husband and came here specially to find me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words were like a clap of thunder from the heavens. This made Jin Liyu who was on the edge of going berserk look with stupefaction towards Yiye Jiange and then at Qing Shui. He couldn't imagine how this young human was the husband of this fairy-like 2nd Palace Master...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge looked at Yiye Jiange. Since she had revealed Qing Shui's identity, Jin Liyu would now wind around her more, but Muyun Qingge felt that Jin Liyu would have some conflict with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"3rd Palace Master, right? I heard you pester women quite frequently." Qing Shui turned around and spoke towards Jin Liyu who was still dazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anger appeared on Jin Liyu's face as well as disdain. Where was Qing Shui at? And he was even standing beside him. This made the mood become strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I want to challenge you. I feel you're not suitable for the 2nd Palace Master." Jin Liyu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beastmen liked to battle and use strength to make decisions. They hadn't even spoken a few words and even though he knew Qing Shui was Yiye Jiange's husband, he still didn't want to give up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm not suited to my woman? Then who's suitable? You?" Qing Shui laughed as he stood up while looking at Jin Liyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"An outstanding woman belongs with an outstanding man. I feel I'm more outstanding than you." Jin Liyu said impolitely. Beastmen were always filled with self-confidence and they didn't change their minds often like humans. This was also good. Arrogant but not a hypocrite and even more unaccustomed to politeness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you like the Grand Palace Master?" Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge didn't think Qing Shui would drag her into this as well so she looked at them with puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were silent, but they were rooting for Jin Liyu. He was the 3rd Palace Master of the Sea King’s Palace and his strength was pretty good while he was also quite important to the Sea King’s Palace. The reason the Sea King’s Palace was able to hold on for such a long time was due to a large contribution from Carp Tribe or else the Sea King’s Palace would've fallen, resulting in countless casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes, I like them." Jin Liyu said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was baffled at the Beastman's honesty. He had admitted it without any hesitation. Qing Shui thought that this serene avarice realm was something even he hadn't reached.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Jin Liyu, do you realize the situation? The matters of the Sea King’s Palace are of utmost importance. I've made it clear many times that I don't like you." Muyun Qingge said softly</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know. Even if I couldn't protect the Sea King’s Palace by risking my life, I'll protect you." Jin Liyu said seriously. He hadn't forgotten to express his resolution at this moment. Even the others felt that Jin Liyu was a true man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange laughed, looking towards Qing Shui, hinting that this man's face was also thick and wasn't inferior to his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Okay. All those sitting here today are people on our side so retreat a step back." Muyun Qingge said quickly. She really didn't want to see Jin Liyu and Qing Shui battle. The enemy was outside and if there was an internal struggle now, it'd be the end of the Sea King’s Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"But I feel he's not suitable for the 2nd Palace Master. I can't look at the 2nd Palace Master feel wronged following after him." Jin Liyu stated firmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui became gloomy and couldn't help but say: "What does it matter to you whether I'm suitable or not? Be content with what you have. Why do I feel like you're a stupid c*nt?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Argh. You dared say I'm stupid. I want to challenge you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu believed he was quite intelligent, at least regarding the matters of love. Merely, due to the natural instincts of the Beastmen, there were a few ideals he held onto stubbornly. He had a frank heart and didn't like it when others called him stupid even as a joke. Qing Shui’s words made him feel an unbearable pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't think that his reaction will be so intense. He laughed and said, "Challenge me? Do you even qualify?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I want to have a life-or-death battle with you, do you dare?" Jin Liyu tried to pacify his heart while he looked at Qing Shui with a gaze filled with rage, wishing he could kill Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why should I have a life-or-death battle with you? What's the benefit in killing you?" Qing Shui shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I am the 3rd Palace Master. You'll gain quite the fame if you agree." Jin Liyu said boldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's the benefit for you if you win?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The 2nd Palace Master will become free if I kill you. I can pursue the 2nd Palace Master then. I hate you, so I'll feel quite comfortable if I kill you." Jin Liyu said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also felt powerless against such a 'pure' person. Yiye Jiange was quite calm right now, looking at Qing Shui with a smile, pondering a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't want any fame as it isn't a bit realistic so there's no benefit for me in this." Qing Shui shook his head again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There aren't many who pursue the Grand Palace Master. If you kill me, you can pursue the Grand Palace Master." Jin Liyu explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt for the first time that there was something wrong with this person's brain. It seemed that he had only these two women in his mind and would do anything for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Carp Tribe, they were passionate and infatuate. They never stop pursuing a beautiful woman if they ever saw one. Their nature was romantic and so simple that others felt it was unreasonable. But they also had strength and the only way to handle them was to fight them till they gave up. He followed the words said by the Sea King’s Palace's Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Okay. I accept your life-or-death duel." Qing Shui also became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the persons present here were Beastmen and were war-like, the method they most liked to use to settle an issue was through battle. Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange also didn't prevent them, but Yiye Jiange said softly: "Jin Liyu is quite simplistic. It's fine if you defeat him, there's no need to take his life. His contribution towards the Sea King’s Palace is quite big."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wife, I feel jealous." Qing Shui said to Yiye Jiange with a solemn face.</span></p>
