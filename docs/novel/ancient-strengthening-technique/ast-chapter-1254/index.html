 <p><strong>AST 1254 - One Against Ten, Incapable Of Withstanding Even A Single Blow. Forging The Big Dipper Sword Once Again&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly rotated his palm around her jade peaks. He tried to thoroughly experience the softness and smoothness, while his other hand was placed right at her well-rounded bottom. He looked at her tender and alluring face in mesmerization.</p>
 <p>“Have you had enough?” the Eldest Princess’ eyes looked really charming. It appeared really elegant and appeared to be a bit misty.</p>
 <p>“No, I will never feel satisfied. Be my woman.” Qing Shui’s face was a bit red due to blood congestion as he was trying to hold himself back. Nevertheless, he still asked her seriously.</p>
 <p>“You haven’t made me reach the point where I want to be your woman. Don’t force me.” the Eldest Princess said gently.</p>
 <p>“But you have fallen for me.” Qing Shui moved his body as a way to show that he was thirsting for her.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you only want me for my body? If that’s the case, I can give it to you now. After that, we will no longer know each other. Do you want it?” the Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui seriously.</p>
 <p>“What do you see me as? I like bullying you, and I like everything about you as a whole. Of course, I also like your body.” Qing Shui retracted his hands from below and hugged her tightly.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess said softly: “Have you not taken enough advantage of me today? You are my nemesis. If it have been other people, I would have immediately torn them into pieces.”</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui heard the Eldest Princess’ words, he was moved. He responded happily: “Sunu, do you also share the same feelings towards me?”</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess never expected this brat to actually change the way he called her. She rolled her eyes: “I don’t like you, nor do I hate you. Haven’t you said before that love and affection are different? You only have affection towards me and you are already bullying me like this?”</p>
 <p>“Only when you start having affection for someone will it turn into love. As of now, the feeling I have towards you is already love.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not love. You have said before that love is something which can be tested. Love is selfish. Tell me, will you be able to stand up to love’s trials?” The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui while she pulled away his arms around her waist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a bit upset. Just what kind of nonsense did he said? Great, now she could use it against him. He revealed a bitter smile and said: “It’s only when someone love the other person to the extreme that it will turn selfish. But love is very weak, it can change very easily. So love requires responsibility as well.”</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui finished speaking, the Eldest Princess kissed his cheek on her own accord. “You are still a man. If you have said something different, I would never marry you in my entire life. Furthermore in the future, you too no longer have to think about ever touching me again.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that it was a close call. She was testing him. However, he too understood very quickly. After all, she knew that he had wives, but she still let him hug her. This could already justify one thing. If he thought that this woman would ask him to only have herself as his wife, if he really did misinterpret her intentions to be this, he would only be destined to lose this woman.</p>
 <p>“So are you finally going to promise to marry me now?”</p>
 <p>“No, but I can fulfill a small request for you as a way to send you off. If the request is too much, I will cancel it immediately.” the Eldest Princess embraced Qing Shui’s neck and whispered to his ear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s blood within his body boiled, it was just a small request which wasn’t too excessive. He immediately carried the Eldest Princess and had managed to bring her into his room in an instant.</p>
 <p>“My cultivation doesn’t allow me to lose my virginity.”</p>
 <p>Merely these few gentle words which came out of the Eldest Princess’ mouth already made Qing Shui completely gave up the scheme he planned in his heart. Originally, he thought that he might be able to eat her up, but he now lost the intention to do so. Regardless of whether it was true or false, he would still need to respect her.</p>
 <p>“I find it really hard to hold in. Just think of a way to help me force it out!” Qing Shui whispered beside her ears. He even went to the extent that he grabbed her jade-like hand then placed it on the firm and upright part of his body.</p>
 <p>The woman immediately retracted her hand as her body also trembled.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, you promised to me before. This shouldn’t be too much, should it?”</p>
 <p>………..</p>
 <p>Eventually, Qing Shui still took off his clothes. That malevolent brat managed to make the Eldest Princess feel extremely shy as he slowly inserted it into her mouth. At that moment, her expression, which was filled with shock, fright and shyness, were very arousing to look at. It was only after a relentless amount of effort that she managed to get a grip of herself and began to move under Qing Shui’s guidance.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess finally left. Qing Shui on the other hand, still had the previous beautiful scenes in his mind. At the second he ejaculated, the adorable look which the Eldest Princess showed as she quickly ran away was imprinted in his mind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who regained his composure pondered over when he should leave. It could be considered that he had now confirmed his relationship with the Eldest Princess. Of course, he was the one who confirmed it himself. He would definitely not let this woman ran away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left and the girls watched him as he departed.</p>
 <p>Now, the direction where Qing Shui headed to was precisely towards the Divine Might Dynasty.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui made his way towards the Divine Might Dynasty, the one thing he thought about the most was Di Chen. The reason why he came to the Western Oxhe Continent was precisely for Di Chen. The Divine Might Dynasty was the dynasty closest to him at the other half of the Western Oxhe Continent. It was also a very powerful fourth grade dynasty.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Step!</p>
 <p>During this time, the Nine Continents Steps Effect didn’t get upgraded. He remembered the Demon Lord, the woman who could shuttle back and forth around the nine continents. He didn’t know what she relied on in order to do so. Could it be the Divine Turtle?</p>
 <p>It was always been emphasized that the largest obstacle one could meet in passing back and forth the continents were the huge ocean. Could it be because this Divine Turtle had miraculous magical power in the ocean?</p>
 <p>Every time he thought about this woman, he would get a slight headache. She had enemies with the people who followed the right path in at least one continent. Or at least, this was what was shown to the public. The Demon Lord Palace, Qing Shui believed that he would need a strength worth around 10,000 sun if he wanted to meet her safely. Just how strong was that woman?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to do things realistically without any flights of fancy. He decided that he would go with the flow and see what would happen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who had made a decision stopped keeping his mind revolved around these things.</p>
 <p>He rode on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Only when a particular time was reached, he would enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to cultivate. When he came out, he would continue through his journey.</p>
 <p>However, not long after he flew out of the sphere of influence of the Heaven Secrets Academy, he found himself surrounded by people. Qing Shui was really shocked. After all, he had used the Nine Continents Step Effect many times during his journey. He could still actually be targeted by other people. This was definitely something to be surprised about.</p>
 <p>The people who stopped him were all old men. All of them had faces as gloomy as dripping water. When they looked at Qing Shui, it was like they were itching to tear him into thousand pieces as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>“Why are you guys trying to stop me?” Qing Shui asked the two old men with hunched back.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t because they were here, anyone would find it difficult to relate these two old men as expert warriors.</p>
 <p>“Because you deserved it.” The old man on the left side said as he lifted up his hand.</p>
 <p>“Who are you guys? I don’t think I have offended any of you before.” At the moment, QIng Shui wanted to know who these people were. Even though he could roughly guess their identity, he still had no idea who was behind them.</p>
 <p>It would be very easy for Qing Shui to escape as he had the Holy Jade Divine Stone Ring and Nine Continents Boots. Hence, he didn’t panic. Besides, with his current strength, there were only very few people who could actually beat him.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui could feel that the people opposite him were also very strong. They should have a strength around 3,000 sun. So, there were a total of ten people with a strength worth 3,000 sun opposite him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt puzzled. Who would actually go this far just to pick a fight with him?</p>
 <p>Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his strength and summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and looked at the people opposite him. “I don’t care who you are. You guys will still be able to make it if you leave now. If you really want to die, don’t blame me for what I will do later.”</p>
 <p>“Ignorant, impudent brat! Die!”</p>
 <p>The old man on the right side swung the dragon staff in his hand towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui triggered his mind, the Nine Continents Mountain appeared immediately. It forged its way towards the old man.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Dragon Whip!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>An enormous flame dragon instantly whipped towards the old man with bright flame.</p>
 <p>The old man immediately got whipped by Qing Shui’s attacks. It was obvious that he had already got injured as he revealed a dispirited expression.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He had actually met the 20% chance to double his prowess.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In just a short while, Qing Shui had eliminated nearly one third of these old men's strength. As this happened, they were only left with about 1,000 sun of strength.</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>The surroundings immediately got covered by a huge ocean.</p>
 <p>Monstrous Wave, Toppling Mountains and Ocean!</p>
 <p>At Qing Shui’s current strength, his most powerful attack was the Seal of Roc. However, the one which was truly intimidating was his controlling ability. Of course, it would be a different story if his Seal of Roc could meet the 20% chances to double its prowess.</p>
 <p>Originally, the effect of the 20% to double his prowess was supposed to be absolutely powerful. However, with no idea since when, it seemed like it had gotten a bit weaker. From Qing Shui’s perspective, it seemed to be less than 10%, or even less than 5%. He found this really hard to understand.</p>
 <p>Seal of Roc!</p>
 <p>With just one move, Qing Shui managed to push one of the old man back into the dark vortex. He quickly continued on his attack with the enormous wave from the Toppling Mountains and Sea.</p>
 <p>Ruthless Fire and Water!</p>
 <p>Water Binding Force!</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui showed his opponents his formidable controlling ability. In just a blink of an eye, one of the nine old men got injured whereas the others experienced great reduction in speed. Both their hands and feet were bound among the boundless ocean.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Roaming Dragon Step!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was like a roaming dragon in the deep sea. He kept the Nine Continent Mountains coordinated to his movement. To his opponents, each of his attacks were heavy burdens to them as he was using the Seal of Roc in all of his attacks.</p>
 <p>In one of his attacks, he managed to meet the 20% chance of doubling his attack prowess and ended up killing his opponent instantly.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui was with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, as long as he weakened his opponent and used the State of One With Elephant, every one Seal of Roc which he unleashed would be fatal attacks to them.</p>
 <p>Since the massacre had already started, Qing Shui found no need to hold back. As a result of the boost he received in his Spirit Energy, the strength of both his Tidal Cloud Wave Seal and his Seal of Xuantian had also been significantly increased.</p>
 <p>The Instantaneous Diamond Evasion of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant could help let it stand at an absolute advantage against opponents on the same level. It could defend and attack at godly speed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately left the place once he retrieved all of the interspatial silk sachets. However, what made him upset in the end was that among the men, two were from the Tian Clan, four were from the Fu Clan, and the rest were from the other clans.</p>
 <p>Aristocratic Clan also had a lot of internal conflicts with each other. A lot of people would thirst for the position of the Clan’s Head. Qing Shui wasn’t surprised about it. Now, he wanted to run away. There were too few people who could stop him in the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>This time, upon entering the paradise, Qing Shui saw the Yang Stone. He made up his mind to once again forge the Big Dipper Sword. This way, he would be able to help himself increase a significant amount of strength.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, he had never thought of doing this. However this time, he was heading off to the Divine Might Dynasty, it would be advantageous for him to raise a bit of his strength. After all, he was alone there. Things would be really bad if he ran into any expert warriors.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui was really excited. He hoped that he could make the Big Dipper Sword turn into a legendary grade weapon. He was really looking forward to it. If he really managed to do that, his strength would once again be able to experience another significant increase.</p>
 <p>False God, he wondered what kind of strength would be considered to had stepped into the huge door of the False God Realm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui retrieved his mind and dedicated all of it into forging the metal.</p>
 <p>He smelted the Big Dipper Sword. The Big Dipper Sword acted as the heart of his sword. Simultaneously, it was also the bone of his sword.</p>
 <p>After that, he started to refine the Yang Stone and blended it drop by drop into his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Since his strength had increased, the power of the Primordial Flame also increased significantly. Compared to before, the speed at which he melted the Yang Stone was a lot faster now. But even so, he still needed almost 49 days to melt it.</p>
 <p>He had already used up roughly one-third of the Yang Stone. Actually, this one-third of it was already enough to forge a sword. However, when blending it into the Big Dipper Sword, it only gave an additional faint thread of gold color to its edge. In terms of its size and thickness, there weren’t that much changes.</p>
 <p>Following on, he started to hammer and refine it. The most crucial moment had come. Qing Shui prayed that it would achieve the legendary grade.</p>
