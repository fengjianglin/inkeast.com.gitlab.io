 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Tribulation was finally here!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knitted his brows. But very soon, he calmed down knowing that it shouldn’t be a problem for Yiye Jiange to make it through her Seventh Divine Grade Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange stood there as she looked at the continuously flashing thunders in the sky. She then turned around and gave Qing Shui a look that signaled him not to worry about her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded and moved back a few steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, the first thunder finally struck. It was a very thin lightning. The snow-white electricity immediately intruded Yiye Jiange’s body and was absorbed completely by her. The first few lightning were very prominent as they were the benefits given to those who had attempted their tribulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange was traveling back and forth at the center of these flashes of lightning as she continuously took in them. Her body was also constantly being strengthened alongside her bones and blood. All of these boosts in strength were visible to the naked eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why warriors tended to look forward, but at the same time, were also afraid of their tribulations. Once they successfully made it through their tribulations, their strength would multiply by folds. Similarly, their bones and organs would also receive boosts up to the same amount. However, if they were to fail to make it through the tribulations, they could only suffer the fate of disappearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, the thunders in the sky were almost the thickness of a small thumb. However, there were still some thin thunders visible among them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people tested with their tribulations were required to experience the Nine Heavenly Thunders within this region of thunders. The term “Nine Heavenly” was just a term. It would be more accurate to call it nine waves of thunders instead, with each being more intense than the previous ones. However, their durations were almost the same. The only thing which differed between each wave was their power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To face off against the tribulations, one could try to constantly avoid the lightning within the region of thunder. Avoid the thick ones while absorbing those thinner ones. The other method of resisting it would be using certain treasures that were capable of absorbing lightning. Those objects came in very rare quantities. Usually, they could only be used once. In other words, they could only absorb the lightning once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alternatively, there were also those that could be used for an unlimited amount of times, but could only absorb one lightning at a time. It didn’t matter if a person had brought one or a few of these things at once. The effect would just be the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, Qing Shui had already possessed a very vast knowledge about the Heavenly Talismans. He knew how to draw the Lightning Avoidance Talisman. However, similar to what was mentioned above, it could only be used once. Right now, Yiye Jiange was already equipped with one of it. It would be pointless to bring any more than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange was very agile. She was able to move around the region of thunders very easily. The white clothes she was wearing made her look even more like a lively fairy. Even Qing Shui was in a bit of a daze as he watched her movements. To think that such a beautiful woman could be his… As he thought back to just a moment ago, when he was still having fun on top of her, he couldn’t help but have a feeling of satisfaction which words couldn’t describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was already the seventh waves of lightning. By now, the size of the lightning in the air was almost as thick as a child’s arm. Furthermore, they were also very concentrated as they rained down. There were already very few lightning that was the size of thumbs. Again and again, Yiye Jiange dodged away from the enormous lightning and landed on the places where the thinner lightning had struck to absorb their energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a period of time, Yiye Jiange’s body has gotten a lot more powerful than before, when she went through her tribulation. The rays of lightning that were the thickness of a thumb had all been absorbed by Yiye Jiange. Right before this wave of lightning had completely subsided, Yiye Jiange failed to dodge away from one of the thicker lightning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart tightened immediately when he saw this scene. However, he realized that not only was Yiye Jiange fine but she had even managed to absorb the entire lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Qing Shui’s honest opinion on the lightning was that they weren’t really that strong. He remembered the time when he was going through his Divine Tribulations. The first wave of the lightning which struck around him were already the size of an arm. Later on, the lightning had even become so big, it would be comparable to the waist of an adult man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The final two waves of lightning weren’t as thick as Qing Shui expected. The last one was only around an arm’s proportion. Yiye Jiange went head-to-head with it once. Though she was only able to barely take it, eventually, she managed to take it all in. It was until when the final lightning had finally subsided that Yiye Jiange was standing wobbly and was on the verge of collapsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quickly moved forward to grab her, “You mustn’t rest. Take this opportunity to stabilize your current strength. This will give you a lot of benefits in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui had finished speaking, he poked her Lingtai Acupoint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange nodded and sat down on the grass field with her legs crossed. She began revolving her martial techniques and only opened her eyes after going through a great circulatory cycle. She no longer looked exhausted. While exposing her bright eyes and white teeth, the magnificent woman looked at Qing Shui, “I have broken through to the mid-stage of Seventh Divine Grade.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good. What a surprise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui was able to gauge Yiye Jiange’s strength. It was slightly above ten thousand Dao Force, which was already considered quite decent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The sky is getting dark. Let’s head back.” Yiye Jiange sheathed her sword and said while looking into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time he returned to his home, everyone had already eaten their dinner. Both Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange then casually had theirs. The little brat was already asleep. Qing Shui wanted to go to Yiye Jiange’s room to spend a night with her but got kicked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood Yiye Jiange’s feelings. Facing such a magnanimous woman, even he couldn’t help but feel a bit guilty. He shook his head as he walked into Qing Hanye’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took just a soft push and the door was already opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye was awake and was flipping through a book. When she saw Qing Shui, she smiled and greeted, “You are back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While talking, she went on to get a teapot and poured a cup of tea for Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was quite rare to have moonlight on nights like these. As it shone into her room, it made it seem a bit hazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were very few Light Stones in Qing Hanye’s room. Hence, compared to the other rooms, it seemed a bit darker in here. Even when she was flipping through her book, she was doing it under a Light Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong? Is there anything you would like to talk with me?” Qing Shui asked as he sat next to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye blushed. However, she seemed very happy. She embraced Qing Shui’s neck and whispered in his ear, “I am pregnant with your child.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stunned and embraced her, “Are you happy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a long time. Though Qing Shui wasn’t in a rush, he didn’t purposely try to control it. Initially, he thought that even after he left, Qing Hanye wouldn’t be pregnant. What went out of his expectation was that she still got pregnant eventually, which was still a great thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the start, Qing Shui had planned to help her raise her strength. But now, no matter how he tried to convince her, she had stubbornly refused to do it. She was afraid that she would trigger the Divine Tribulations and hence, she said to only talk about it once she had given birth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the current Qing Hanye, nothing would be more important than the baby that was in her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui was aware that Qing Hanye had possessed a formidable body physique. Even if she were to raise her strength, it wouldn’t influence the baby. Besides, the baby was just one month old at the moment. Qing Shui had helped her examined her pulse and confirmed that she was pregnant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Qing Shui was really excited to see the child that would be born from the merging of Nine Yin and Nine Yang body physiques. He couldn’t help but think about what the baby would achieve in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, who didn’t have to raise his strength, enjoyed the nurture from a beautiful woman with Qing Hanye in their room.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the next day, Qing Shui had originally planned to travel to the palace. However, out of his expectation, the Patriarch of the Xia Clan had come alongside the Thirteenth Prince and Wen Jian. Qing Shui greeted the old man to the Imperial Cuisine Hall with a warm welcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!” The Thirteenth Prince happily greeted Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But everything turned awkward when the Thirteenth Prince tried to greet Yiye Jiange and the other girls. Nevertheless, with a serious tone, the Thirteenth Prince still called them master’s mistresses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange and Qing Hanye were very calm. The remaining women, however, all felt a bit awkward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui first helped both the old men cleanse the impurities within their body. He used the Five Elements Art and Force of Rebirth to help the old men remove the poisons from their body and trigger the activities of their aged organs. Just by doing these, half a day had already passed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effect was quite decent. Both the old men’s lifespans were increased by almost seventy years. Though these were just some rough figures, if there were no accidents, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was their lifespan extended, they even experienced a huge chunk of boost in strength, which was an unexpected surprise to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At noon, he prepared a huge banquet of food in the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Naturally, this also included a huge amount of wine. The two old men that were eating also had nothing but words of praise for the food prepared by him. Seeing that they really enjoyed it, Qing Shui gave the two old men some of the ingredients since he had quite a few in stock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the afternoon, Qing Shui assisted the Thirteenth Prince in stabilizing his strength. This was his own disciple. Once he was gone, the girls along with the Imperial Cuisine Hall would still be here. Hence, it was very important for his disciple to be very strong. He mustn’t be careless with this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the Thirteenth Prince had finally stabilized. It should roughly be about 18000 Dao Force, which was a reasonable strength. Qing Shui passed on as many formidable killer-moves as he knew about the Bear Form to him. He was the Ferocious Bear Battle God Inheritor. With his current strength, he could basically make it through the rest of his cultivation fairly easily.</span></p>
