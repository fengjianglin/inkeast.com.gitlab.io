 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan still felt that this guy was very daring. However, he was also considerate at the same time. Most importantly, he wasn't angry. She even had some other kind of indescribable feeling and looked at Qing Shui with a solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lass, I'll feel anxious if I'm being stared at like this?" Qing Shui said, a little exaggerated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was stunned. Being called lass made her feel like laughing yet there was also an indescribable warmth. She put up a rare smile, "Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was very clever and could tell what Qing Shui was thinking. She knew that this guy had been concerned about her feelings. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been this careful all this time, keeping to himself, and only occasionally taking advantage with his words. However, he had never been overboard with his actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was mainly due to the situation from when they had first met. Qing Shui was now showing sufficient respect and care for her. He was afraid that the matter back then would leave a trauma in Tantai Lingyan's heart. Therefore, he had been waiting, waiting for signs of Tantai Lingyan having relaxed, or giving some signs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with Tantai Lingyan's character, it was very hard fro her to take this one step forward. Therefore, Qing Shui wanted to create the the chance. It was very difficult, otherwise, he wouldn't have not made much progress in terms of their physical contact. However, he was already very satisfied with this. It was because her mental state had changed tremendously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. He said that he was going to kiss her, but she thanked him instead. He stared at her blankly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui's expression and took the initiative to take his hand. This made Qing Shui feel very agitated. What that shocked him even more was that Tantai Lingyan had planted the lightest kis son his cheek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you satisfied now?" Tantai Lingyan asked shyly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took Qing Shui a while before he got back to his senses. The changes that Tantai Lingyan had been through in the past was great enough, but the changes she showed today was beyong his expectations. He touched his face and grinned, "Not satisfied!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Rascal, you aren't allowed to ask for more than what you can get." Tantai Lingyan said shyly, a little annoyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that she wasn't very thick-skinned. Even if she was his, she still needed time. Therefore, he quickly gave her a hug, "Satisfied, I'm really very satisfied. I thought that I'd have to wait 100 years for this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm worried that there'd be powerful experts from the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect coming. Do you think that we'll be fine?" Tantai Lingyan changed the topic and asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They reached the small place that belonged to them and was in their living room. Tantai Lingyan quickly poured Qing Shui and herself a cup of tea and they sat opposite each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you scared? Today's tea taste so good." &nbsp;Qing Shui picked up the tea and tooked a sip as he said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You must have toyed with the feelings of quite a number of girls!" Tantai Lingyan also picked up her tea and said, smiling. Right now, there were no more barriers between herself and Qing Shui. But it was only between herself and Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was considered a tremendous improvement for Tantai Lingyan to be able to ask a question like this. Qing Shui thought of how she had given him a kiss earlier and her action explained many things. He smiled and shook his head, "I don't ever lie to my women."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui said this, he was looking at Tantai Lingyan with a clear yet scorching gaze. Tantai Lingyan felt a little anxious and lowered her head a little. "I'm not your woman."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"In my heart, you have always been my woman. You can forget about escaping from me in this lifetime." Qing Shui reached out his hand, lifted her chin, and said with an air of dominance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was a headstrong lady, but was also a strong one. However, this was the first time that a man had lifted her chin so frivolously and she felt a little anxious. She also felt an indescribable feeling, her heart was beating faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was putting up a bold front, ready to keep himself in check if things wasn't going in the right direction. However, he hadn't expected this headstrong lady to be like an embarrassed and docile lady rght now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, his hand was still smacked away by Tantai Lingyan. However, Qing Shui laughed out loud without any restraints. It was an indescribable great feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What are you laughing at? You're getting increasingly overboard." Tantai Lingyan said angrily. She wasn't really angry but her emotions seemed a bit messed up. She felt that she had changed and that she seemed to be in love. In that instant, the sky, which hadn't seem to be clear, now cleared up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped laughing and walked right up to Tantai Lingyan. As she was now seated, Qing Shui squatted down before her, put his two hands on her legs, then lifted her head and looked at aher, "Miss, did you realize that you're a special lady today?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no end to this." Tantai Lingyan moved away his hands and said before escaping back to the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't chase after her but just smiled as her unparalleled silhouette disappeared from his sight. His mind was extraordinarily calm. Even if it was to protect her, he must stop the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect this time around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another three days passed by. Yin Tian and Old Wang had recovered a little, but was still far from being able to participate in the fight. However, they felt a lot better. Previously, they had sustained very serious injuries and even suspected that they might not be able to recover. Right now, they had gotten back a little confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Yin Tian trusted that Qing Shui could treat any kind of injuries. After all, his condition wasn't as serious as it was before. However, their cultivation had been considered to be completely crippled, so they hadn't expected that Qing Shui would be able to treat this as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect appeared once again. This time around, only three people came, but they had an overwhelming aura. Qing Shui appeared in the sky at the first moment, as if he was waiting for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's brows were furrowed deeply. Right now, he was all tensed up and both the Dark Phoenix and Long Zhu`er were next to him. As for the others, Qing Shui didn't let them come up. Moreover, he was already prepared and had set up a formation. Therefore, it was very hard for anyone to do anything bad to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was still very confident in his formations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young man, it's unexpected that there's an existence like yourself. I feel bad that they have died, but we feel that it's a pity to kill you." An old man in the middle with a sturdy body and white brows and hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man's voice sounded as if he had been through a lot in life, but also seemed to reflect that he was a person of great bearing. The old man's aura was also like the aura of a sovereign. His face appeared to be very stern, without a smile at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had finally encountered cultivators who were stronger than him, and there were three of them. However, Qing Shui now felt that the other two were only just a bit stronger than himself. Only the old man in the middle seemed to be unfathomable. The old man's gaze made Qing Shui felt very uncomfortable as well.</span></p>

He felt nervous, but even more excited. Looking at this old man, he had no idea what rank he held in the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect. However, it was definitely not a low one. What Qing Shui was even more afraid was that there might be even more powerful existences behind this old man. If that was the case, Qing Shui would feel that he might really not be able to handle them.</span></p>

By this time, Qing Shui had already calmed down and he looked at the old man on the opposite.</span></p>

You can probably only be described as being a monster. However, you still need time. It's a pity that I can't give you time." The old man was very serious. These words might really be what he was thinking.</span></p>
