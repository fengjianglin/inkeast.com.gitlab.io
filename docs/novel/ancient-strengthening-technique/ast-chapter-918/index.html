 <p><strong>AST 918 - Great Wine and Beauty, Ties Are Priceless</strong></p>
 <p>"Come, take a seat and have some wine. This wine is quite good." Qing Shui smiled and poured some for Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing helplessly sat down next to Qing Shui and picked up that translucent jade cup. Even the wine in it was translucent like jade, exuding an intoxicating light fragrance.</p>
 <p>Drinking it down in one gulp, Mu Qing's beautiful eyes lit up as she looked at Qing Shui, her eyes filled with disbelief. This was simply unbelievable. Nv`er Hong was astonishing enough to begin with and this wine was clearly many tiers higher than Nv`er Hong. It was light and had a faint fragrance to it. It even gave the feeling that it would seep right into one's bones.</p>
 <p>This was a feeling as if it would cleanse one's bones, meridian channels and internal organs. This was the reason she had found it unbelievable.</p>
 <p>"This was brewed from a variant of the plum blossoms." Qing Shui smiled and poured her another cup.</p>
 <p>"It's really very nice!" Mu Qing looked at Qing Shui and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"I also think that it's nice. You can't find it anywhere else." Qing Shui smiled and poured her another cup again.</p>
 <p>"It's best to drink less of good stuff." Mu Qing shook her head slightly, not continuing.</p>
 <p>"Why?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>"All good things come in extremely small quantities. I don't want to develop a reliance on it. I'm afraid of getting addicted and yet there's none to be found. Wouldn't that be very painful?" Mu Qing smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't try to convince her. What she said was similar to how it was when people in his previous life got involved in drugs. This Plum Blossom Wine was much more amazing than the drugs from his previous life but it wouldn’t make one overly reliant on it, unless the person had extremely weak self-restraint. Neither would it make one thin down to their bones.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the people in the world of the nine continents had better physiques than the people in his previous life.</p>
 <p>"Actually, this thing won't make you develop a reliance to it. You don't have to worry." Qing Shui smiled. Mu Qing didn't drink anymore but just looked at him quietly. It was because after not seeing him for half a day, she realized that this guy was now unfamiliar to her once again.</p>
 <p>This time around, it was a change to his disposition. This man who was younger than her was now like a calm ocean, serene and had an indescribable feeling.</p>
 <p>A faint and refreshing aura came from him. It was very nice but wasn't a deadly attraction. However, it was very comfortable. Mu Qing lifted her head and when she saw that Qing Shui was smiling as he looked at her, she couldn't help but blush. Earlier, she was the one who had been staring at him.</p>
 <p>Thinking about this, she no longer feared his gaze and just looked at him with a flushed face. After all, he knew her feelings and in his eyes, she must be very thick-skinned...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's smile made Mu Qing blush even more.</p>
 <p>"Why are you looking at me like this?"</p>
 <p>"I think it's Young Miss who has been looking at me" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Don't call me Young Miss, call me by my name" Mu Qing bit her lips and said.</p>
 <p>"Why?"</p>
 <p>"It makes me feel that you're being very distant towards me and I don't want it to be like that..."</p>
 <p>"Mu Qing!" Qing Shui smiled and called her name.</p>
 <p>"Mmm!" Mu Qing replied happily.</p>
 <p>"Help pour me some wine."</p>
 <p>"You're shameless!" Mu Qing chided but picked up the wine pot and filled up 70% of Qing Shui's cup.</p>
 <p>"With great wine and a beauty here, I'll reject even the offer to become a god." Qing Shui smiled, picking up the wine cup and drank it down in one gulp.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing's face had a satisfied smile as well.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When the sky turned dark, Qing Shui and Mu Qing headed out the backyard and went to get Mu Clan's old man to head to the hall. It was agreed that everyone from Mu Clan would be having a reunion dinner together.</p>
 <p>And Qing Shui had long since been treated as a member of Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>There weren't less than 200 people in the hall and all the people here regardless of their age and gender were all from the direct line of descendants, the people who were the closest to them. Mu Clan's old man, Qing Shui, Mu Fengyang and the others sat at the leading seats.</p>
 <p>Of course Mu Qing was around as well. She was even seated next to Qing Shui...</p>
 <p>This banquet was very lively and they had a sumptuous meal. What could be made and anything that could be thought of were all available. This was considered a birthday celebration since it was basically as if they were given a new life.</p>
 <p>After having been through this, most of the people in the Mu Clan had gone through some slight changes. For one, they felt free, for another, they came to understand a lot of things and knew what they should do. There were even those who could see further and knew that having passed this trial, Mu Clan might be able to gain more status.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was naturally the busiest one here. Mu Clan's old man seemed to be very happy as well. He didn't say much but just looked at the scene before him. Mu Fengyang and the others didn't say much either. It was actually Mu Qian's and Mu Qing's generation which were the liveliest.</p>
 <p>However, Mu Qing's generation found it hard to be at ease before Qing Shui. They came to realize that not knowing when, this young man was already like a towering mountain which they could only admire from the side and could never hope to attain. He was an unrivaled fiend.</p>
 <p>If it wasn't for the fact that Mu Qing had become a supporting pillar between them, they would never have any interactions with this young man. However, they had now formed an interaction with him and he was even going to help Mu Clan tide through their greatest crisis.</p>
 <p>Right now, no one would have any dissatisfaction with Qing Shui. There would be no eggs intact under an overturned nest. Moreover, right now, everyone could not help but hope that Qing Shui would get together with Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't fazed by these kinds of events. In fact, most of the people here were unrelated to him and he merely responded to them simply. Thankfully, not many people came to get close to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Another thing was that Mu Clan's danger had not been completely resolved, but they were all extremely confident right now. Their confidence came from this young man, since they themselves were of no help.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't eat much. Neither did Mu Qing. Mu Clan's old man, who sat opposite them, kept on looking at Qing Shui right from the very beginning.</p>
 <p>After a slight astonishment, the smile on his face continued to remain so peaceful.</p>
 <p>This peacefulness gave Qing Shui a disturbing feeling. That was a feeling of having no desires nor wants and it was even one free of any restraints and attachments. Qing Shui let out a sigh. To think that the improvement to his cultivation brought this old man's life to its end.</p>
 <p>It was because the old man was now free of any worries. It might be because he had been too tired.</p>
 <p>The banquet didn't last too late into the night and everyone headed back. Mu Clan's old man and Qing Clan sat in the cooling backyard, drinking the Plum Blossom Wine Qing Shui took out. The old man was very happy and drank quite a lot. He didn't ask what this wine was nor did he said that it was delicious. He wasn't even very surprised...</p>
 <p>"Old Master, why do you have to do this?" Eventually, Qing Shui still frowned and ask.</p>
 <p>"I knew that you would ask. Very well, since you've already realized, it just means that you're already very strong now and I'm also assured now. Qing Shui, can you do me a favor?" The old man's tone was extremely calm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly, "I know but Sky Prison Sect still has two experts. Are you able to feel at ease?"</p>
 <p>He knew that the old man's decision to leave was firm.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, I'll leave after those two old men," the old man smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened his mouth and wanted to say more but Mu Clan's old man waved his hand, "Although powerful cultivators have a long lifespan, sometimes having a long lifespan might not necessarily be a good thing. It's just like right now, I feel very lonely. I watched as my parents and brothers left me one by one, feeling excruciating. I even had to see my children and grandchildren leave me. This isn't enjoying life, this is torture. They say the longer one lives, the more inhumane they become. Those who are human don't have long lives and even strong bodies won't be able to withstand emotional pains..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a calm and dreamless night.</p>
 <p>The next day, he had a leisurely rest. Most of the time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had been spent on familiarizing himself on the explosive surge of power he had just gotten. He needed to let his powers be fully merged together.</p>
 <p>The effects were quite good and one day in the realm was equivalent to 100 days outside. Moreover, Qing Shui had great talent and thus all these were completed very quickly.</p>
 <p>When he was free, he would occasionally go into the air and looked into the far distance. Although he knew that the two monsters wouldn't come so quickly, he still kept a lookout for them. This might be a subconscious act since there was a limit to the distance he could see.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!" Mu Qing shouted out for Qing Shui who was in the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and descended and then walked toward the lady in the pavilion who was smiling as beautifully as a flower.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was used to this. He already knew of Mu Clan's old man's plan and he was going to help Mu Clan. This lady before him right now was the most important.</p>
 <p>"You look very happy." Qing Shui sat opposite her, picked up a cup and took a sip.</p>
 <p>"You don't like to see me happy?" Mu Qing asked.</p>
 <p>"I remember that when I first saw you, you were like the unattainable stars in the sky. However, right now, in my eyes, you're the most beautiful," Qing Shui smiled and said to Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>"You only know how to act mysterious. You're so strong but you kept on letting me feel worried..."</p>
 <p>At the mention of being worried, Mu Qing still felt slightly embarrassed since their relationship was still quite vague. This man hadn't shown any indications and it was still a one-sided love on her side. Thinking about this, she couldn't help but feel bitter.</p>
 <p>She had never expected that something like this would happen to her.</p>
 <p>"Let me give you something. I don't know whether you'll like it or not." Qing Shui smiled and handed Mu Qing a Violet Jade Sword and a box.</p>
 <p>"For me?" Mu Qing looked at the beautiful Violet Jade Sword and the box which she had no idea what was inside as she said in astonishment. She was shocked that this man would give her things.</p>
 <p>"You don't like them?" Qing Shui hadn't expected her to be so surprised.</p>
 <p>"They are given by you. I like them a lot," Mu Qing said happily and picked up the Violet Jade Sword which looked very beautiful. She felt that it was an accessory but she didn't really care what it actually was. She only cared that this was given to her by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>However, the moment she picked it up, she was astonished. This was a powerful weapon, much more so than her own. People who were below Martial Emperor seldom have weapons which could increase their strength three times or more. The limit was usually at double. It was because there weren't many who would be able to handle a tripling of their strength but of course there were exceptions.</p>
 <p>And the Violet Jade Swords which Qing Shui had forged could be said to be the best weapon for those who were Martial Emperor or lower. They gave an additional doubling of strength to the user.</p>
 <p>She looked at the Violet Jade Sword in a daze. The violet glow reflected against her beautiful face, giving off a dreamy feeling. The sword and the beauty reflected each other's beauty.</p>
 <p>It was very long after that she looked at Qing Shui, "This sword is too valuable."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head and said after a while, "There's a price to items but ties are priceless. As long as you like it, it will have a value. If you don't it'll just be a piece of junk."</p>
 <p>A brilliant pink blush appeared on Mu Qing's face. Qing Shui fell into a daze and then shook his head, smiling. It wasn't because he lacked self-restraint but because the woman's beauty was unrivaled.</p>
 <p>When Mu Qing saw Qing Shui's expression she smiled. Putting aside the Violet Jade Sword, she picked up the box and asked, smiling, "What is this? Is it also for me?"</p>
 <p>"It's for you. Open it and see if you like it." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Why are you giving me a gift?” Mu Qing smiled and looked at Qing Shui, appearing very calm.</p>
