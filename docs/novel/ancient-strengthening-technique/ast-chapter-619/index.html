 <p><strong>AST 619 - Sima Huoyu. The difference between Qing Shui and the youngsters in his generation</strong></p>
 <p>“Sister, actually father is also suffering. Every time when he mentions you, he feels especially upset… When we ask him why, he always refuses to answer. Believe me…” Di Qing looked at Di Chen and explained gently.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s stop talking about this for now, I’ll be heading to Di Clan soon. I only plan to visit some of the places where I used to play when I was young and meet a few of the people who I’m familiar with. I never intended to go back and live there. Since he abandoned me, I have cut off all ties with the Di Clan. I just don’t understand why, as parents, he would be willing to abandon me. That’s what I wanted to ask him.” Di Chen responded with a seemingly relaxed look.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui approached them. Di Qing looked at Qing Shui with a serious expression for quite a while. This made Qing Shui felt a bit nervous as he had not the slightest idea why this gorgeous woman was looking at him.</p>
 <p>Di Qing has also lived with Di Chen in Green Cloud Continent for quite a while. Hence, she understood how Di Chen thought. She was really surprised that Di Chen was serious about heading to Di Clan with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Di Chen had once mentioned bringing an “ideal husband” back to Di Clan to ask her own father why had he treated her like this. She also intended to let them realize just how ridiculous their decision at that time was. Their actions were the reasons that led to the annihilation of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord by Qing Shui, her own husband’s hands.</p>
 <p>During Di Qing’s first trip to the Green Cloud Continent, she was really surprised when she found out that her sister Di Chen liked Qing Shui. She understood her own sister more than anyone else. It’s almost impossible for someone as outstanding as her to fall for a man who was younger and weaker than her.</p>
 <p>Nonetheless, she had never expected the young man that her sister liked to be someone who she had met before. Furthermore, he was someone who she had a deep impression of as well. The reason being that he was a man who was unusually rational and clear-headed.</p>
 <p>Especially the events which happened later on. His determination, persistence, each and every one of his qualities as a man were deeply engraved in her. He was a man with feelings too, the incident which happened at the Flowerfruit Mountain made him feel really sad. As she thought about these, she understood why her sister would fall in love with him.</p>
 <p>Add on the time when she was going back with him to the Central Continent, he accused her of being stupid. Even though it was the first time she got scolded by a man, she wasn’t really upset about it. On the contrary, she felt a bit happy. She knew that the reason why he scolded her wasn’t actually cause he cared about her but the responsibility he felt for her sister. Nevertheless, she still could never forget about him.</p>
 <p>Also the time when she got hugged by him… She had actually felt secure… She wasn’t a licentious woman, nor has she ever been close to any guys throughout her life. She didn’t like the people from aristocratic clans. On top of that, they would usually have more than one wife around them.They’re nothing but a group of fake people. Furthermore, their cultivations level were also nothing compared to hers. Hence, she really despised them.</p>
 <p>Upon meeting Qing Shui, she slowly realized that this man has an excellent moral character despite not being really powerful. It might also have been because her sister liked him that she started paying more attention to him. The features which truly stood out about him were his persistence and personality. Second after that was his tremendous pace at which his strength increased. Very quickly, he has already surpassed both her sister and herself.</p>
 <p>At present, he has even reached a terrifying stage in terms of his cultivation. He was capable of eliminating the entire Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord alone… And he was still so young!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she noticed that someone was pulling her. When she came back to her senses, she realized that both Di Chen and Qing Shui were looking at her in confusion. She on the other hand, she was indulging in looking at Qing Shui. In just a short while, she had already started blushing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked for an excuse to go out to give the two a chance to talk to each other.</p>
 <p>“What’re you thinking about? You seem really into it.” Di Chen smiled humbly and asked Di Qing.</p>
 <p>“Sister, do you really want to marry him?” Di Qing asked Di Chen seriously. Suddenly, she noticed that her own sister was really good at judging people. From the boundless ocean, she actually managed to find a person like Qing Shui. How would she have been able to figure out that the true reason behind it was the dream among the sea of flowers? It’s very similar to the scene when she appeared with Qing Shui except it was more flirtatious when he did it with Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“I support sister, he is barely able to meet sister’s criteria.” Di Qing chuckled.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When they were eating, Di Qing suggested going to eat outside at the hall. Eventually, the three settled down on a spot next to the windows in the living room of a restaurant.</p>
 <p>The sky was already getting darker. However, the lightstones illuminated the entire hall and kept it bright. Qing Shui was on the ninth floor as he looked out through the windows to observe the street that was bustling with activities. The hall was really quiet. The contrast between it and the street made Qing Shui feel really peaceful.</p>
 <p>“Young master! Look here! This place is the most quiet place!”</p>
 <p>A cheerful man’s voice suddenly came through from the stairs.</p>
 <p>Soon after, Qing Shui saw six men coming up one after the other. The leading man was a dark and sturdy looking man. Qing Shui was unable to tell how old he was. He was in between looking young and old and appeared incomparably strong.</p>
 <p>The man was wearing a dark green colored long gown. There was a young man standing beside him. The man was really short and fat. He was approximately one head shorter than the strong man, but was fat enough to be compared to two adult men. In other words, he looked like a meatball.</p>
 <p>Behind the fat man was an old man and a middle-aged man who looked courteous. The remaining two people were women. They had big breasts and wide hips and were wearing revealing clothes.Their beast leather clothes and shorts were really small and short while the beast leather belt was just below their belly. Their legs looked really white and attractive, making them look extremely sexy.</p>
 <p>“Hm, isn’t that the second Young Lady Di?” Upon seeing Di Chen, the dark and sturdy man walked towards them.</p>
 <p>Di Qing turned around and looked at the man: “Sima Huoyu? What are you doing here?”</p>
 <p>“Lady Qing, would you mind introducing me to your friends?” The man immediately sat down on one of the empty stools and started acting really familiar around them.</p>
 <p>Di Qing knitted her brows: “This is the third young master of Sima Clan. Even though Sima Clan isn’t included as one of the Seven Stars, their strength is nothing inferior to them. For now, they are considered to have replaced the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Di Qing was trying to leak him some information about these men.</p>
 <p>The man fixed his sight on Qing Shui.He also looked at Di Chen a few times. During those times, he didn’t try to cover up his reaction of being stunned by Di Chen’s beauty. After that, he moved his sight back to the two sexy women beside him only to find them incomparably plain and ordinary.</p>
 <p>“This is Qing Shui, and this is his wife.” Di Qing responded indifferently.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui? The person who managed to eliminate the entire Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord alone?” At this moment, the man glared at Qing Shui with a fiery expression. Qing Shui could even feel his aura rising.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected himself to already be so popular. It has mentioned before that the younger generations of the sects within Seven Star Country have been really eager to challenge him to a fight.</p>
 <p>“Erm, I think it would be better if you cool down. You are not my opponent. I don’t have time to play with you.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You arrogant fool, how would you know before you even try? Furthermore, it’s only a rumor that you managed to eliminate the Residence of Sky Tyrant Lord by yourself. No one has any idea about what the true situation was.” The man didn’t actually feel angry. He only looked at Qing Shui indifferently.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and shook his head. He stopped talking. He also moved his sight away from the man.</p>
 <p>“What? Could it be that what I said was true?” Sima Huoyu looked at Qing Shui and teased him.</p>
 <p>“Gosh, is fame such an important thing? It’s either fame or death, which one would you prefer?” Qing Shui knitted his brows and looked at Sima Huoyu.</p>
 <p>“Do you think that you can do it?” Sima Huoyu didn’t feel in the least concerned as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Sima Huoyu! Qing Shui is my friend! And one more thing, you can leave now. We still have things that we need to talk about.” Di Qing never expected for Sima Huoyu to react so dramatically.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Sima Huoyu with a smile. After that, he extended his hand and swiftly gestured towards Sima Huoyu and glided out of the enormous window.</p>
 <p>Sima Huoyu did exactly what Qing Shui did and followed him closely. After that, the two soared all the way up into the sky. The old man and middle-aged courteous man also followed from behind.</p>
 <p>Both Di Chen and Di Qing looked from afar on top of the Blue Luan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rapidly dashed towards Sima Huoyu and opened up his right palm.</p>
 <p>Tiger Laceration!</p>
 <p>The movement of Qing Shui’s arms might seem really slow but people with discerning eyes would be able to tell that his attacks were really fierce and powerful. It was exactly as confucius said: “to have accumulated knowledge and deliver it slowly”. It was something that could only be drawn out with powerful energy. It was a very ordinary skill, yet it was able to make people feel like they were standing in front of a fierce and enormous Demonic Beast.</p>
 <p>Sima Huoyu couldn’t afford to slow down. He quickly punched Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>A dull colliding noise rang. It sounded just like when two enormous stones collided with each other.</p>
 <p>This was only Qing Shui’s raw physical strength. He also added in the skill Immovable as Mountains. Hence, it was worth about four hundred countries. Qing Shui was relying on the sturdiness of his physical body and the Tiger Form to suppress his opponent.</p>
 <p>The two immediately bounced back from each other as soon as they collided. Qing Shui wasn’t really surprised by it. Simultaneously, he had also gotten a grasp of his opponent’s strength. He was a fourth grade Martial Saint. No wonder he was so cocky. He was actually qualified to be so. Among the younger generations, a person who managed to achieve fourth grade Martial Saints was already considered to be really outstanding and talented. As for the incident about Qing Shui eliminating the entire Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, it was just a rumor, let alone that the strongest warrior in Residence of Sky Tyrant Lord was rumored to only be at fourth grade Martial Saint. From this incident, Qing Shui suspected that the Seven Stars might not be the strongest sects in Seven Stars Country. Just because they were famous, it didn’t necessarily mean that they’re the best.</p>
 <p>Hence, Sima Huoyu didn’t see Qing Shui as such a formidable opponent. Upon hearing that Qing Shui was from Green Cloud Continent, he has always wanted to defeat Qing Shui. If the situation was worse than he thought, he would still at least be able to defend himself. Hence, he thought that it was a really good thing because in any case, it wouldn’t result in any loss to him.</p>
 <p>“So this is the best you can do? Try this one for size!” Sima Huoyu let out a huge scream while looking at Qing Shui. Now he was feeling even more confident that he could beat him.</p>
 <p>After finished speaking, he threw himself at Qing Shui as he attempted to punch him. This punch felt really firm and strong. His entire fist looked red hot like a heated iron, it was giving out a threatening and scorching aura.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Taichi Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>It was yet another dull colliding noise. Just like before, the two once again bounced back from each other.</p>
 <p>“Hah!”</p>
 <p>Sima Huoyu let out another huge scream. After that, a threatening aura started emerging from his body. He crossed both of his fists and once again attempted to rush into Qing Shui. This time, he was giving off an enormous aura. This was his all-out</p>
 <p>Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>He used the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p>Sima Huoyu was immediately weakened by around six hundred countries worth of strength.. Qing Shui on the other hand, he currently possessed the fourth grade Nature Energy and third grade Immovable Mountains. Even without the Violet Gold Divine Shield, Big Dipper Sword or the Heavenly Talisman, he still had at least six hundred and fifty countries worth of strength, slightly more than the amount of strength which got reduced off Sima Huoyu.</p>
 <p>The Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm has now achieved the Fifth Wave. For someone who was equal in strength with Qing Shui, he definitely wouldn’t be able to take on such a powerful Wave Essence. Without a powerful physical strength, it was already really exhausting to defend against the second wave, let alone the five waves! In front of Qing Shui’s Sword of Fifth Wave, even Third Master Dongguo’s sixth grade weapons would shatter. From this, one could already tell just how powerful the Wave Essence was.</p>
 <p>Sima Huoyu immediately spat out a mouthful of blood and got blasted backwards. Not to mention that Qing Shui was just doing it bare-handed. Sima Huoyu still had a considerably strong physique, or else, it would have been a question if he would still be alive. In addition to that, Qing Shui went easy on him.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man from behind dashed to the front of him like a demon and grabbed Sima Huoyu. He also quickly took out a medicinal pill and fed it to him.</p>
 <p>“Thanks for showing mercy. We will meet again.” The man spoke while cupping his hands in obeisance. After that, he left with the other people.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you kill him?” Di Chen asked Qing Shui as she approached him with the Blue Luan.</p>
 <p>“It’s not the time yet. Furthermore, I don’t find it necessary to kill him.” For a moment, Qing Shui was startled. After that, he glanced towards Di Qing and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you need to be careful of this Sima Clan. It may not be considered one of the Seven Stars but the Seven Stars aren’t necessarily the strongest groups within the Seven Stars Country. According to rumors, Sima Clan shared a close relationship with Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, Sima Clan also specializes in using poison, they might even be a part of Ten Thousand Poisons Sect!</p>
