This was a weapon that looked both like a long fan and a flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was in a shiny brilliant gold, exuding pure spiritual Qi waves. Through Huang Wu's identity, Qing Shui knew that the weapon he possessed was definitely a good one. However, no matter how good it was, it was still slightly worse when compared to his own Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You better watch out!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Wu reminded Qing Shui before charging out toward him. His speed wasn't fast but the places he had passed by had something like sand rising up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yellow Sand Ten Thousand Miles!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that Huang Wu seemed to not have sufficient mastery of this skill. It was said that when the Yellow Sand Ten Thousand Miles was cultivated to the peak, it could instantly turn an area within 10,000 li or even further into a desert, wiping out all living creatures in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This technique was truly vicious, but the real Yellow Sand Ten Thousand Miles had only been used in the ancient times before. No one had seen it in recent years. Even with that said, when dealing with experts, the prowess of this attack wasn't very strong. This was a powerful Sure Kill Technique in large-scale battles such as those between dynasties or sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were not the only effects that the Yellow Sand Ten Thousand Miles had. The area within the sand was also his territory and within this domain, his abilities would get stronger. It was also more beneficial for him when performing some of his battle techniques as the domain would also increase some of his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huang Wu was only considered to have achieved a small success stage in this, the effect was still very great. In this ocean domain, the surroundings seemed to have been turned into a small-scale desert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui was aware that this wasn't a real desert. It was only formed by a type of Origin Qi and was only temporary. However, the stronger one was, the longer the effects could be sustained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sand filled up the entire place and Qing Shui could sense that Huang Wu was getting stronger while his own body was being restricted. However, very soon, Qing Shui realized that the Nine Yang Force within his body was exuding a powerful and domineering force that had instantly cleared off the feeling from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn't help but smile. The Nine Yang Dragon Soul was truly amazing. Furthermore, Qing Shui felt that it was related to his Nine Yang Golden Body. The Nine Yang Dragon Soul seemed to have already been merged into his physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A surge of domineering force in his Dantian flowed through his meridian channels right into his eight extra vessels, his twelve channels, as well as his heavenly meridians and earthly meridians. In that instant, it was as if all of them had merged into one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only had the Nine Yang Dragon Soul merged all of this together, it even merged into his physique. Qing Shui didn't have the chance to appreciate it when something even more unbelievable happened to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Yang Dragon Soul went gushing out toward the paragon vessel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Nine Yang Dragon Soul wasn't an actual soul, it was a mental intent that was formed from a combination of Qing Shui's thought and his techniques. It was like a primordial spirit existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a slight collision and the Nine Yang Dragon Soul which had just clashed into the paragon vessel was thrown off. It seemed that the paragon vessel didn't welcome the Nine Yang Dragon Soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled bitterly. This Nine Yang Dragon Soul was really aggressive. It wasn't satisfied with just merging into his body and consciousness. It wanted to spread its influence even more by taking over the paragon vessel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't know if this was a good sign or a bad sign, but he knew that the paragon vessel was no pushover. Moreover, the Nine Yang Dragon Soul was something that Qing Shui had control over. It was just that there may be times when he might not be able to contain this overwhelming force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In actuality, there was no need for Qing Shui to be worried. All three intents in his body were all him. The paragon vessel's intent was him, and the Nine Yang Dragon Soul was even more so. Although all of them were him, they were usually independent. Qing Shui had the choice to control them as he wished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was actually thinking that it wouldn't be bad to let the Nine Yang Dragon Soul control the paragon vessel. It was also why he hadn't tried to stop it earlier. He even wanted to see what the outcome would be like for the Nine Yang Dragon Soul to be merged together with the paragon vessel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it seemed like it wasn't that simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Windsand Fury!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Wu swung the "long fan" he was holding and something that was akin to a huge sand pillar, that seemed to be both material and also a little shaky, spun violently and went charging toward Qing Shui like a sand dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wind was blowing and the sand was bellowing. It was like a devil that was made of sand, opening its terrifying large mouth and seeming as if it wanted to engulf Qing Shui entirely. This kind of sand had an extremely high temperature and a powerful engulfing force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The legacies of the Wavemoon Cavern's Huang Clan was such sand that could engulf, had poison that could seep through, was sturdy, and scorching...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't have a good idea of how to deal with this sand dragon. It was like in a situation where someone threw a bucket of feces in your direction. You would be at a loss of whether you should block or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, Qing Shui had the Nine Continents Mountain. The Nine Continents Mountain, which was 100 meters in size, was the best at dealing with such things. It wasn't that effective in dealing with soul-based attacks but was still very useful when dealing with physical attacks like these.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't that Qing Shui couldn't use his Origin Qi to create a barrier. He just simply wanted to try the sand dragon's prowess with the Nine Continents Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Continents Mountain's prowess had increased a lot more from what it was before. The several folds increment kept it from being on the losing end when dealing with this sand dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi zi...</span></p>

It was piercing and intolerable. The sound seemed as if it wanted to tear a person apart and the surroundings had already become a vacuum state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The land under everyone's feet that was within sight was now covered in thick layers of sand.</span></p>

Qing Shui stared at Huang Wu who was opposite him and saw that the opponent hadn't been struck by the effects of the Mighty Elephant Stomp.</span></p>

Huang Wu didn't hesitate and struck out his long fan like a sword toward Qing Shui. The action was strange but profound.</span></p>

It would cause him to be overly reliant on them. Therefore, if he could handle the situation by himself, he wouldn't use the Emperor's Qi to assist him.</span></p>

Furthermore, it was fiercely and stronger. Before great power, everything else was useless. Moreover, Qing Shui didn't merely just have power. He was clearly more than a notch higher than Huang Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's strength had increased multiple folds within a short period of time and if would be astonishing if he wasn't already stronger than Huang Wu. If that was the case, then Huang Wu wasn't an existence that could be described with only the word 'genius'.</span></p>

Qing Shui didn't budge, but Huang Wu retreated rapidly. He had only taken two steps back before he was sent flying out, his chest undulating very strongly.</span></p>

He didn't wish to kill Huang Wu. He didn't wish to fall out with the Watermoon Cavern right now. Thus, he chose to hold back. The Huang Wu's abilities should be about the same if not weaker compared to before Qing Shui's Nine Yang Dragon Soul had reached the small success stage.</span></p>

However, at Huang Wu's current age, he was definitely at the top amongst those of his age. There were very few who were like him even in influences at the level of the Wavemoon Cavern and Watermoon Cavern. Even an influence of that level wouldn't be able to produce many of Huang Wu's level.</span></p>
