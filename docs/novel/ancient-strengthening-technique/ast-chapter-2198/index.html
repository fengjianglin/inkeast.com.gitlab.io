Seeing that he had finally got what he wanted, she then said happily: “This is great! You’ve found the Lightning Fruit!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I may have found it, but whether I can use it or not is another question.” Qing Shui actually didn’t have much confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What would you be using the Lightning Fruit for? To make medicine?” Beihuang Fan took a guess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice job, you are correct! Do you want me to reward you with an embrace?” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No thank you!” Beihuang Fan said immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? I see. The most I can give then is a kiss. Any more wouldn’t be allowed. I am a man of principle. Unless you beg me earnestly and make my heart go soft and to your whim, only then can you do whatever you want with me…” Qing Shui sounded happier and happier as he continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up!” Beihuang Fan couldn’t take it. This guy would go that far? She barely said anything, but he then returned with this pile of words. What was even going on in his head?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at this beautiful woman without a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, you really treat me too well. I definitely owe you my life.” Beihuang Fan went over happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then Beihuang Fan gave an embarrassed smile, “Hehe, I won’t let you get it though…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure, you really are a cute one. You’re even a part of the Chrysanthemun (asshole) Clan.” Qing Shui knew Beihuang Fan was kidding, but he couldn’t resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan didn’t know what to say now. Beihuang Yu used to be definitely the callous type, as the young master of the Taiyi Immortal Palace, who led many young men, some even copying him. He was not like this. Those who were near ink do turn black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu didn’t really care right now, he was simply very happy, and didn’t really care this time. His total strength increase was too much compared to what he had thought he’d get. He was just looking at the remaining three monsters, who were in their infancy, without a way to sustain themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should I do with those three? Shall I let them decide their fates for themselves?” Beihuang Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He obtained an edge from the few of them, which was why he didn’t really want to just leave them out to fend for themselves. Now that the Bloodthirst Spirit Bear had started to gain intelligence and also started to gain some of its wishes, he hoped that they would continue to live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu was now in a panic whereas Qing Shui shook his head:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Alright, I’ll help you. I’ll put them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a function that was obtained a while after. He couldn’t bring people nor demonic beasts into the Realm, but he could bring dead ones, fish types, and the spawn of beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, he could bring a brand that would signify that the realm was his as though it were a special number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, having a brand didn’t mean that it would automatically treat it as its master, so this didn’t matter much to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation could be seen as a wrap, finding the nests of the two large beasts, which was the nest of the Bloodthirst Spirit Bear. Unfortunately, it didn’t match up to that of the Diamond White Tiger King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another week passed without incident, and Qing Shui and his crew had been staying there for that long, or maybe went forward a bit, but couldn’t find anything. Besides, they could no longer advance since the group of demonic beasts had become too strong. If it were just one or two of them, Qing Shui could defeat them, but since they were in a group, too many to count and not much weaker than the Bloodthirst Spirit Bear’s father and mother with some being even stronger, it would be fruitless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, they decided to return. They didn’t have much time anyways, and should return. All in all, they had been out for half a month, and could hold the door for four hours only. If they missed their shot, they would have to stay for 500 years and had to wait for it to open again before they could leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t want to think about staying here for 500 years. However, there were still some things that bothered him. Since this area was under the Yu Royal Gate, it was also their world. There were many different types of things here, but no people. It should also be very large, enough that trying to estimate would be hard, but if there were cities here then it would be much different than the old world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for how far this world and the Nine Continents were from each other, it would appear that this was a part of the Nine Continents. Perhaps, it was some random area, like somewhere in the Haohan Continent, or maybe it was a separate world from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, not wanting to ponder such things, and led everyone back to the portal to go through it together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, there was about a day’s worth of travel before they got to the portal, and they weren’t able to leave until noon of the next day. Therefore, they had the perfect amount of time to travel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when they arrived, they found that there were already a good amount of people there. At the same time, Qing Shui said that coming back the next day would be fine since they had the Nine Continents Step, which others did not. Some had waited for three, four, or even five days to be able to leave, or tried their hand at luck, and didn’t dare go too far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’ve come out.” At this moment, a sound reached their ears, and Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw a group of people looking at him. At first, he didn’t recognize them, but then he noticed someone he knew, Lie Yanglie. The person who had his teeth beaten out by Beihuang Fan, who was also a member of the Blazing Sun Immortal Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A group of people, almost thirty, came in front of Qing Shui, and he saw another person that he knew. It was the old person in red, who was called Miao Yonglong if he remembered correctly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this time he was standing behind a middle-aged person. Miao Yonglong was an important person, but the person he was standing behind of appeared even more so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Daughter of Beihuang’s head, you attacked my child. Now I will give you two choices.” The man immediately said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan didn’t say anything and wrinkled her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First, I’ll have you remain here forever. The second option is for you to wed my son. Choose wisely.” The man said without haste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought that it was very funny, but no one else did. The reason was that the person speaking was the father of Lie Yanglie, Lie Hunren, and the Palace head of the Blazing Sun Immortal Palace. He was a legendary presence, his strength unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We choose the third,” Qing Shui said matter-of-factly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There isn’t one.” The man replied, also as if it were common sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I say there is. The third is that you will move unless you want to die.” Qing Shui smiled, gazing at Lie Hunren.</span></p>

In all his years, no one had dared talk to him like that. It really was the folly of the young who didn’t know their place.</span></p>

At first, I thought that you guys were something important, now that I know that the kid is yours I am puzzled. They say that a tiger as a father will have no dogs as his children. I really had no idea that this was your child, and now you’re coming out here with a request that is contrary to saving face. That made me think that you are only scum.” Qing Shui said with a strong tone.</span></p>

This guy, Qing Shui, would dare say that his woman brought up his child in this way, and then say that he was scum? Although he wasn’t that angry, he needed Qing Shui to shut up, and the best way to do it was to teach him a lesson through fists.</span></p>
