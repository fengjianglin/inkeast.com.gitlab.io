He smiled and walked toward Qin Qing and said, “My wife, your husband has beaten them. No one will dare to bully you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators maintained a safe distance to watch the situation unfold when they saw people fought here. They seemed to be discussing something too. Qing Shui’s hearing was exceptional. He could hear what those people were saying quite clearly too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It would be great if he can kill these people. It will be quiet and tranquil around here then.”</span></p>

Those people are tyrannical. I pity my granddaughter - she was killed by these same people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The good will be rewarded and the bad will be punished. Is this really a punishment for the evil this time? I really hope the gods have finally opened their eyes and punish them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qin Qing heard Qing Shui’s words, she gave him a stare that seemed happy yet displeased at the same time before she walked away. Even though this incident was insignificant, it still had an effect on everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Qing Shui left, he told the crowd that these people had been crippled to the point of being without a cultivation base, and they would not bully or hurt people anymore. He wanted everyone to know that they don’t need to be afraid of them any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though these people didn’t know what kind of person Qing Shui and Qin Qing were, they knew that the evil in this area had been exterminated. However, Qing Shui was well aware that other criminals would eventually show up even if these people had been defeated. In spite of that, Qing Shui felt there was no need for him to interfere with these things anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he had encountered this matter during his visit, he didn’t mind lending out a hand to help them. Besides, these people had actually tried to plan something against him. Weren’t they asking for trouble by doing so?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t kill them. They were just some small bunch of criminals. Although some of them had a cultivation base that was considered to be strong in this area, Qing Shui couldn’t make sense of the situation. Brother Gou’s power was sufficient enough to create a powerful family clan in the Moonlight City. There was no need for them to come out as arrogant and presumptuous…. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be honest, Qing Shui wasn’t aware that Brother Gou had gotten an unexpected encounter this time. His natural characteristic was that of a quack and a hooligan. Even though he had some power, he liked that sort of style, which was much more arrogant than it was before. His behavior was that of a poor man, who would be anxious about his meal every day, but when he had money all of the sudden, he would buy a lot of rice and steamed buns. He didn’t even think of buying fishes or meat to satisfy his hunger….. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They would have to blame themselves for being unlucky. They were destined to end up in this misfortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Qin Qing strolled for one round and went back to the inn. The inn was average, yet it was considered to be on a decent ranking in the Moonlight City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lot of people were having supper in here. Qing Shui suggested that they should have supper as well while stargazing in the night sky at the main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing nodded her head. Both of them then sat down on the seats next to the window. After a while, a waitress came to serve them while carrying their dishes on a decorative tray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss, I would like to inquire you about something. Do you know why this city is called Moonlight City?” Qing Shui asked the waitress as she was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, everyone here knows about it. The reason for your question is that this city is next to Moonlight Mountain.” The waitress replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about Moonlight Mountain? Is it famous?” Qing Shui randomly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Moonlight Mountain isn’t really famous, but it’s well-known for this part of the area. The mountain is filled with ferocious wild beasts, and it is said that there are some Moonlight Trees growing on the mountain as well. The trees are sparkly and snow-white in color and they are quite beautiful. A few drops of dew will appear on top of those trees too. They are called Moonlight Dew. Wild beasts will become more violent after eating those things. Moreover, the dews can be used as medicine to treat illness. The uses for these dews are aplenty, but the amount you can get is quite scarce.” The waitress explained patiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonlight Dew. Qing Shui was stunned. He had an impression of this thing and based on his memory, Moonlight Dew had the ability to increase the cultivation base of demonic beasts. He wasn’t sure whether the Moonlight Dew in this place has the same ability to do so. But as he listened to the waitress’ explanation, he felt that it would be possible with the Moonlight Dew here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the waitress had left, Qing Shui beamed, “Come with me to Moonlight Mountain and have a look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” Qin Qing briskly agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing would normally talk with a few words, but occasionally, she would speak more than that. Sometimes, she would be stunningly cold, but at times, she would be like a vixen. However, Qing Shui was afraid to go closer to her when she was like that. She was simply was an unfathomable woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they had supper, both of them left the inn and flew straight to Moonlight Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonlight Mountain wasn’t restricted for entry. People would make a living according to the given circumstances. This Moonlight Mountain had brought an imponderable wealth to the Moonlight City. One could say that half of the population in the Moonlight City was raised through their reliance on Moonlight Mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them managed to rush to Moonlight Mountain. The moon in the night sky illuminated the entire land like snow as if the ground had been draped with a snow-white layer of silver silk. This was a feeling of unspeakable pureness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps because it was already night time, he was able to feel a faint coldness penetrating his skin. It felt quite comfortable. There was only one entrance to Moonlight Mountain in this borderland. This place was very quiet as they could only hear the singing of the insects around the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sparkling snow-white Moonlight Trees should be easy to find. However, that woman said these things were valuable, and these trees would normally be found in the deeper areas of the mountain. Qing Shui immediately released his Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than the extreme lethality of the Dragon Slaying Beast, it was also well-equipped with the ability of the Treasure Hunting Pig to seek treasures. He believed that this demonic beast should be able to lead him to find the Moonlight Trees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took Qin Qing and used the Nine Continents Steps immediately, appearing at the deeper parts of the Moonlight Mountains in an instant. The temperature in this area was lower than that at the borderland. At least the dripping water in this place could definitely be turned into icicles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the weather being this cold, could there possibly be dews formed on the tree? However, when he remembered that the dew wasn’t some sort of ordinary dew, he understood immediately. It should be possible to find those dews.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them strolled through the mountains and searched around for the Moonlight Tree. Instantaneously, there were able to spot one. With one look at the tree, they were able to confirm that this was the Moonlight Tree they had been looking for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Moonlight Tree wasn’t that tall. The height of it was as tall as a human being. The tree was snow-white in color as if it had been covered in a layer of snow. It was filled with luscious leaves as well, yet the size of the foliage could only extend to about less than two meters apart. In spite of that, the tree itself was quite beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used his Heavenly Vision Technique to analyze the tree!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonlight Tree, hundred years of age!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On top of the tree was a layer of densely packed dews. Qing Shui took a look once again and knew in an instant that this type of dew was more suitable to be used by ordinary humans and ordinary wild beasts. The effectiveness of the dew was considered great, but if demonic beasts and humans with stronger power were to use the dew, it would be useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui finally understood the importance of the relationship between the dew of the Moonlight Tree and the age of the tree itself. The older the tree was, the more precious the Moonlight Dew would be. When Qing Shui realized this fact, he was extremely happy. He had the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and the Earth Divine Stone too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly made his move and removed the soil surrounding the Moonlight Tree before moving the tree and planted it inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Qin Qing was already used to this sort of behavior from Qing Shui. Last time, the Diamond Fruit Tree was ‘relocated’ as well. As for where he had planted the tree or whether he did plant the tree, she had no idea about it, and she didn’t inquire about that either because if Qing Shui did not explain to her, then he wouldn’t tell her even if she did ask about the tree. Regardless, she decided that she would not ask about it no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he continued to search for more Moonlight Trees in this area. Qing Shui also realized that the age of the Moonlight Trees in this part of the mountain wasn’t that great. Five hundred years was considered great. Once the Moonlight Tree had reached the age of five hundred years, its lifespan would have reached its very end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Plants have lifespans and they would die as well. After they had matured, their absorption capability would be weaker. If there wasn’t any special abnormally and nourishment present, the plants would not be able to break through the previously mentioned mark. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Medicinal herbs and plants were also categorized into grades as well. Only those that were able to break through their current grade would be able to acquire a longer lifespan. In his previous life, the Cypress Pine had a long lifespan. Only when this Moonlight Tree had broken through to its current breakthrough would it be able to have a lifespan of more than 500 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The number of Moonlight Trees in this Moonlight Mountain wasn’t much, yet aplenty. Qing Shui didn’t manage to find a Moonlight Tree of 500 years old. The best he could find was around 300 years old, which was the age that the trees were able to live through easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was now even more spacious. The uncultivated land was vast, which was why it took him until daybreak to be able to fit in about one hundred trees before he stopped. It was only around this time that Qin Qing finally expressed her shock as she fixed her gaze at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One hundred of these trees would require a lot of spaces, yet she did not ask anything about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was able to tell that Qin Qing was flabbergasted. He smiled, “I have a treasure that only I know. Are you curious about that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure you are not curious?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Curiosity will only lead to disadvantages, not benefits. So this is why I am able to resist my own curiosity.” Qin Qing beamingly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The both of them left directly from the Moonlight Mountain and continued onward to the Great Qin Dynasty. The distance from here to the Great Qin Dynasty was quite far indeed. Their current schedule was to rush their journey during the day while riding on Hellfire Phoenix and set up a tent to rest at night, or to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is the Great Qin Dynasty strong?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How should I say this..., it depends on who they fight with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are there any Divine cultivators?” Qing Shui continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I really don’t know. I don’t have a concrete answer for you. I’ve only heard rumors, and some say there is while others say there aren’t any. I am not sure if there’s one either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not probe her further. He knew that Qin Qing was telling the truth. On the other hand, he knew that the disparity of power between Peak False God and Divine realm was too great. The realm of Divine wouldn’t be that easy to reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing has become quite proficient in her current Phoenix Finger as well. Moreover, she had actually integrated her Phoenix Finger with some of the battle techniques from her Phoenix Battle God Inheritance, allowing her skill to become a lot stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had never actually seen Qin Qing using the battle techniques from her Phoenix Battle God Inheritance. Her cultivation was extraordinary, especially her Phoenix Dance Steps and some of her Phoenix Techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of the Phoenix was as fast as that of the roc. Compared to that of a dragon, the Phoenix was much faster as its specialty was its speed. Qin Qing’s speed was extraordinarily fast too, quite comparable to Qing Shui’s current speed, or perhaps even stronger than his. However, Qing Shui has the Emperor’s Qi and Art of Pursuing to back him up. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, both of them hadn’t talked about their family for a very long time. Qin Qing only knew that Qing Shui came to Haohan Continent from other external regions. He was a miraculous physician too. On the other hand, Qing Shui knew the Qin Qing was a member of the Great Qin Dynasty. She seemed to have a powerful status in the Ice Domain Dynasty as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed by unconsciously. The distance to the Great Qin Dynasty was getting closer. In about a week’s time, they would be able to reach their destination. For now, they were still at the Sacred Might Dynasty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sacred Might Dynasty was a considerably large dynasty. Compared to Ice Domain Dynasty, Sacred Might Dynasty was much stronger. The region of this dynasty was quite large. They had already entered this dynasty for about a week and they would be passing through the region soon. Below them, however, was the imperial city of the Sacred Might Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when both of them were prepared to go down stay for the night, a large black dragon suddenly appeared in the sky and blocked their path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black Dragon. This was Qing Shui’s first time seeing one. It was as black as ink, and its eyes were blood red in color. According to the legends, Black Dragon was also known as Demon Dragon, a wicked presence amongst the species of dragons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Black Dragon was about 500 meters in length, and it was extremely muscular. An air of nether cold aura was emitted by this dragon. Its blood red eyes were exceedingly vicious. This was a real dragon species. Qing Shui didn’t even think he would be able to meet a dragon in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed like dragons were beginning to appear in this region. When he thought about seeing the large blue dragon in his telepathic communication, he assumed that Qin Qing’s true form should be that of the dragon he saw. But what about now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui observed Qin Qing beside him. There were no changes, no disdain nor panic in her expression when she gazed at the dragon in front of her. There was only calmness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing with about 20 people, they all seemed to be men and women of young age, as well as two old men amongst them.</span></p>
