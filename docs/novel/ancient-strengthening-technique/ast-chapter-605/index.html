 <p><strong>AST 605 - Wang Clan As A Stepping Stone, Di Chen’s Intention (3)</strong></p>
 <p>Di Chen was one of the few!</p>
 <p>He knew of Di Chen’s loneliness as well as the dreams that she held. Qing Shui was afraid that he would not be able to give her happiness. If Qing Shui was sure about being able to give her happiness, he would absolutely not mind being together with her because Qing Shui would love her a lot.</p>
 <p>However, he now knew about Di Chen’s determination, thus Qing Shui held her hands. Although it was a simple action, he had hesitated for a long time.</p>
 <p>After he made that decision and held her hands, Qing Shui decided to never let her go. Qing Shui was very sure of her intentions, he had already reminded her how he had multiple women. Since she was able to accept that, then Qing Shui would not be bothered about the other details anymore.</p>
 <p>This attitude of Qing Shui stemmed from the deeply ingrained concept of monogamy from his previous life. However, in the World of the Nine Continents, monogamy was an indication of weakness.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui thought back to his previous life, he realized that it was actually the same as well. Those with power and money were able to have multiple wives or mistresses, some were even able to have multiple identities and openly have a few families in different places. They would travel around multiple times, alternating between different women and their families.</p>
 <p>In the World of the Nine Continents, such a system was very normal and open, especially for those with strength!</p>
 <p>He shook his head and stopped thinking about it, such fairy-like women, he had come across multiple times. He had not only saved them and he had even humbled himself before them. However, he was just controlling himself, it was not that he did not like or love them.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui loved her, his motivations for doing so were not important, whether be it out of gratefulness, beauty or even a simple and pure love. There was no such thing as love without any reason, the most important encounter that Qing Shui had with her was the time he first met her in the in the dream when he was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. She was the one that caused the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to break through to the fifth level, she also led him to his breakthrough, saving his life as a result. From that moment, Qing Shui had loved this woman even though he didn’t know whether she existed or not.</p>
 <p>Since he loved her, then why was there a need to restrain himself? He should fight for her affection with all his might, to give her happiness with everything he had. She had already lived a tough live, thus Qing Shui was very careful with her.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Before entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui let out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Qing Shui was connected to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, thus if anything happened outside, he would know immediately via the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already refined the Meridians Strengthening Pellet the previous time, it was a pity that they didn’t strengthen the eight major meridians and only strengthened the minor ones. He had never thought of it in the past, only when the recipe to be unlock was the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet, then only he remembered about it.</p>
 <p>Back then, he saw that the required grade of the ingredients for the Meridians Strengthening Pellet was low, the best ingredient grade required was only a thousand years. When he noticed that, he did not pay much attention to it, up until he finally refined them. He had fiddled around with it for half a day before finally refining it, he was happy with the results at that moment.</p>
 <p>He managed to refine 20 pills at that time, this lead Qing Shui to feel that this Meridians Strengthening Pellet did not have much of a strong effect. The description of the effects of the recipe was very vague, it just said ‘strengthening of meridians’.</p>
 <p>Only after consuming one would Qing Shui know that it referred to those tiny minor meridians. However, 99% of people had not even opened those meridians, thus, it would naturally not be strengthened.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of Mingyou Gelou, this pill was practically invented for her!</p>
 <p>After taking a pill, the effects were very minor. Soon, Qing Shui swallowed all twenty pills and the minor meridians in his body became slightly bigger and tougher.</p>
 <p>The effects weren’t too bad, some techniques used these minor meridians, if these minor meridians were not strong enough, it would be very dangerous. Therefore, many people chose not to use those minor meridians and used the major meridians instead. However, this would cause the might of their techniques to be decreased.</p>
 <p>In a way, this was fairness!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui intended to refine more, aside from keeping them for his own use, he was also refining them for Mingyue Gelou and the others. Although the effects were small, but to people who had opened these minor meridians, the effects were significant, they could use quantity to make up for the quality of the effects.</p>
 <p>After exiting the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui was not sleepy despite it being in the middle of the night.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was a sharp bird cry.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head then headed outside, he directly went to the roof and look at the approaching white dot in the distance.</p>
 <p>Snow Monarch Falcon!</p>
 <p>“Looks like the Wang Clan had not given up yet!” Qing Shui smiled as he looked into the distance.</p>
 <p>There were the sounds of footsteps from behind him, without looking behind, Qing Shui knew that it was Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“They are coming!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen walked to Qing Shui’s side and gently said.</p>
 <p>“En, since they are so imprudent then there is no need for me to be merciful.” Qing Shui looked at Di Chen then he looked back at in the direction of the approaching Wang Clan.</p>
 <p>“You must be careful.”</p>
 <p>“I will not die before guaranteeing your safety, even if I die, I will drag them with me.” Qing Shui smiled as he looked into the distance, his words seemed very casual but Di Chen could felt these words came from his heart. She felt warm in her heart but she did not say anything.</p>
 <p>The high pitched falcon cry caused many people to wake up, Lan Tong, Tian Yuan, and the others came out as well. They had a grim expression on their face as they looked at Qing Shui and Di Chen on the roof, they looked quite embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“You guys stay here and don’t move.” After Qing Shui said that, he immediately Skywalked and quickly advanced forward, welcoming that huge Snow Monarch Falcon.</p>
 <p>When he was close, Qing Shui could clearly see the Snow Monarch Falco. Its wingspan was about 80 meters, it could be considered a huge flying beast, the feathers were snow-white but its mouth, eyes, and feet were scarlet.</p>
 <p>Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon!</p>
 <p>This was the king of the Snow Monarch Falcons, it was a Martial Saint leveled Demonic Beast! However, it was only had the strength of a Grade Two Martial Saint, its strength should be about equivalent to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>On the back of the Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon stood five old men dressed in red robes. The one leading them had a red face, his eyes were radiant and he gave an impression similar to that of a sly merchant.</p>
 <p>The other four people stood behind this old man, their eyes were squinted in a calm and composed manner!</p>
 <p>“You must be Qing Shui from the Greencloud Continent, when the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord went to the Greencloud Continent, they were destroyed by you right?” The old man leading them said slowly to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned, “What do you mean by saying that? Are you threatening me?”</p>
 <p>“I am curious when did the Greencloud Continent have a genius like you? Also it is said that without the efforts of more than ten generations of people, it would not be possible to establish a big clan, what do you think?” the old man was about 100 meters away from Qing Shui and as he said that he had an expression that was like a smile yet not a smile.</p>
 <p>“Do you mean to say that the Wang Clan is a big clan?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“Within the Jade Sea Country Capital City, my Wang Clan may not be the top but it is still a big clan that has some prestige. The other clans within the Jade Sea Country Capital City have a good relationship with my Wang Clan. Do you think that you can deal with us on your own using just brute force?” The old man slowly said.</p>
 <p>When he finished saying that, there was the sound of flying beast coming from the distance. Just counting those within his vision, Qing Shui could see about ten flying beasts.</p>
 <p>“You really think highly of me.” Qing Shui did not expect such a result, he felt a little uneasy in his heart.</p>
 <p>“People who reached my age need to be cautious, we are different from you young reckless people. The pride of the Wang Clan have to be reclaimed from you, we needed to be assured of our victory.” The old man said indifferently.</p>
 <p>From every direction came more than ten people, soon, they surrounded Qing Shui. They were all riding on Martial Saint leveled Demonic Beasts. Although they were just grade one or grade two, they were flying beasts, making it even more remarkable.</p>
 <p>When Martial Saint Flying Beasts were compared with normal Martial Saint Demonic beasts, their flying abilities were faster and they had better endurance, this was due to their natural abilities.</p>
 <p>“I wonder if you are the strongest individual in the Wang Clan?” Qing Shui asked as he watched the surrounding reinforcements greet the old man.</p>
 <p>“Brother Wang, is this the person from the Greencloud Continent? So young?” said a tall, robust and powerful man.</p>
 <p>“Brother Luo, do not belittle him, that worthless son of mine was killed by him in one move.” There was a trace of hatred in his voice.</p>
 <p>“Brother Wang, there is no need to be courteous with him, we should just directly chop him into pieces.” the robust man who looked like a hoodlum cautiously looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned hatefully, if the others thought this way as well, then Qing Shui felt that he would have no way to resist. Furthermore, they’re people with some reputation in the Jade Sea Country Capital City.</p>
 <p>“Luo Bin, your Luo Clan can be that shameless but my Li Clan cannot.” Said a skinny old man in the distance riding on a Twin Headed Sparrowhawk.</p>
 <p>“Old Man Li, we are here today to support Old Man Wang, put down the grudge between you and the Luo Clan first.” said a short and black old man riding on a Golden Tailed Wind Feathered Condor beside the Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Big Dipper Sword. He circulated his strength to its peak, however, he was still worried. He could not calm his heart down.</p>
 <p>“Alright, listen to me, let us all attack together and deal with this kid, consider it as I, Wang Delong, owing everyone a favor. Let’s attack!” the Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon flapped its wings and rushed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Chacha!</p>
 <p>A sharp cry resounded!</p>
 <p>A huge Golden Tailed Sparrow appeared from the distance.</p>
 <p>There was an abrupt sound and the Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon stopped. Within a blink of an eye, the Golden Tailed Sparrow arrived in the vicinity of everyone, the old man on the Golden Tailed Sparrow was Nian Yuyang.</p>
 <p>“Nian Yuyang, why are you here?” Qing Shui smiled and greeted him.</p>
 <p>“With your current situation, can I not show up?” Nian Yuyang casually said.</p>
 <p>“Nian Yuyang, do you really think that you can afford to offend my Wang Clan? Do you really think that you can save this kid?” Wang Delong looked at Nian Yuyang and viciously said, both his fists were clenched.</p>
 <p>“I just could not bare to see so many shameless people beating up a junior. If this matter is spread, then the people of Jade Sea Country would no longer dare to leave the Jade Sea Country.” Nian Yuyang laughed loudly, it seemed as if he already had a plan in mind.</p>
 <p>These words caused the surrounding people to be speechless. Wang Delong’s face turned red in anger and looked at Nian Yuyang, “I need to kill this kid today, if you insist on interfering, then don’t blame me for being impolite!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, even on your deathbed, you are not aware of your own abilities.”</p>
 <p>After Nian Yuyang said that, there was a high pitch crane cry coming from the distance, a huge Ice Crane quickly flew towards them. Every time they blinking their eye, they could sense the shocking speed of the Ice Crane.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not expect to see Madam Duanmu. Although they were still a distance away, he could already see it was the huge Ice Crane.</p>
 <p>Looking at Nian Yuyang, Qing Shui knew why he was so confident, he had already invited Madam Duanmu over. Qing Shui was grateful to the old man for considering the situation, without even telling him the situation, he actually already knew what was happening.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui could not understand how Madam Duanmu rushed over so quickly from Duanmu City in Zhongyuan Country……</p>
 <p>“Madam Duanmu happened to be passing by the Jade Sea Country Capital City and was resting there, then I told her about your situation. With her around, you can relax.” Nian Lao revealed a smile that put Qing Shui at ease.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was relieved, when he raised his head again, Qing Shui could already see Madam Duanmu who was riding on the Ice Crane. Her skin was as smooth as jade and she had the same elegance as before, seeming very graceful. She looked very pretty, however, what was prettier was the aura that she was giving off, it had a fatal attraction.</p>
