However, during the time he was performing the Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant, there was an indescribable sense of mastery and proficiency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui didn't exert force, nor did he overuse the Origin Qi and spiritual energy in his body, he could sense that the power that he had struck out seemed to be very powerful. There was an amazing impactful force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like the feeling of the shield bash, giving the feeling that it could destroy everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft sound rang out but Qing Shui didn't stop and just continued on. His force was getting gradually stronger but it was being held onto and not released, contained within a radius of one foot around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If someone was around, they would be able to see the air movements around Qing Shui very clearly. It was like a vortex or a typhoon, seeming light yet also as if it had a fierce tearing force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of the Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant's amazing use - an impactful attack that neglected defense. Of course, neglecting the defense didn't mean that it was completely neglected, but only a small portion of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Although it wasn't very loud, it could be clearly heard, especially to Qing Shui. At the same time, another acupuncture point in his body seemed to have been cleared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, most of Qing Shui's acupuncture points and meridian channels had been cleared. However, he had always noticed that there were countless acupuncture points and meridian channels in the human body. As a person got stronger, more of these would appear. It wasn't as if they had increased in numbers, but just that previously, one hadn't reached the point where they would present themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's body continued to emit sounds ceaselessly in a quick-fire succession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>

It was because he felt that his body had gone through some small and strange changes. It was as if his entire body was now much more coordinated. He continued to hold onto the circle around him without releasing, but the force darted out a lot further than it had before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Small success stage!</span></p>

His Nine Yang Dragon Soul had yet to attain the small success stage yet his Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant had already reached it. Was this a good or a bad thing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing in the Dragon Form which said that he had to cultivate the Nine Yang Dragon Soul first, nor that without cultivating the Nine Yang Dragon Soul, one couldn't cultivate the Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant. Thinking of this made him feel a lot better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sunk deep into his consciousness and looked at the ability of the Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant which had reached the small success stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant: Small success stage. Can neglect 10% of all defense to deal a strong impact on the target. It can neglect all difference in abilities and can be merged into any fist arts or stances using weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at this, Qing Shui was extremely happy. After all, his current abilities required the use of the Golden Battle Halberd for them to be displayed. Without the Golden Battle Halberd, this move wouldn't have much effect. The stronger one was, the stronger their weapons would be. However, it was extremely hard for one to get their hands on Divine Weapons. Despite so, there were still Legendary and False God Weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He considered himself to had achieved a small success today. With the appearance of the Dragon Form—the final form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique—the Ancient Strengthening Technique had reached the final Heavenly Layer. At the very least, Qing Shui felt that this should be the last Heavenly Layer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then thought of the Portraits of Beauty. 11 out of 12 of them had already appeared. He didn't know if the last one would appear and if he would encounter her or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea if Qing Hanye was one of them. The Eldest Princess, Yehuang Guwu, and the others... He now believed that the 12 Portraits of Beauty should represent 12 types of Divine Bodies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He practiced for a while more before coming to a stop. Although it was only at the small success stage right now, what amazed Qing Shui was that he could already implement it into the Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique and perform it through the Golden Battle Halberd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the path of martial arts, clearing one path leads to many other paths being revealed. It could be because he had inherited the Dragon Form. No matter what, this was a good thing and was worth being happy about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he returned to the room, Yiye Jiange had already prepared breakfast. They had some simple food and had just finished when the Sunset Palace Mistress and Muyun Qingge walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, Jiange, we've got news. Do you want to know about it?" The Sunset Palace Mistress smiled and said as she headed to take a look at Qing Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both herself and Muyun Qingge were the child's godmothers. Back then, nothing was said about it, but they now felt a little awkward to have formed a connection with Qing Shui. After all, some things had happened and the others knew that the Sunset Palace Mistress liked Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What news?" Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Our people found an ancient desolate beast, the Hell Tigon, in a deep pool 100,000 li away from here." The Sunset Palace Mistress went straight to the point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hell Tigon?" Qing Shui was stunned as well. He knew about the existence of these ancient desolate beasts. There weren't many of them, but they were all extremely powerful. The Hell Tigon which the Sunset Palace Mistress mentioned was a real ancient desolate beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Real ancient desolate beasts were extremely powerful. The reason that made Qing Shui surprised was that it was by itself. It might have been an ancient desolate beast that appeared in this area. What he was looking forward to was its value.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an Essence Crimson Pellet in the bodies of ancient desolate beasts—the Desolate Beast Pellet. This thing can let cultivators get stronger tremendously and the increment was for the permanent strength. Although it might not be a lot, the important point was that the increment was stable. It also had the effect of stabilizing the foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the greatest effect. For most people, when having reached this level, their foundations would more or less restrict themselves from being able to get even stronger. The human body has a powerful self-adjustment ability and if one's foundation wasn't stable or was not stable enough, their strength would reach a bottleneck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The use of the Desolate Beast Pellet was primarily to build on the foundation. The increment to one's strength was limited and secondary. Most importantly, anyone would be able to eat it. There were demands but no supply for the Desolate Beast Pellet. No one would sell it since not just anyone could get their hands on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The way the Desolate Beast Pellet built onto one's foundation would in a way, increase one's strength. Stabilizing the foundation, calming the mind, increasing the willpower and spirit energy, reducing the chances of Qi Deviation, greatly increasing the body's power...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thing was very rare and it was also differentiated by quality. The more powerful the ancient desolate beasts, the greater the value of their Desolate Beast Pellets. Only desolate beasts with the Desolate Beast Pellet would be considered true desolate beasts. The Desolate Beast Pellet could be added into medicine to be refined into a powerful Constitution Nurturing Pill.</span></p>
