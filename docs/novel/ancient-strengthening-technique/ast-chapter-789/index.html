 <p><strong>AST 789 - Luan Luan's Great Strength, Alchemy Recipe for Beast Taming Pellet</strong></p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui, when will I be able to have my own ride?" Qing You asking Qing Shui with a bitter look on his face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that what he was referring to was a flying beast ride or those land-based powerful beast rides. However, he probably yearned for a flying ride more. After all, when making an escape or to be rushing on the way, a flying ride was the best choice.</p>
 <p>"That's right, Brother Qing Shui," Qing Bei also pouted and asked. After all, seeing how Luan Luan had so many demonic beasts and rides, they were both very jealous. It was hard not to be, especially when their talents were not comparable to the lass' either.</p>
 <p>"The ride must be tamed by yourself. It's said that there're Beast Taming Pellets in the world. Apparently, after taking it, it'll increase the chances for one to be able to tame the beast. It's a pity that I don't have the alchemy recipe." Qing Shui shrugged and smiled helplessly.</p>
 <p>"Haha, Brother Shui, if we can get you the alchemy recipe, does this mean that you'll refine the medicinal pill for us and will help us to tame the demonic beast as well?" Qing Bei grinned and asked.</p>
 <p>Stunned, Qing Shui nodded and smiled, saying, "Of course."</p>
 <p>"There, Brother Shui." Qing Bei took out a piece of Beast Parchment and passed it to Qing Shui, saying.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment before he received it. On one look, it was really the alchemy recipe for the Beast Taming Pellet. Moreover, it was one that was of a higher grade too, having increased the chances of taming the beast by two times more.</p>
 <p>The Beast Taming Pellets were segregated into third, sixth and ninth grade, each of which had only a small percentage of being able to successfully taming demonic beasts. Usually, if the person's cultivation level was higher than that of the demonic beast, the chances of defeating the demonic beast and taming it would be slightly higher. And when the Beast Taming Pellet was used, it could further increase the chances of success.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly looked at the alchemy recipe and the first ingredient was "Violent Spirit Grass"!</p>
 <p>The "Violent Spirit Grass" was a type of precious medicinal herb and could be taken directly. After taking it, it could increase the user's Berserk Aura by 30% for 15 minutes. During this time, the user's abilities would increase and his aura would also increase by a lot. The increase in aura, especially to the violent aura in the body, it could increase the chances of taming demonic beasts. However, after taking it, it was very damaging to the user's body.</p>
 <p>Looking at the rest of the medicinal herbs required, although they were also very precious, they were now nothing to Qing Shui and could be easily found.</p>
 <p>As for the "Violent Spirit Grass", he had gotten his hands on some on his recent trip to Southern Sea Country. It was because Qing Shui also knew that it was something precious but its uses were very limited. As of now, Qing Shui only knew that it could be used for refining the Beast Taming Pellet. There were not many people who would choose to take it directly since doing so would bring about great harm to one's body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had found these from the cart holding various medicinal herbs that had been sent to Ye Clan. Those had been kept by the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan and thus Ye Guyan made him keep it for his own use. Therefore, he didn't stand on ceremony and took some of them. Out of the medicinal herbs, there were some Violent Spirit Grass.</p>
 <p>"Brother Shui, how is it? Can you refine it?" Qing Bei looked at Qing Shui and asked, her eyes filled with anticipation.</p>
 <p>"I can. I'll bring you guys to tame demonic beasts in a while." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Oh, that's great!" Qing Bei cried out happily. Every cultivator yearned to have a powerful demonic beast of their own to be their partner in battles. They would also not have to fret and it would also be less troublesome for their travels. There were just too many benefits to having their own demonic beast...</p>
 <p>Squeak squeak...</p>
 <p>A clear squeal came from outside, one with an extremely strong penetrating impact. Stunned, Qing Shui broke into a happier smile, "Let's go, let's go take a look at Luan Luan's demonic beasts."</p>
 <p>Qing Bei and the others had long wanted to go but was afraid that they would disturb Luan Luan and her demonic beasts. Now, with Qing Shui saying that they could go, all of them naturally followed behind him. Luan Luan was in the Qing Clan's backyard, which had been set aside for cultivation. Other than a large arena, there was only a pavilion and a pond.</p>
 <p>The rest of the area was empty but there was a layer of grass that seemed to be specially grown. It was very densely grown and was similar to the lawn from Qing Shui's previous life. However, this was slightly taller.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan was standing a distance away, surrounded by ten silvery white Earth Devouring Mice. However, compared to the previous time, they had grown to become two times bigger than before. Now, each of them were two feet long, appearing to be very round with a metallic feel.</p>
 <p>Their limbs were very short and they were extremely agile. Qing Shui's hair also stood up when he looked at these Earth Devouring Mice. To be honest, Qing Shui also felt that it would be a bit hard for him to deal with these ten little creatures.</p>
 <p>Before he left, there was one Earth Devouring Mouse which was already Martial Saint level but now, it had become a Grade Five Martial Saint...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless. Luan Luan would need at least one month to become an elementary Martial Saint but now, she already had Martial Saint demonic beasts and there was more than one of them. Amongst the other nine, five of them were now Peak Grade Four Martial Saints while the remaining four were also Grade Four Martial Saints.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't the only one who was stunned, even Luan Luan was. Although she wasn't clear how strong the Earth Devouring Mice were, she knew that they were extremely powerful. With her Heart of Seven Orifices, her spiritual sense was very powerful and she could sense how terrifying these ten Earth Devouring Mice were.</p>
 <p>She recalled that Qing Shui had told her to give the medicinal pill to her most precious demonic beasts. It seemed that they were too precious. Seeing that there were still thirty of them, she took out one without hesitation and fed it to the towering Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear.</p>
 <p>This was the first powerful demonic beast which Qing Shui had given to her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the other members of Qing Clan stood a distance away. Di Chen, Yiye Jiange and Wenren Wu-shuang, who were also Martial Saints, were also astonished as they stood there, stunned on the spot.</p>
 <p>Earlier, they had felt that this lass' growth was unbelievably fast but with Qing Shui as the first example of fast paced growth, they could all accept this. However, this lass' ten plus demonic beasts, even just one of them was stronger than they were...</p>
 <p>Other than being surprised, they were also very happy. It was just that it was too sudden. Yiye Jiange looked at Luan Luan, her heart throbbing once again. Maybe he would really be able to bring her and Luan Luan to the Lion King's Ridge...</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange knew how powerful it was to have the Heart of Seven Orifices but also knew that the heaven was jealous of great talents. The deadly flaw for people with the Heart of Seven Orifices was their extremely short lifespans and that they would need to tame a large number of powerful demonic beasts. If there were any mistakes, the person could be put in a fatal situation.</p>
 <p>"Luan Luan has found herself a good father." Yiye Jiange broke into a gratified smile.</p>
 <p>After taking the pill, not long after, red colored flames started appearing on the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear's body, shining into the surroundings with a reddish glow. Its huge body was also gradually growing.</p>
 <p>Its height was already over fifteen meters but the growth gradually slowed down. So did the rate at which the body was swelling up. Now, the fiery red colored skin appeared to be tough like rocks.</p>
 <p>After a short moment, the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear quieted down. Luan Luan took out another pill and gave it to him.</p>
 <p>The flames which had just calmed down once again started to burn.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A huge beastly cry rang out. The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear abruptly shot up to twenty meters and appeared to be extremely powerful. It was covered in flames, with a great domineering aura.</p>
 <p>It nicely advanced to be a Grade Five Martial Saint!</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui and the others in the distance, Luan Luan let out a few cries before quickly running over to Qing Shui. Her beautiful face was covered with excitement and blushed from her agitation.</p>
 <p>"Daddy, this pill is so amazing!"</p>
 <p>"In the future, these ten Earth Devouring Mice and the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear will be your best partners. With them around, in the future, they'll be able to help you tame higher level demonic beasts. However, the prerequisite is that you'll also need to level up your cultivation level." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I know. I'll be able to become a Martial Saint in at most 50 days." Luan Luan smiled and said excitedly to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"My daughter is doing an excellent job." Qing Shui smiled and stroke Luan Luan's head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also felt that this was unbelievable. She was only three when he first met her but now, she had already grown up.</p>
 <p>The day passed by very quickly and it had already turned dark.Everyone had dinner together and it was a very lively and sumptuous meal. Looking at everything here, Qing Shui really felt very satisfied with what he had.</p>
 <p>The children went to sleep very early and thus Canghai Mingyue, Shi Qingzhuang and Mingyue Gelou returned after dinner. Qing Shui sent them back. There was no need for him to return to the hall.</p>
 <p>Di Chen and Di Qing also returned to their rooms. During all this time, they had felt very uneasy. After all, the matter with the Baima Aristocrat Clan was like a thorn to them.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang was also tired. In the end, when they left Shi Qingzhuang's room, there was only Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li left behind.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm heading back to rest as well. I'm so sleepy. I haven't had a good sleep for the past few days." Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui and said and then opened the door to her room. All of them stayed here this this great manor. It was very lively and all the rooms along the corridor were where they stayed.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li had yet to close the door when Qing Shui entered in a flash.</p>
 <p>"You rascal!" Huoyun Liu-Li mumbled, her face turning red.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grinned and closed the door before carrying the charming lady toward the bed.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li let out a soft cry and buried her face into Qing Shui's arms. Her beautiful body was feeling very hot and soon lit up the flames in Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Little demoness, your body is heating up." Qing Shui blew into Huoyun Liu-Li's ears and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"Wasn't this all because of you..."</p>
 <p>"What's because of me?" Qing Shui placed Huoyun Liu-Li on the bed before gradually pressing his body down on those towering peaks and teased.</p>
 <p>"I've missed you!" Huoyun Liu-Li's long eyes squinted and very quickly, were filled with a layer of mist. Slightly curved, they drew in Qing Shui's soul.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's hands moved around her body and their bodies met each other in all nakedness. Her pure white skin, her perfect curves and her peaks caused Qing Shui's blood vessels to expand very quickly. Very quickly, the two of them were overwhelmed by feelings and sounds of ecstasy.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, give me a child!"</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li hugged Qing Shui tightly, trembling furiously as she said.</p>
 <p>When it quieted down in the room, it was already late into the night. Huoyun Liu-Li entered a deep sleep with a satisfied smile on her face. Qing Shui planned to get up after lying down for a short while. A beauty's bed, a hero's tomb!</p>
