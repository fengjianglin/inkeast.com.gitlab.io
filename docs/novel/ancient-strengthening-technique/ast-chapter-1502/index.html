 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time everyone that was around was shocked, and for a time it became very quiet. People that were watching were ready to run at any time, after all, they are waiting for the fall of the Imperial Cuisine Hall to run out, while some have already begun to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“No wonder he can fight against the Se Clan, I really do not know whether you are ignorant or what you are relying on. You can either come with me and fight, or else I cannot guarantee that the Imperial Cuisine Hall will remain intact.' Lan Lingfeng said, unable to back down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this time Ziche Sha walked in and stood beside Qing Shui, and said while looking at Lan Lingfeng: Can you leave, I have already said many times that I don’t like you.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why, am I not good? Why can't you give me a chance? Tell me where I am lacking, and I will change it.” Lan Lingfeng in front of Ziche Sha went from loftiness to a little sheep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Emotional things cannot be forced, if they are even unwilling to be together, &nbsp;why force it if you are not happy." Ziche Sha shook her head and said indifferently</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have someone you like, who, can I see him so that I can die peacefully.” Lang Lingfeng said when staring at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do not like people who are controlling like you, I repeat, I do not like you. And if you still want to force it, we will not even be friends.” The tone of Ziche Sha was even able to refuse a man thousands of miles away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you like her?” Lang Lingfeng pointed to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now felt that if people who have run across a person they are fond of, becomes incredibly foolish. What is the meaning of asking such naive questions? Can you answer this Ziche Sha?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Sha looked up to Lan Lingfeng's cold eyes without any sense of affection, and then slowly turned her head, even his questions were not answered, as she waked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment Lan Lingfeng’s heart felt as if it had hit rock bottom. He suddenly looked at Qing Shui: “You are the one who has taken her away from me, I will kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also indistinct, did the heart of the first son of Linhai City have the ability to bear such a difference? Or was it most important for him to do this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui feels that the latter may be relatively larger, as Lan Lingfeng is at a critical point this time, and although he is not crazy, but he didn’t seem to be clear headed at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, many people in Linhai City knew that Lan Lingfeng liked Ziche Sha, and he has always thought that he was the only who deserved her. Lan Lingfeng was indeed excellent, but this first son of Linhai City was not invincible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the rushing Lan Lingfeng and found that the opponent's attack was not messy at the slightest. It was a thought-out move, knowing that the first son of Linhai just took this opportunity to do this and nothing more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems that the first son of Linhai City had his little plans, as everyone saw him go crazy and just wanted to kill Qing Shui, because he was the one who made Lingfeng crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was defeated by Qing Shui, that is, he lost his mind and his strength was reduced by Qing Shui, so, if the Qing Shui killed a crazy person, then his good name in the medical field would be affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Lan Lingfeng was taking advantage of this well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s figure dodged but didn’t retaliate. The Nine Palace Steps was formidable. Not to mention, the two haven’t used their full strength yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First son Lan, don’t you feel like you are like a woman, a crazy-insane woman?.” Qing Shui did not fight back, and just verbally irritated him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng did not utter a reply, but the power of his attacks was getting higher and higher. If Qing Shui enveloped the surrounding area within the Nine Palace, and as the Nine Palace is not broken, nothing will happen to the building</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is also the reason why Qing Shui dared to fight here, Qing Shui did not want anything unexpected to happen to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, lest someone messes with it and causes it to fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng felt like he was trapped in a cage, as his consumption suddenly increased by several times, the body seems to have been put under repeated pressure. Looking at the calmness on Qing Shui’s face, he knew that this young man had astonishing skills, and that calmness was not pretend. He also came to know that he had met an opponent today, so the blood in his body was boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui slowly used his body to move Lan Lingfeng to the door and then directly played a trick to force him out. He also followed him out and then went straight to the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng was actually struggling with Qing Shui, so they quietly went out into the open air. Their battle has already made him satisfied, so there was no need to destroy the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are very strong!” Lan Lingfeng said seriously to Qing Shui while looking at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don't know why you want to fight me. If you lose, you won't know how you were beat, do you want to die?” Qing Shui looked at Lan Lingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You underestimate me, Lan Lingfeng, if I couldn’t take a hit, how would I have lasted until today."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head: “If you are ready, I am going to strike.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took out the Golden Battle Halberd!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Lan Lingfeng's eyes, he weirdly and oddly said: “Are you one of the successors of the Golden Battle God or have you received an inheritance from the Golden Battle God?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a bit surprised for a moment, while Lan Lingfeng did not feel the familiar feeling, and asked with a frown: “Is this important?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That’s because I received the legacy of the Silver Wolf Wargod.” Lan Lingfeng smiled and looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No wonder I could feel the breath of the Wargod on you, can we not fight?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why fight, the Golden Battlegod is the leader of the Wargods.” Lan Lingfeng said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Glorious Wargod...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, I know, I know of the Wargod household. I won't fight for Ziche Sha.” Lan Lingfeng said, a little discouraged.</span></p>

Since the fight is over, and people are in love with each other, and now they have to follow this relationship. Therefore, this decision was finalized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who told you I had a relationship with her?" Qing Shui said at his ridiculous reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't you like Ziche Sha? I think she seems to like you very much.” Lan Lingfeng said bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is our second meeting, and at least, I have nothing to do with her for now, and at present, I don’t want anything to do with her. If you truly like her, don’t go with what you just did, women will feel that you are narrow-minded.” Qing Shui shook his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng looked at Qing Shui for a long time before he came to know that Qing Shui was not joking. His face was filled with surprise. He could not understand why Qing Shui did not like Ziche Sha. No one, according to him, did not like her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank you, I will try my best." Lan Lingfeng spoke with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don't have to thank me. If I liked a woman, I would not let her go. In addition, women and love cannot be forced. What you have to do is make the other person like you. Forget it. You will understand.” Qing Shui shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Well, I know, this is mainly because I care about her, we are still brothers. Can I live in a room here? I can pay rent.” Lan Lingfeng laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We don't have to be brothers any more, we can just call each other by name." Said Qing Shui with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, we will do as you wish, just him brother or whatever you want. About the room...” Lan Lingfeng seemed to be more concerned with this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do as you wish, you can find a room for yourself.” Qing Shui shook his head and went down together with Lan Lingfeng, talking and laughing, and the many people watching them were very puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was most depressing was the Hua Clan that was enjoying the scene from the distance, the Imperial Cuisine Hall and Lan Clan were irreconcilable adversaries, but they did not think it would end like this, they were unexpectedly talking to each other joyfully, all of a sudden, they were like intimate brothers, 这是为别人做嫁衣吗…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew what happened, even Ziche Sha also didn’t know, surprised to see the two, only Yin Tong seemed to kind of understand what happened, but was not sure, he was the Fox Wargod. The fox and wolf wargods’ relationships were very good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several people left the hall to go to the backyard, but no one spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“isn’t Sha’er very strange?” Lan Lingfeng said with a smile</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Sha was clearly not happy as she glanced at the two, she felt Lan Lingfeng seems to have changed, but also did not know where he changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng actually changed, this was the impact of Qing Shui on him, and a few words from Qing Shui made him suddenly awake. He has also suddenly seen a lot of things, and has also undergone subtle changes mentality, this was an awakening, like a spiritual upgrade</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng’s heart was very grateful to Qing Shui, he suddenly felt that his self-confidence was higher in front of Ziche Sha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He truly was arrogant, he got over the so-called crazy authorities. Feeling as if things were not as difficult as before, such as chasing Ziche Sha, which now seems to not be so difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“'In fact, Qing Shui was my brother who had been lost for many years, which I had just learned...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of Qing Shui’s mouth were drawn up, but he did not say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Keep on talking nonsense." Ziche Sha looked at Lan Lingfeng and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh, didn’t you say that you knew the Wargods?" Lan Lingfeng said softly</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The ancient Wargods, I have heard of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui and I are the people who have the Wargods’ inheritance. Oh, there is also this old brother.” Lan Lingfeng said with a smile, and finally there was a chance to tell Ziche Sha about his identity, so how can it be said that he added some color to himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Sha first took a look at Lan Lingfeng then took a look at Qing Shui and Yintong. She knew that what he said was true. Now she knows why Lan Lingfeng was able to become the first son of Linhai City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lang Lingfeng's conditions now were very good. No one is perfect, women are awfully strange. A man chasing her and holding her tight as he puts her into the position of a goddess. It can be safe to say that the two cannot be together, a woman is looking for a man, not someone to raise her up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the beginning men have never them as equals, so naturally, love was never equal. Only when a man is able to lower himself will he become aware of his partner’s feelings and not just his own. It is like giving to the poor. Love is established on equal footing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw that Lan Lingfeng and Ziche Sha was really a good match, but was it possible to watch to see if the two were destined? As for Qing Shui, he had a mission to find Yiye Jiange, and also to find the Tantai Lingyan that iceberg goddess…..</span></p>
