 <p><strong>AST 1366 - Showdown against False God Warriors, That’s all they have got? The fall of False God Warriors</strong></p>
 <p>This was an aged old man with a perfectly straight body. He had the nose of an eagle and eyes of a sparrow. Despite his old age, he still gave off a fierce and ruthless aura, giving people the impression that he was a person who wouldn’t hesitate to kill.</p>
 <p>A lot of people, including the people from Yehuang Clan, all expressed shock upon hearing such words. Once she returned to Yehuang Clan, Yehuang Clan would have been hers. Despite all that was said, Yehuang Clan was still the main ruler of Yehuang Country. For a woman from a particular clan, she could own the entire Yehuang Clan once she came back?</p>
 <p>There was no precedent for such a situation. At the very least, there were very few women who could actually take over a clan. This was particularly so for clans like Yehuang Clan which had reached great heights. If a woman was to take over the clan, it would only have meant that there were no powerful men in their clan.</p>
 <p>This would embarrass all the men in Yehuang Clan. They wouldn’t be able to raise their head in front of people.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu didn’t have a desire to rule Yehuang Clan. In the past, it was impossible to make her do it. As for now, she no longer kept Yehuang Clan in her eyes. The reason being that she knew clearly that the man by her side could very easily crush this clan in the future.</p>
 <p>Even for herself, it wouldn’t take long until she could crush them. But also, she was here today to seek vengeance.</p>
 <p>“The battle history for each family was always about them getting from weak to strong and then reverting back to becoming weak once again. The foundations the seniors of the clan built, contributed to the arrogant attitude which was built up within the later generations of the clan, so much that they may even lose their own very basic humanity. It is true that we live in a world where only the strong survive, hence, since they have done it, they will have to be prepared to revert back into weaklings,” Yehuang Guwu looked at the old man and said gently.</p>
 <p>She had made her words very clear. Her purpose in coming today was to eliminate Yehuang Clan.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Duxin’s heart was bleeding. If he hadn’t done those things back then, if she had still been a member of Yehuang Clan, who would be able to stop Yehuang Clan in Yehuang Country?</p>
 <p>But little did he know, it was precisely because of how he treated Yehuang Guwu that Qing Shui got to meet her and got his Five Elements Divine Flag. It was because of this that he was able to come to Dancing Phoenix Continent. The reason why Yehuang Guwu was able to achieve this kind of level was also because she met Qing Shui. If Yehuang Guwu didn’t have a background like this, there would have been a little bit of change to Qing Shui’s life.</p>
 <p>“What condition do you need in order for you to return to Yehuang Clan. As long as it’s something I am capable of, I will promise you.” All along, the old man’s expression remained the same.</p>
 <p>“I won’t go back to Yehuang Clan, nor have I ever thought about it. I will do the things which I want to do myself. Everyone has to be responsible for the things which they have done.” Yehuang Guwu looked at the nervous person opposite her.</p>
 <p>“Every aristocratic clan is bound to have some sort of corruption within them. This applies to all clans.” The old man was insisting on trying to persuade Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui has never expected his opponent’s attitude to be like this. Initially, he thought that they would act right away. Hence, Qing Shui didn’t really do or say anything standing at the side. As long as they didn’t try to attack Yehuang Guwu all at once, he wouldn’t rush to act himself.</p>
 <p>“I want him to vanish. If you don’t plan to take part in it, please stand aside. I will treat whoever tries to stop me as enemies,” Yehuang Guwu spoke firmly.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, we only think that you seem to be quite promising. Don’t go starting to think so highly of yourself. Do you really think that the entire Yehuang Clan will be eliminated by the hands of you alone? What a joke,” an old man standing at the side said a bit angrily.</p>
 <p>Among these people, they had never interfered with the affairs going on in the clan. But if anything was to happen, no one would dare to violate their wishes. Since when had they acted so politely before? Even with that being the case, the opponents still acted stubbornly.</p>
 <p>It was good if things turned out this way too. This way, from outsider’s perspective, it would seem like Yehuang Clan had done all that they could. It was Yehuang Guwu who was going too far. If they were to take action over it and Qing Shui was to interfere, they wouldn’t mind eliminating him.</p>
 <p>“Move!”</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu simply got straight to her point. She no longer wanted to waste time talking with these people. The vengeance she had in her heart could only be solved with fresh blood.</p>
 <p>“You impudent brat! Alright then, show me what kind of capabilities you have to act so arrogantly today.” The old man who was speaking from before took out a sword in his hand and immediately swung it towards Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>The leading old man didn’t say anything to try to stop it. His expression made people wonder what he was thinking.</p>
 <p>Kong!</p>
 <p>Kong!</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu quickly summoned another white tiger. The two white tigers immediately approached the old man who was charging his way here. They were just like two rays of white light, carrying along a sharp and intense murderous aura.</p>
 <p>Back then, when she condensed her first white tiger, a few of the old men were already shocked by it. But now....</p>
 <p>“Let me help you deal with one of them.”</p>
 <p>Among the few old men, one of them quickly charged forward and blocked one of the white tigers.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu knitted her brows and moved both of her hands. As she did so, another two completely identical white tigers once again appeared. They charged towards the opponents with even faster speed.</p>
 <p>Now, other than Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu, everyone was stunned. Each and every one of the tigers had the strength of a False God. And there were four of them. This was such terrifying strength.</p>
 <p>White Tiger Four Forms Kill!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the four white tigers started attacking from weird directions. They instantaneously surrounded the two old men. After that, the only thing seen was four rays of white bright light being shot out.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Before the two old men in the centre managed to react to it on time. A pitch black colored hole immediately appeared on the spot where the attack landed. It gave off weird light.</p>
 <p>The two old men disappeared.</p>
 <p>White Tiger Devour!</p>
 <p>This technique was very powerful. One would need skills in order to use it. Adding on the fact that the two old men were slightly weaker than the white tiger and also that the white tigers stood advantageous in terms of numbers, the two old men immediately got murdered.</p>
 <p>Those were Grade One False God warriors…...</p>
 <p>Even for Qing Shui, it was the first time he witnessed the defeat of a False God. The people below all looked pale as a result of the huge shock which they had just received. Some of the people had even left quietly. One false move might cost them their very own lives.</p>
 <p>“Move, kill them!”</p>
 <p>This time, the leading old man stopped hesitating and dropped the order. After that, he immediately charged towards Yehuang Guwu. Two of the old men died, seven still remained. Simultaneously, the old man also let out a sharp scream. He seemed to be calling out for more people.</p>
 <p>Could it be that there were still False God warriors in Yehuang Clan?</p>
 <p>At this moment, QIng Shui moved.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>The tyrannical Emperor’s Qi right away shredded off 20% of the opponent’s strength, including everything which they did from before.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Law!</p>
 <p>Gravity Law, Devouring Law!</p>
 <p>This was a law of proportion. Regardless of whether the opponents were strong or weak, they were all measured according to the scales.</p>
 <p>20%, stacking on with the Nine Palace Laws, together, they caused two of the old men’s strength to drop below that of False God Realm.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu unleashed her footwork. As she swung her hand, yet another two white tigers appeared beside her. They were there to keep her safe. After all, her opponents were Grade One False God Warriors.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the people from Yehuang Clan really felt like spitting out blood. Anyone with a brain would know the importance of False God warriors to a clan. In the blink of an eye, they already lost two of them. If a clan didn’t have False God warriors, it was safe to assume that they would be eliminated very quickly.</p>
 <p>The emergence of every clan would influence a lot of people. They all climbed up by stepping on other people. Once they became no good in strength, they would just get stepped on by others, instead. This was precisely the World of the Nine Continents in which only the strong would survive and the weak would become prey for the strong ones.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Nine Continents Mountain. Having been weakened, Qing Shui’s Nine Continents Mountain could push back the opponents. Having the ability to do this, Qing Shui smiled. Do not underestimate the False God warriors on the opposite side. If not for the white tigers Yehuang Guwu had, the only thing left which Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu could do would be to run away. If there was only one of them however, Qing Shui felt that it was no problem for him to deal with him.</p>
 <p>“That old man in blue cloth, let me create an opportunity for you. Let the white tigers surround and kill him,” said Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>In any case, the Nine Continents Mountain was just like a tiny mountain top. Qing Shui controlled it as he thrust it towards one of the old men. The old man quickly dodged seeing that the Nine Continents Mountain was approaching him. Before this, he had already felt something weird about this tiny mountain top.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui saw the old man dodge, he immediately summoned the Seal of Roc towards the other old man.</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, the Nine Continents Mountain immediately clashed against the other two elderly men.</p>
 <p>The attacks caused by the Nine Continents Mountain weren’t really fatal. The main thing in play was the terrifying strength of the Shield Attack. One would have felt really uncomfortable upon colliding against it once.</p>
 <p>They avoided it. This was precisely what Qing Shui wanted. He immediately blocked them with Nine Continents Mountain. The Nine Continents Mountain was about a hundred meters in size.</p>
 <p>When a Grade One False God warrior was to face off against four white tigers with strength worth 1.6 million sun, the outcome was already predictable.</p>
 <p>White Tiger Slaughter!</p>
 <p>Under this kind of strangling, a Grade One False God warrior could only suffer the fate of being annihilated. Grade One False God warriors, they hadn’t even learned his Heavenly Vision Technique. They wouldn’t be able to even escape from it. The powerful auras from the four white tigers were constantly keeping the surroundings confined.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Dragon Whip!</p>
 <p>Spiritual Snake Exits Cave!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was moving in between them using the Snake Elephant’s Movement which he was still quite new to. He was unleashing attacks quite frequently. From time to time, attacks with a doubled prowess would be unleashed. But it was only able to only help make the situation a bit more difficult for the opponents.</p>
 <p>Actually, in a way, Qing Shui was also considered to be practicing his Snake Elephant’s Movement. Of course, he still had most of his attention on Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>Though she may have summoned the white tigers, one moment of distraction could lead her to be instantly killed by her opponents. This was something which would never be allowed to happen. Luckily, she had another two white tigers by her side. Or else, Qing Shui would definitely be put in an incomparably difficult situation. The most efficient and quickest way to deal with his opponents was the Nine Continents Mountain. And also, the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui did this was in order to train Yehuang Guwu’s capability in actual combat. Hence, for now, the fight was going on very steadily. With the existing Nine Palace Laws, having been weakened by Qing Shui, the white tigers had now gained the upper hand.</p>
 <p>So what if they were False God warriors? As of now, Qing Shui was feeling really emotional. Despite Yehuang Guwu not being a False God warrior, she was able to summon out six False God grade “demonic beasts”. Or rather, they were known to be at Immortal Demon grade.</p>
 <p>Though Qing Shui’s own strength might not be that high and that he might only be able to achieve the offensive strength of a False God when the chance to double in prowess was met when he used the Seals of Roc, he still had the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. It had proven to be no problem for him to bind these people to death.</p>
 <p>Time went on little by little. This was the most outrageous and exceptional fight which Qing Shui has ever experienced in his entire life. He felt just like the warrior who was walking along the tip of the sharp blades. It may be dangerous, yet it also brought along a lot of thrills.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu on the other hand, was doing things in accordance with the belief she had in her mind. She was controlling the white tigers to fight with her consciousness. Unknowingly, her coordination as well as the control she had over the white tiger was improving at a very fast pace. It had gotten to the point that she could stand on top of one of the white tigers’ backs. Being this way would help further make sure that she was in a safe position.</p>
 <p>As for Qing Shui, he who already possessed the Nine Palace Step, combining it with the Nine Palace Laws and also the Sacred Jade Divine Stone and Nine Continents Step, if Qing Shui wanted to retreat safely, no one would be able to stop him. He was the Lord of Nine Palace. It was very easy for him to shuttle back and forth within the Nine Palace. From time to time, he would unleash his attacks and hurt his opponents by making use of whichever elements were advantageous against them. His state of mind to do things as he pleased was improving at a fast pace.</p>
 <p>The most important thing to have was the mentality. Since the beginning, the opponents they were facing off against were False God Warriors, after all. Even Qing Shui would feel really pressured against them. But now, he felt that he had gotten more relaxed than before. This was a kind of breakthrough in one’s state of mind. It was, in a way, considered taking control of your own mind and following your heart’s desire.</p>
 <p>His Heavenly Dao Spiritual Sense had improved.</p>
