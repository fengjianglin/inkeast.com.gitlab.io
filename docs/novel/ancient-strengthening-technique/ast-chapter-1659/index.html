 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning which struck at the beginning was bearable. The purpose of the lightning was to refine her physical body. Hence, she mustn’t resist them. She would be fine as long as she withstood them. It was beneficial for her body because the lightning wouldn’t cause any damage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning which continued to strike later on were still helpful to her body, but ordinary people wouldn’t be able to withstand their fearsome power. Hence, they would get hurt by them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After withstanding a few strikes of the lightning, Yiye Jiange’s body had recovered a lot. This made Qing Shui feel more relieved. No matter what happened, she must hold on. Qing Shui would never allow any accidents to happen to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t feel nervous. Jiange will be fine.” Muyun Qingge was able to tell that Qing Shui was feeling nervous. At the same time, she also couldn’t understand what exact emotion he was feeling. He didn’t feel as nervous when Muyun Qingge herself was going through her False God Divine Tribulation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, Muyun Qingge was stunned. She was shocked by her own thought. She shook her head and for a moment, feeling confused. She didn’t even notice what Qing Shui was saying later on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time went on little by little. The lightning which struck from the sky were also getting thicker and thicker. They were almost snow white in color. As they struck the ground, they immediately went into Yiye Jiange’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, only some of them were absorbed into her body. The lightning didn’t actually cause Yiye Jiange’s body to stiffen. She was constantly avoiding the lightning inside the lightning regions as she absorbed the energies from the tiny lightning, accumulating them little by little to refine her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since it was not her first time going through a False God Divine Tribulation, she was already quite experienced with it. She was also born with an outstanding innate talent. Meanwhile, the Immortal-defying Force within her body wasn’t just sitting by doing nothing neither. It formed a faint halo the size of a fist within Yiye Jiange’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were more and more lightning in the air and the ones falling were getting stronger and stronger. The smaller lightning was appearing less and less. Fortunately, Yiye Jiange’s body had changed a lot during this period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful lightning strikes caused Yiye Jiange to toter in the air. Qing Shui constantly kept an eye on her from the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Yiye Jiange felt very exhausted. She was almost at her limit. But then, in her mind, Qing Shui’s face appeared. She suddenly remembered what Qing Shui had said to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She remembered that she was already married to Qing Shui. They even agreed on giving birth to a baby. The boy would definitely look like him. The girl, on the other hand, should share less resemblance with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, it felt as if her body had once again regained strength. If she successfully passed through this trial, she would end up a Divine Warrior. By then, he would no longer have to worry about her. She would also be of help to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body began to stiffen up. As that happened, she found herself heavily struck by an enormous lightning. As that happened, even her very consciousness was shaken by the strike. That was the fearsomeness of False God Divine Tribulations. There was a huge chance that her own existence could be eliminated entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, she managed to evade the next lightning. She managed to receive a buffer in her body. There was a saying that went ‘An old man lost his mare, but it all turned out for the best’. This was the benefit of being refined with lightning. So long as a person didn’t get struck to the point they were erased from existence, the person would receive huge benefits from it. Despite this, there were still people who wouldn’t want to take such a risk. After all, it was still a dangerous bet. One careless mistake could cause a person to end up an idiot, so much that they might even be erased from existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, Qing Shui was also very nervous. Yiye Jiange’s body was in a very weak state. Though the enormous lightning might not totally annihilate her, he feared that it would strike her the moment when she was in her most frail state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, yet another two lightning struck. Qing Shui took a few steps forward without himself even noticing it. He was almost about to run to her, particularly the final time the lightning struck. But then he was stopped by Muyun Qingge, “If you do that, not only will it not do good to yourself, it will also harm Jiange and potentially lead her to her death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui calmed himself down. Yiye Jiange still had the Gold Needles which Qing Shui injected her with. These Gold Needles could help protect her heart and blood veins. It had also managed to help her awaken her potential. For instance, it could help her regain her consciousness at the moment when she was on the brink of fainting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the following lightning struck, looking obviously smaller than the last one, Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the aura being emitted from Yiye Jiange’s body was constantly rising. The amount of lightning that struck was starting to decrease. It only took a while until all of them disappeared. Until now, the aura around her body was still constantly rising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Yiye Jiange even sensed her current body, she immediately appeared in front of Qing Shui, “I succeeded!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge left without the two of them noticing. Qing Shui only let go of Yiye Jiange after hugging each other for a while, “How are you feeling?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great. I feel that I am significantly more powerful than before. Indeed, the path of martial arts has no limits.” Yiye Jiange said in a grateful tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could sense Yiye Jiange’s strength. It was just slightly more powerful than Muyun Qingge’s. Her strength was already past 1000 Dao Force. It was approximately around 1200 Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her strength could definitely be described as fearsome. Though there was still a huge gap between hers and Qing Shui’s strength, her strength could still be considered to have skyrocketed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Divine Grade Warrior had finally emerged among Qing Shui’s women. Even Qing Shui himself found it a bit hard to believe so. Him breaking through to Divine Grade was already a surprise to himself. It all happened by accident. As for the two girls, they didn’t just do it out of carelessness. Despite this, for a moment, Qing Shui still found it really hard to believe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange’s Divinity Spirit consisted of Immortal-defying Force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Qing Shui’s surprise, the ability of Immortal-defying Force was exactly the same as the Jade Kirin Dragon Vessel Tyrannical Aura. This had caused Qing Shui to be in great shock. He didn’t know which one he should call powerful, whether it was the Immortal-defying Force or the Jade Kirin Dragon Vessels that was the most powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, it could also be upgraded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must remember what you said!” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange was stunned. For a moment, she was really embarrassed, being reminded of the things she said about her being his knight. The situation from before was special. Once a person went through a calamity and survived, some changes would occur in the mind. Even Yiye Jiange was no exception. She looked at Qing Shui with a shy expression, “Of course I remember what I said.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a while, two Divine Grade Warriors emerged in the Sea King Palace. This was a very significant change. Within these two days, three powerful Aqua races had already made their way here to request for aid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aquatics possessed very powerful sense organs. They were aware that there were a lot of Divine existences here. However, normally, they wouldn’t head here as they would have died a meaningless death if they were killed by warriors at the Divine Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Aqua races were of the Violet Golden Battle King Crab. They were three brothers with decent strength. But now, there was a significant gap between their strength compared to Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a good thing to have people requesting for aid, particularly in this kind of situation. With sufficient strength, one would have everything under control. If it was in the past, even if these three expert warriors had come to request for help, it was unlikely that they would have offered them help in return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, things were different. If it had been in the past, even if the difference in strength wasn’t significant, they must act formally to these people who requested for help as it didn’t seem like the other party would be willing to acknowledge allegiance to them. But now, even if they were to act a bit less politely, they would still act knowing their places and acknowledge it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was strength. To warriors, it was shown in the form of respect which came from deep within their heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They gave the three brothers a Water Entrance and considered them to be one of the Sea King Palace’s branches. It was just like the twelve underground branches which the Demon Lord Palace had, only that a Water Entrance was slightly bigger in size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, the Sea King Palace also only had very few Water Entrances left. The Carp Tribe, the Black Scaled Mermen and so on. Now, the Ancient Violet Golden Battle King Crab had been added into their arsenal. It was considered as one of the strongest branches of the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had met the three brothers before. They were intelligent people. Deep down, they knew that the Sea King Palace’s fate to rise up in strength was confirmed. Considering that they were the first party to request for help now, they would most probably turn out to be dozens in the future. In other words, the benefits which they could receive from this would be very significant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when Qing Shui met them, he only explained to them about his relationship with the Sea King Palace. He also gave them a few benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three brothers were aware of Qing Shui’s existence. Prior to this, he managed to eliminate the Golden Sand Palace with ease. Now, basically, everyone had been made aware of the strength of the Ice Ocean Domain. Furthermore, when they were in close interaction with Qing Shui, they could feel themselves being suppressed by him to the point where they couldn’t breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things would be fine as long as the goal was achieved. Qing Shui felt that it was time to pay Sunset Palace a visit. Basically, the Sea King Palace was at a stage where they were making swift progress. Qing Shui had a feeling that very soon, the Sea King Palace would develop into the Northern Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace was the same as usual. The Dragon King Palace didn’t make an appearance. This caused Qing Shui to began to wonder if they would not come since it had already been almost a week.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would pay the place a visit every day. The Sunset Mistress was also aware of it and deep down, she felt very happy. Qing Shui was a responsible man. If the Dragon King Palace had made their way here, he would definitely stand in front to protect her. At least, this was how she felt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, Qing Shui would scan the place from far away. If he knew that everything was going on normally around here, he would leave. It was just that this time, he happened to run into the Sunset Palace Mistress. She smiled as she approached Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman had a lovely and beautiful look. The Mermaid Tribe wasn’t in the slightest inferior to the Drakaina. They were both the noblest bloodlines across the ocean. They were also quite rare in terms of numbers. It was also quite difficult for them to be discovered, otherwise, they would have been the targets of a lot of forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You came!” Sunset Palace Mistress said happily when she saw Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I am here.” Qing Shui’s heart was moved at the moment when he saw the Sunset Palace Mistress. It was not the kind of sexual emotion. It was the thought of getting the Sunset Palace to form an alliance with the Sea King Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress was, at a time, even more powerful than Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge. She was only half a step away from becoming a Divine Warrior. It could be said that one of her feet had already passed the gate towards the Divine Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a mermaid just like Muyun Qingge and because she had a powerful bloodline, Qing Shui could help her break through to the Divine Grade with ease. Even if Qing Shui didn’t help her, she would have managed to step in on her own in ten years or less than a hundred years time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Sunset Palace and the Sea King Palace were to help each other and form an alliance, it would only provide them benefits in both the Northern Sea and the Ice Ocean Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Congratulations for your wife’s breakthrough to a Divine Grade Warrior.” Sunset Palace Mistress said with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that she was aware of it. It wasn’t difficult for her to learn about such a huge issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you. If the Sunset Palace is to form an alliance with the Sea King Palace, both of our strengths will definitely increase significantly. By then, no one would dare bully us ever again.” Qing Shui smiled and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They won’t fancy me with the level of strength I am at the moment. I know my own limit. Not to mention that Sunset Palace is currently in a troublesome situation. I think I will pass on that. I won’t feel natural with such an alliance going on anyway.” Sunset Palace Mistress shook her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can help shorten the time needed for you to achieve Divine Grade. Are you willing to give it a go?” Qing Shui made up his mind to make his move. This way, he would have, in total, three Divine Grade Warriors. It would be extremely difficult to take them down. Even the Divine Moon Immortal Sect would be as powerful as the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really? Are you willing to help me?” Instead of asking if he could help her, Sunset Palace Mistress was asking if he was willing to help her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t mind, I can help you. By then, I will introduce you to them and we will form an alliance together. What’s your opinion on this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, I am willing to do it. I am just not sure about the others.”</span></p>
