 <p><strong>AST 1262 - Eight Swift Agile Pill. The Fire Bird Which Consumed The Nirvanic Fruit, Rapid Advancement</strong></p>
 <p>Actually, the girl had a lot of faith in Qing Shui. She smiled and nodded: “I believe in you. My name is Fu Rong. Well then, we will meet here again tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, see you tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t stay in the shop any longer and also took his leave after he finished speaking. In any case, he had already looked through almost all of the stuffs here. Actually, he didn’t really considered that he would be able to buy an outstanding item for a fairly cheap price as very few people actually knew about the Blackmoon Star. Without the Heavenly Vision Technique, it would have been impossible for him to know that it was the Blackmoon Star. However, he also felt really upset. He managed to find the Blackmoon Star precisely because it was sold for a high price. A lot of people on the other hand, would think that it was not worth the price at all.</p>
 <p>The only thing which Qing Shui didn’t understand was why the boss here would sell the Blackmoon Star for such a high price.</p>
 <p>After a while, Qing Shui also stopped to think about it. Actually, the answer was really simple, he happened to wander into this shop. For example, there might still be similar things in this shop but they had all been taken away by the early birds while he himself wasn’t aware of it. Hence, there really wasn’t a question of whether it was worth it. It was only a matter of whether it would suit his need and whether it was something which he looked up to.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked into the Imperial City Inn.</p>
 <p>The Royal Clan of the Divine Might Dynasty was none other than the Fu Clan. It was an indisputable fact that the little girl from before, Fu Rong, was someone from the Royal Clan. Furthermore, she might very likely possess quite a high position as well.</p>
 <p>In any case, the Imperial City Inn still held the name of the Royal Clan. Hence, not only did it occupy a lot of space, it was also very high-class. As for the environment, there was nothing to complain about. No matter how daring a person was, he or she wouldn’t dare to seek trouble in the Imperial City Inn. Even people who tried to hide away from people trying to kill them would end up really safe in the Imperial City Inn.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui booked a random room in front of the counter. He didn’t fear even the Royal Clan in the Divine Might Dynasty. If he was to really fight someone now and it just so happened to also be a one-on-one fight, it would be impossible for even the highest existence in the Western Oxhe Continent to beat him.</p>
 <p>Even though it was still early, Qing Shui still entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Now, he didn’t really have a fixed time to enter the realm. Normally, he would go in there at the last part of the day and went to sleep as soon as he came out. He might also go in there at the earliest part of a day. As for now, he entered at the last part of a day.</p>
 <p>After going in, Qing Shui first started by refining some medicines. He now felt that refining medicines wasn’t a problem to him. However, he also didn’t know how long he would need to refine the Swift Agile Pill. If the time needed was long, he would just refine the Blackmoon Star tomorrow. This was the main thing he had in mind.</p>
 <p>The medicine refining process was still fairly quick. Even though Qing Shui didn’t dare to call himself number one in terms of refining medicines, he felt deep down that he wouldn’t lose to anyone. One day, he felt that he might be able to turn out to be one of the greatest alchemists.</p>
 <p>Cleansing, refining, picking medicines…… He did all of these regularly and thoroughly. Qing Shui was really calm. Ever since he took a huge leap in strength, it seemed as if he had everything within his grasp. This was a very powerful self-confidence.</p>
 <p>A man with self-confidence was the most attractive man. Of course, this kind of self-confidence wasn’t an act of arrogance. Self-confidence wasn’t expressed through one’s expression, nor was it expressed through words. On the contrary, it was something proved to people through actions.</p>
 <p>The entire refining process took 49 days. He didn’t know how long other alchemists needed. In any case, Qing Shui felt that the time he needed to refine medicines had reached a limit.</p>
 <p>Forty Nine days!</p>
 <p>It seemed like medicinal pills which would require 49 days were all mostly pretty good medicinal pills. This made Qing Shui felt that it was a bit time-consuming. He wondered if the time to refine medicines in the future would be cut shorter. For example, within two or three days time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately laid down to take a break after he finished refining medicines. Even with his valiant strength, 49 days of constantly consuming his energy had also put a huge burden on him. Hence, once it succeeded, he immediately laid down to rest. This kind of deep sleep was the best way to recover.</p>
 <p>After eight hours, Qing Shui woke up on time. He opened the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron with excitement and got shocked when he saw eight light-green colored medicinal pills at the bottom of the cauldron. They were almost at the size of a thumb.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the effect and realized that it was the same as the little girl said.</p>
 <p>QIng Shui immediately contained them into eight porcelain bottles. He really wanted to take a few of them away, but he was a person with principle. Principle should never be broken. Just like in some situations, one shouldn’t steal nor snatch away things which belong to someone else.</p>
 <p>After he put them away nicely, Qing Shui began to cultivate. Right at this moment, he suddenly came to realize that the Fire Bird was slowly absorbing the fiery aura around the Nirvanic Fruit. He didn’t know since when the Nirvanic Fruit had begun shooting out fiery aura into the surroundings like it was spreading smoke.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know if it was the fiery aura emitted by the Nirvanic Fruit itself or by the Fire Bird. Despite so, he still looked at the Fire Bird curiously as it circled around in mid-air while it absorbed the red gas around the Nirvanic Fruit bit by bit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped doing anything and just looked on as the Fire Bird swallowed the Nirvanic Fruit. It had been so long and the day for it to eat the fruit had finally come. He didn’t know what kind of changes will occur to the Fire Bird from eating the Nirvanic Fruit, but he was sure that it would definitely be really significant.</p>
 <p>Time went on little by little, this lasted for almost 40 days. The red gas around the Nirvanic Fruit was already getting weaker and weaker while the body of the Fire Bird in the air looked as if it was bloated with air and could burst at any time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui currently also felt really nervous. The chirping noise of the Fire Bird sounded really loud and clear. Its melodious chirping noise didn’t give people the slightest feeling of pain, it was a kind of cry filled with resolution to battle.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The body of the Fire Bird started to burn with surging flames. It was a type of flame which looked as black as ink, which also made its enormous body black in color. Looking at it in mid-air, it looked really stunning and beautiful.</p>
 <p>The aura emitted from its body was raising very quickly. Every time it ascended to a new grade, a rumbling noise would be heard and a sea of fire would appear. It was just that this sea of fire was black in color and somewhat gave people a chilly feeling.</p>
 <p>Hell’s Inferno. The legendary flame of hell. It was the fire source which could immediately burn souls.</p>
 <p>Again and again, the Fire Bird burst with black flames just like a butterfly which just went through metamorphosis. After the same thing happened a number of times only did Qing Shui start to pay attention. This was because he was able to feel a sense of danger from the Fire Bird now.</p>
 <p>Seven times!</p>
 <p>The whole thing only came to a stop after the Fire Bird evolved seven times. At this moment, the Fire Bird opened up both of its wings. They were almost 200 meters huge, as if they were able to cover up the entire sky and earth and its jet black body looked shockingly beautiful. In the past, Qing Shui had always known that black was a really nice-looking color, but he still never expected for there to be such a beautiful black color.</p>
 <p>In the past, he used to think that rainbow colors, gold color, blue color and even something with no color looked good. Until now only did Qing Shui come to understand that all colors looked nice, it was just that these colors needed to be in the purest form of their respective colors. For example, there were some yellow colors which would look really ugly whereas some would look nice, like golden yellow and earthy yellow colors.</p>
 <p>As of now, Qing Shui was having a really great feeling about the jet-black feathers of the Fire Bird. Compared to before, it looked more tyrannical and noble. There were lines across its body that was a symbol of its strength, and also gave a very powerful sense of beauty.</p>
 <p>It slowly calmed down. Qing Shui was really excited because he had already felt the powerful strength of the Fire Bird. He was really agitated with the fact that his demonic beasts had finally begun to walk up towards the stage for battling.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui sensed the strength of the Fire Bird and happily looked towards its abilities.</p>
 <p>At the moment, the raw strength of the Fire Bird had achieved 80,000 nimbus. In other words, it possessed a strength worth eight sun. Qing Shui felt that the aura emitted by the Fire Bird had already exceeded what the current Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant emitted. This time, the Nirvanic Fruit caused the Fire Bird to constantly evolve. Even though each time it evolved, the increase in strength wasn’t as significant as the breakthrough of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. However, when all seven times were stacked up together, the total amount of strength increased surpassed that of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s.</p>
 <p>Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens: Passive battle technique, zero consumption. Permanently increase raw strength by 50 folds. The consumptions for all battle techniques would be reduced by half.</p>
 <p>Superior Flight: A unique flying ability owned by the Fire Bird. It had exceptional speed and endurance. One of the best among all flying type demonic beasts. It could stay on high-speed flight for a long period of time.</p>
 <p>Hell’s Inferno: The Fire Bird unleashed a powerful fire attributed attack. The jet-black flame was capable of burning down everything and contained formidable destructive power. Legend has it that it was the powerful battle technique of the Black Phoenix.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens: Passive battle technique, permanently increase fire attributed attack by four folds. The damage it received would be reduced in folds. Zero consumption.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed as he looked up to this point. Under the effect of Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens, the Fire Bird’s attack would achieve a strength worth 2,000 sun. This had already exceeded the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s. For a moment, Qing Shui got extremely impatient. After all, it had been a long time since he last made the Fire Bird took part in any battles.</p>
 <p>Underworld Fireball: Unleash a fireball attack. It increased the user’s offensive strength by one fold. The fireball contained a terrifying explosive power. It could lock onto the opponent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t help but open up his mouth wide in shock. In this case, its offensive prowess would have achieved 4,000 sun. Furthermore, the attack could lock onto the opponent. Even though it could only aim at one opponent, its power was really tremendous. This made him to remember the enormous green dragon within his consciousness. The attack from the water dragon should also be equally as formidable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his demonic beasts had already transitioned to a whole new level. This time, the Fire Bird had awakened even more of the Dark Phoenix’s Bloodlines. Furthermore, its abilities had also increased significantly.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Paradies: Upon receiving a fatal damage, there was a 30% chance that the Fire Bird would activate Firebath Rebirth. Once it was successfully reborned, it would transform and its strength would increase by one fold.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird was flying around happily and spiralled around Qing Shui. Furthermore, it even communicated with him through the mind. This phenomenon shocked him because its intelligence had increased a lot.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if the Immortal Fairies in the world could turn into human. After all, only the beasts that had achieved the False God grade would turn into Immortal Fairies. However, even if they were unable to turn into humans, they would definitely not lose to them in terms of intelligence. All powerful demonic beasts would have intelligence which exceeded those of their same kind.</p>
 <p>Now, the Fire Bird already had intelligence. Naturally, this would help make its breakthrough faster in the future. Qing Shui had now begun to feel more confident within the Divine Might Dynasty. There were just too few people who would be capable to hurt the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was powerful in its battle techniques. The Fire Bird on the other hand, was had powerful wounding abilities. The Vajra Subdues Demon, Mighty Elephant Stomp, Diamond Sword Qi and so on of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant were all pretty good controlling battle techniques. The Underworld Fire Ball possessed by the Fire Bird on the other hand, had a formidable offensive power. The only thing about it was Qing Shui didn’t know if it would continue to upgrade in the future.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Gathering Lamp had lost its effect. This made Qing Shui felt a bit upset. He would refine them everyday in hope that the Spirit Gathering Lamp, Coiled Dragon State, Heaven-Shaking Drum would break through. If that happened, he would be able to stand at the top of the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>When time was almost up, Qing Shui left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was now already the latest part of the day. After 30 minutes, he would once again be able to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal</p>
 <p>The breakthrough of the Fire Bird this time was an accident. However, the surprise brought upon from this accident was too huge. In the future, the Fire Bird would be able to fight together with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Things would be getting more and more interesting later on.</p>
 <p>Even though the Nirvanic Fruit was gone, its spiritual root still remained. Before Qing Shui left, he retrieved two drops of the Spring of Life.</p>
