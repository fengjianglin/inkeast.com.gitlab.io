 <p><strong>AST 627 - The Success of Vital Essence Pill, Di Clan’s Visitor </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui decided to try it immediately. He would have a talk with that woman if he could successfully concoct it. This shouldn’t be the only recipe in her hands. To any alchemist, this woman was simply a priceless treasure.</p>
 <p>The recipe and the ingredients were already ready and in his hands. All he had to do now was to just concoct it, so he felt more relaxed about it.</p>
 <p>Although the ingredients were ready, Qing Shui still inspected them thoroughly. It wasn’t that he was worried the ingredients had problems, he was just worried that they might overlooked something.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Qing Shui was a little different than others when it came to concocting medicines. He could remove almost all the impurities in the medicinal ingredients. It was vital to know that it would be difficult for medicinal pills to form in the presence of any impurities.</p>
 <p>He rinsed the medicinal herbs once again and refined them before grouping them. He put a part of them into the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron while setting the rest aside, so they were ready to be added into the cauldron at any time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had to start concocting next. He felt very relaxed because the medicinal herbs weren’t too limited, unlike the previous time when he had to concoct some medicinal pills. Due to shortage of medicinal herbs back then, there was no room for failure.</p>
 <p>There were eighteen types of medicinal herbs in total and six of them had to be added first. The primordial flames burned with greater intensity after it had levelled up. This made him felt like he had more control when concocting medicines.</p>
 <p>After an hour, Qing Shui added some 1000 Year Earth Heart Lotus into the cauldron. The primordial flames were suddenly raised by a third, causing the bubbling noises to be even louder in the Golden Flint Cauldron. It was akin to the sound of water being boiled.</p>
 <p>After almost four hours, Qing Shui put in the last ‘Crystal Flowers’ and raised the fire’s intensity to eighty percent. The flames reached its peak within fifteen minutes.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A dull noise rang out!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui froze and cursed in his heart. An explosion had occurred during the final stages of pill formation. He didn’t know why was he suddenly distracted and why the fire intensity didn’t rise completely during that split moment.</p>
 <p>When he opened the lid, there was nothing but a faint green colored powder inside the Golden Flint Cauldron. Qing Shui got rid of it all and washed the Golden Flint Cauldron before putting it away.</p>
 <p>Four hours. His whole morning was wasted away just like that. Qing Shui felt extremely gloomy about it, he finally knew the frustration of failing in concoction now. He could see the time, effort and money that had been wasted. Although, he cheered up a little when he remembered the extremely low success rates of those alchemists in the Main Continent. Happiness came from comparisons.</p>
 <p>After taking a short break, Qing Shui immersed himself in concocting medicinal pills once again. The first round would always feel very unfamiliar. One would not only be more skillful, but also have a higher accuracy during the second round. Especially the old alchemists, who were already past their prime and had accumulated a few hundreds years of experience could still raise their success rates. Only the ones who were always diligent in concocting medicines. Although that’s an exception for the medicinal pills that are Royal Grade and above. No matter how many times those were concocted, their success rates would still remain very low. Even if it could be raised, it would only be raised by miniscule amounts.</p>
 <p>Other than experience, there were other factors. The cauldron, the medicinal ingredients and the type of flames were taken into account when it came to concocting medicine. Amongst these factors, experience accounted for twenty percent, the cauldron accounted for ten percent and the flame type for about thirty percent. The rest hinged on some extraordinary innate talents, such as Qing Shui’s formidable spiritual sense and spirit energy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s current success rate in concocting medicine was not by chance. He had the experience, as well as medicinal herbs and an abundance of time in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He was quite certain that there definitely wouldn’t be many who had a richer experience than him.</p>
 <p>It was unnecessary to mention about the Golden Flint Cauldron either</p>
 <p>(just an explanation: The success rate mentioned above is compared among the entire alchemy*. The increase in success rate by the Golden Flint Cauldron, for example by one-fold, as mentioned before was in comparison to other alchemy cauldrons. For example, if the success rate of other alchemy cauldrons were increased by ten percent, then it would be increased by twenty percent when using the Golden Flint Cauldron), because it was safe to say that Qing Shui had yet to find an alchemy cauldron that was superior than the Golden Flint Cauldron.</p>
 <p>The primordial flame was the flame of life between heaven and earth. It was definitely one of the finest types of flame. Qing Shui didn’t even feel that it was just high tier, but rather the very best. However, he could only manage put a small amount of the primordial flame’s potential to use right now.</p>
 <p>On top of the Yin Yang diagram and his formidable spiritual sense, Qing Shui almost never failed in concocting medicine.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>He smiled when he heard that melodious sound ringing out. It was a success! He couldn’t help but to think about that woman named Yuan Su. It seemed like she had more recipes in her hands, so he really needed to discuss with her. Perhaps even help her clear her closed up meridians, provided that she was willing to let him do so.</p>
 <p>That was because it required some degree of physical contact with the body in order to clear the meridians. They may even be some contact with private parts.</p>
 <p>When he opened the the Golden Flint Cauldron, a wave of sweet fragrance penetrated his mind, or to his very soul rather. It immediately stimulated his senses, just the smell of it alone had the effects of refreshing the mind. He wouldn’t be surprised if it restored the body’s condition instantly after consumption.</p>
 <p>The Vital Essence Pill was about the size of a thumb, dark green in color and completely translucent. Qing Shui picked up a porcelain bottle to store the pill and then placed his gaze on the arranged medicinal ingredients.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to concoct with all the ten portions of medicinal herbs that he’d prepared. Except for the failed attempt the first time, he succeeded in all the subsequent nine attempts. He was even able to concoct two pills within a single round. He could tell that his alchemy had went up by another level with just that.</p>
 <p>Next, Qing Shui took a walk around the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Thunderous Beast followed him around, it seemed to be very fond and attached to him. He looked at the beast, which didn’t seem to have much change in its size. Although it hadn’t been growing in size too much, its strength was rapidly increasing. The rate of its increase was fast that it even left Qing Shui a little speechless. He knew that other than the Thunderous Beast’s innate talents, it was inextricably linked to the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus somehow.</p>
 <p>This was his demonic beast that would become his capable sidekick in the World of the Nine Continents one day. Qing Shui continued looking at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird from a distance. Although he couldn’t be like Luan Luan who could possessed an enormous fleet of demonic beasts, every single one of his demonic beasts were extraordinary and retained a lot of room for potential improvements.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>He spent the next day peacefully. Qing Shui didn’t go look for Yuan Su, instead stayed at the Four Seas Inn to help Di Chen stabilize her strength with the easiest method.</p>
 <p>He held both of Di Chen’s hands in his , he then circulated that unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique just like the other day!</p>
 <p>That strange feeling transmitted between the two of them. This was an effect of the ‘Duo Cultivation’ that could stabilize a realm. After receiving an increase in strength for the first time, it would gradually decrease over time until there was no increase in strength. In return, this could stabilize the realm. So as long as the strength was increased, then it could achieve the effects of stabilizing the realm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would never get tired of this odd and intimate sensation. Di Chen was amused too, she was already deeply connected to Qing Shui without realizing it. They could even do some acts of intimacy with each other quite easily. Of course, it was limited to only holding each other’s hands and some occasional embraces. They’d usually break apart as soon as they came in contact. That moment of warmth felt particularly wonderful.</p>
 <p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye. A series of knocks rang out close to noon. Qing Shui opened the door and saw a familiar face.</p>
 <p>Di Qing!</p>
 <p>Although, he soon realized that there was a man behind Di Qing. Yup, a man. He was tall and well built, but not too tough-looking. His towering height wasn’t intimidating either. He had a handsome appearance that exuded a very refined aura.</p>
 <p>A faint smile appeared on the man’s face, “Hello, may we enter?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded and stepped aside, “Please come in!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>“Big sister, look at who’s here to visit you!” Di Qing shouted towards Di Chen, who was inside.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know who this man was, but he could sense that this man was very strong. He remembered someone when he looked at the man’s forehead, which looked a little similar to Di Qing.</p>
 <p>In the past, Di Qing had mentioned about a person from Di Clan among their generation. One with outstanding talent and cultivation of a powerful Martial Saint. He was Di Qing’s big brother!</p>
 <p>“Qing’er!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen called out happily when she came out. She was a little unsure when she saw the man, and then it was as if something dawned on her as she called out in uncertainty, “Big brother!”</p>
 <p>“Chen’er, you still remember big brother!”</p>
 <p>The man placed his gaze on Qing Shui after finishing his sentence, “So you’re Qing Shui, right? It’s a great pleasure to meet you, I am Di Fentian, their big brother.”</p>
 <p>“How do you do? I am Qing Shui,” he smiled and greeted back.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for taking care of Chen’er all this time,” Di Fentian smiled courteously.</p>
 <p>“No need to thank me, she’s is my wife after all. Moreover, it’s Chen’er who had always been taking care of me. Even if there’s a need to thank someone, it should be me thanking her. Besides, no one has the rights to thank someone on her behalf,” Qing Shui remembered about what Qing Qing had been through and felt like he’d fallen short of her. Now he thought that Di Clan was even worse than the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>Di Fentian was startled before he laughed bitterly, “You’re right. The Di Clan indeed have no rights. Chen’er, big brother didn’t even know that you had already married. Congratulations on finding your ideal husband.”</p>
 <p>The man didn’t say anything and only congratulated Di Chen after hearing Qing Shui’s words!</p>
 <p>“Follow big brother and return home. I’ll repay what I’ve owed you for so many years in double. What do you say?” The man was clearly very happy as he spoke enthusiastically.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked at her elder brother who was considerably older than her. He was a very nice elder brother in her memories. She remembered that it was her big brother who wouldn’t let her leave the Di Clan in the past. In the end though, he was taken away by father and grandfather. However, he would visit her at the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord from time to time….</p>
 <p>“Big brother, I was thrown out of the Di Clan. Why do I want to return?” Di Chen shook her head and said indifferently.</p>
 <p>The man was startled as a a look of pain flashed across his face. He looked at Di Chen, “Chen’er. Father actually loves you a lot. He was more upset than anyone else when he had to make this decision. Do you know why he had never visited you at the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord after that? It’s not that he didn’t go, but he was secretly watching you when he went there. He would basically go at least once a month. Even when you went to the Greencloud Continent, he’d still go there to see you every year.”</p>
 <p>Di Chen was shocked. Why hasn’t she thought of this before? The father who had always cherished her since she was little. That father who was imposing and omnipotent. Why would her father, who had always doted on her, turned so cold that he wouldn’t even visit her? It wasn’t that he never visited, it turned out that she was just clueless about it.</p>
 <p>“Return with me. The current Di Clan is strong enough to oppose him now. Father strongly wishes for you to return too. He even wanted to come here personally, but he was afraid that you’d feel pressured. To be honest, ever since you came to the Central Continent, he’d been watching you at least once every three days.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt his back getting cold at the man’s words. At least he now knew why he felt a little weird at times now. That strange feeling had always vanished so quickly that he always brushed it off as his imagination. It turned out that they were actually being watched.</p>
 <p>Just what kind of strength did this man, whom Di Chen called father, possess...?</p>
 <p>“Him? Who are you talking about?” Di Chen asked the man in confusion.</p>
