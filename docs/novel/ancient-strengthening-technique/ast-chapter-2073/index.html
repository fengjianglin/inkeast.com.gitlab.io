 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 2073 - A Woman’s Mind, Back to the Northern Blue Domain</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once one of them was injured, Qing Shui no longer had any desires to continue fighting. Besides, he had more or less achieved his own objective. The battle had proven to be very effective for his own hardening and the Golden Battle Halberd in his hands was able to pierce through its target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The charm of Iaido was now translated into the use of the Golden Battle Halberd. Qing Shui used to practice the art of Iaido for decades and had never forgotten about it even after many years. Now that his realm had increased tenfold from what it used to be, the power of a single blow had naturally increased in proportion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A stroke of a Large Golden Dragon Palm Imprint was delivered from the Golden Battle Halberd, holding the last man in its clutches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Using the Golden Battle Halberd to summon the Dragon-capturing Hands, he was able to lock down his opponents in just a moment. In additions, Iaido was used with the Golden Battle Halberd to land its mark on the man’s chest. Its impact sent the man flying backwards with blood and organs gushing out from the wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While it wouldn’t have finished off his opponent, he would never regain his cultivation in this lifetime either. At best, he could recover up to half of his current capabilities. Qing Shui would show no mercy to those who aided tyrants. At times, these people were pitiful but where there was sympathy, there existed factors to hate. For example, if Huo Lei needed women, the two men would capture one on sight for Huo Lei to abuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In smaller territories like the former Hundred Miles City, these people were just runners. However, at the Blazing Fire Land of the Haohan Continent, they were a part of a big clan. Hence, these runners had a high status here and were also very capable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui retracted his hand and looked back at Shen Huang, saying, "Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang nodded and said, "Let’s get out of here quick. I want to go back. There are still things I have to deal with."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Shen Huang was worried about the possibility of other Fire Manor members returning. The people who would arrive after this must be terrifying in strength so it was wise to leave now while they could. Even so, this woman wouldn’t allow herself to flee. She didn’t wish to leave here as if escaping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mm. Now that I’ve beaten them up, it’s time to go. They won’t be able to catch up with us." Qing Shui flashed a smile at Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was relieved, and a happy smile appeared on her face. This man was generous and open-minded, not at all petty and much less arrogant. He wasn’t pedantic either. This was nothing even for Qing Shui’s past life, but to flee during chaos was still embarrassing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t find it shameful. On the contrary; sometimes, one would be a fool not to run away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a reach of his hand to hold Shen Huang’s, he felt her pull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From that gesture, Qing Shui understood immediately. The woman wasn’t the same as she was before. A person’s mind would broaden when at the brink of death; what used to be an impossible task would suddenly seem resolvable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was reminded of the previous life when a man—an ordinary man—who had an inferiority complex and never dared to confess to the girl he adored. Due to his low self-esteem, despite the many times he had attempted, he could never confess and was utterly convinced that she would never accept him. After all the effort he went through, he still couldn’t make himself confess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, change was the only constant with life. The man had eventually been diagnosed with leukemia and without much time left in the world. When it happened, all his concerns seemed to have dulled and he didn’t care anymore. Even a confession to the girl didn’t seem like a difficult task anymore. It paled in comparison to the worries of life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another case that was akin to this, except this person’s terminal illness and short prognosis were a mere lie. Hence, once he was declared healthy, his personality took a complete turn. He was a lot more cheerful than before. He became more positive, his skills had improved and he was more daring. He was a completely different person from the man who used to be afraid of speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These incidents were also applicable to the martial world. Many would have an epiphany when tethering on the edge of life and death, changing the course of their fate in a split second. The fine line between life and death was also the easiest to break through. However, while escaping death was possible, the rate of success was less than 1 percent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, going through a close call was a blessing in disguise. Whether it was the former technology world, or the current World of the Nine Continents, people who had survived a close call would gain a great deal in return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What had just happened allowed Shen Huang to achieve so much more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had planned to let go of her hand when he noticed Shen Huang's expression and understood how she felt. He didn't know what it would mean for him to let go but he didn’t want to put her on a difficult spot after witnessing her expression and the subtle reaction to his touch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly, Qing Shui let go of her hand, only to be stopped by Shen Huang, clutching onto his hand in a tight grip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's wrong? Why are you letting go when you’ve held onto my hand for the past few days?" Shen Huang asked Qing Shui with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed. "You might have been affected by the threat earlier but you’re fine now. I know that this incident will embed me a little deeper in your mind, but I could still feel the shred of hesitance. I want you to be happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, Qing Shui. I don’t know if I love you, but you’re definitely the most important person in my life." Shen Huang answered earnestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, Qing Shui landed at Dazang City with Shen Huang in tow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the point that he had set their destination for earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing as New Year celebrations were still going on, the air was filled thickly with the festivity. In just a few days, Shen Huang had experienced a crucial turning point in her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Miss, are you going back to the Imperial Cuisine Hall with me?" Qing Shui asked shortly arriving in Dazang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmh, I will stay for a few days before returning to Phoenix City." Shen Huang answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If there is something you have to tend to, you can go back first. Otherwise, I can escort you." Qing Shui had the Nine Continents Steps Effect, and would take him no time at all to reach Phoenix City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unexpectedly, Shen Huang nodded. "Let us head back to the Imperial Cuisine Hall first then. We can go back for a visit before returning to Phoenix Inn. I still owe you my gratitude after all, so let me treat you to a drink."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall and Big Tiger was elated. Nothing had happened in the past few days and the Imperial Cuisine Hall had already opened its doors for business. Due to what had happened previously, the Imperial Cuisine Hall became the most renowned in the Azure Rainbow City. There was no one in Azure Rainbow City who would provoke either the Imperial Cuisine Hall or the Yu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that the Zhan Clan had no power in this territory while the relationship between the Ji Clan and the Imperial Cuisine Hall was good. It was the Ji Clan, one of strongest clans in the Northern Blue Domain, that we were talking about. Furthermore, it was rumored that the Imperial Cuisine Hall had a good relationship with a few other powerful clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You couldn’t stay in such a place for long. Qing Shui had only been in Azure Rainbow City for a short while, but as much as it was a good layover, it wasn’t suitable for a long stay. Perhaps he would relocate the Qing Clan here in the future, or maybe it would never happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not in favor of allowing members of the Qing Clan to be involved in this power struggle. If was fine for him to be caught up in it alone, but he didn’t wish to implicate the other members of the Qing Clan. Even so, some things were unpredictable, just like how you couldn’t always do as you wished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had come to accept this unpleasant fact, just like his women. Some would keep up with him while others would not. This applied to his children as well. With time, it was inevitable that they would begin to drift and separate from him. This was a fact that couldn’t be changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could only work hard at the foundation of all that was possible, and spare himself from any regrets in the future. His descendants would one day have descendants of their own. They would have to train well and increase their skills as Qing Shui would not be able to protect them forever. They would have their own lives to lead in the future, with their own circle of alliance, and their own effort to boot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood. He would not plan for his children’s lives; he could only give them some form of insurance and prevent others from bullying them. He would respect their decisions and give them his own set of conditions, such as training. He would give them the best possible foundation. As to how high they could build it up, it would have to depend on their own destinies.</span></p>
