 <p><strong>AST 702 - Bringing Good Fortune to the Husband? Consuming the Everlasting Pellet in the palace in the Deity Cave of Immortal</strong></p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast's growth was currently not on Qing Shui’s list of priorities. He wasn't worried about it. With the existence of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, there was no need to stress about it anymore, good things were always worth waiting for.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Qing Shui owned other strong demonic beasts like the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Fire Bird, Jade Emperor Queen Bee, and the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies. Thus, the most important thing right now was to increase his own strength.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui finally exited, it was already mid-afternoon. Right after he walked out, he saw Hai Dongqing feeding the Silver Spirit Beast the Beast Pill. When she noticed that Qing Shui had come out, Hai Dongqing seemed especially happy.</p>
 <p>“How did it go? Did it succeed?” &nbsp;Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui with concern and asked.</p>
 <p>“En, with the big miss of the Hai Clan here, I will be successful in every endeavor.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>This sentence caused Hai Dongqing to blush because what Qing Shui was talking about referred to a certain situation in the World of the Nine Continents. Women, who brought fortune to their husbands, were sometimes compared to lucky charms.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui did not read too much into this, he only watched that huge Silver Spirit Beast. After consuming the Beast Pill, its abilities experienced a significant increase, which made Hai Dongqing incredibly happy.</p>
 <p>In regards to drugs, demonic beasts were less susceptible to them than humans, this was why demonic beasts were very strong. Even the drug resistance within the human race differed. Everyone is different from each other, their constitution and abilities could never be absolutely identical.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing’s abilities appeared to be significantly bolstered, but they were still weaker, that the Silver Spirit Beast's. She now also possessed the perversely strong Luan Silver Battle Dress Set. With this set, she could increase her abilities by one fold and possibly execute moves that were many times more powerful than before.</p>
 <p>“Let’s leave this place first and go to the Deity Cave of Immortal. We can stay there for a period of time. We will go back later, alright?” Qing Shui smiled at Hai Dongqing as he said.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing nodded her head, she discovered that she had unknowingly been obeying the words of this man, it even got to the point of becoming a habit, a habit of depending on him, a habit of letting him make the decisions…...</p>
 <p>This realization horrified her, she had always been an independent woman. When she was in the Greencloud Continent, she was the pillar of the Hai Clan, the biggest trump card of the Hai Clan.</p>
 <p>Since she arrived at the Central Continent, her peers were also among the peak existences. The independent character, that she had nurtured was not so easy to change, even though she seemed to become more amiable.</p>
 <p>She discovered, that she was actually starting to change, she would make her own decisions for everything in the past, but now she became lazy. She felt, that this way she did not have to bear all the responsibility. The feeling of not having to spend all her energy on worrying about everything was great, was this the feeling of reliance?</p>
 <p>She had never thought, that she would rely on someone nor had she wanted to rely on someone ever before. She had her pride instilled deep within herself. It could be said, that she was as prideful as any other man.</p>
 <p>However, now she learned, that this feeling of reliance was pretty good, it felt much better that managing everything by herself and fighting by her lonesome. She felt a lot more relaxed in her heart.</p>
 <p>“I’ll just let myself relax during this period of time!” Hai Dongqing told herself.</p>
 <p>The time to go back was at hand. They arrived back at the Deity Cave of Immortal in two days time. This place was the same as before but their feelings were different, especially those of Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>The Luan Silver Battle Dress Set she was wearing now was acquired here, as well as the Silver Spirit Beast beside her, thus she felt very close to this place.</p>
 <p>When they arrived here, it was already night, so they took a rest. Just like in the past, Hai Dongqing was inside and Qing Shui was outside, Qing Shui would release demonic beasts to stand guard while he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>The leftover materials from the Five Tailed Immortal Fox were already disposed of by Qing Shui. The corpse of the Skywolf was also refined already. The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal could contain many of these large demonic beasts, the Interspatial Silk Sachet would definitely not be able to do that. The difference in storage space between the two was incomparable, furthermore, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal could be used for more than storage, storage was just the most basic ability it had.</p>
 <p>However, just this ability alone would be able to cause anyone to go crazy with jealousy. This gave the owner a feeling of superiority, allowing Qing Shui to feel even more gratified.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui had nothing else to do, he finished dealing with the skin of the Five Tailed Immortal Fox. He intended to use it to make fox fur coats. Forging weapons and armor were some of Qing Shui’s hobbies. He enjoyed watching when something became nicer, more practical to use and more refined in his hands. He loved seeing the people around him wearing the armor he made and wielding the weapons he forged.</p>
 <p>Thinking of his children in the Greencloud Continent, and the women he loved, Qing Shui felt, that he owed them too much. This was just a feeling he had since none of them had any regrets and lived happy lives.</p>
 <p>As for his mother, Qing Shui always knew, that he thought of her as the noblest person in the world and that she loved him with the most selfless kind of love there was.</p>
 <p>Thinking of them, Qing Shui felt very peaceful, they were Qing Shui’s mental support, his motivation, even more so, his family and loved ones, they were his spiritual refuge.</p>
 <p>He tempered the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb, Demon Binding Ropes, and Soulshake bell, refined medicine, and poison…...</p>
 <p>Fermenting wine, cultivating and researching the culinary arts. He also cultivated the Mighty Elephant Stomp and researched healing medicine, especially those with a strong effect. When he had an opportunity, he wanted to meet Yuan Su to see if she had any such alchemy recipes.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Mighty Elephant Stomp had been stuck in the large success stage for a long time, he hoped that when they go to the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent///////, he and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would be able to break through to the Grand Perfection Stage of the Mighty Elephant Stomp, this way they would increase their strength significantly.</p>
 <p>Back Connecting Fist, Taichi Fist…...</p>
 <p>The Back Connecting Fist did not undergo a breakthrough for quite a while, Qing Shui knew that that was because he had often neglected it. He spent most of his time on the Taichi Fist during practice.</p>
 <p>“In the further, I can practice the Back Connecting Fist before exercising the Taichi Fist.” Qing Shui told himself.</p>
 <p>The plants in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal grew strong and healthy, the Flower of Life, Five Elements Fruit, Mysterious Fruit Tree, Five Elements Fruit, Peach of Immortality, Vermillion Fruit…...</p>
 <p>He used some of the Qianji Wood, that he obtained earlier. He also planted it in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. For now, there were no significant changes to it.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the 1000-year Gloomy Wood had sprouted into a small tree, Qing Shui did not know if the so-called magic weapon or treasure could be refined, but he would try it when he had the opportunity.</p>
 <p>He had also accumulated some Phoenix Tail Grass, he also stopped refining the Great Revitalizing Pellet. Because of its limitations, Qing Shui did not have much use for it, unless he would be able to refine the Great Revitalizing Pellet of the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew, that the World of the Nine Continents had a version of the Great Revitalizing Pellet. Although its effects were not able to revive the dead, it could heal any wounds, as long as one is not dead, they could recover. It was one of the holy medicines of the World of the Nine Continents, a holy item for healing people.</p>
 <p>Thinking of that miraculous effect, Qing Shui looked forward to it. Although he already had the holy item, Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, a holy item stronger than the Great Revitalizing Pellet, such treasure took a long time to regenerate every time he used it.</p>
 <p>That cluster of fire-red grass could be called a small tree now, it was about 33 cm tall, it was as thick as a finger, its branches were full of leaves and it stood straight and strong, it was so small yet it had such strong vitality.</p>
 <p>Its color was even more fiery-red than before, from a distance, it looked like a clump of flames.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird would visit it every day, Qing Shui felt very suspicious. He did not know what kind of grass was it but he knew that this grass would be of great help to the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>Since he could not understand it, he stopped thinking about it, he would gradually find out more about it in the future.</p>
 <p>The second day, Qing Shui completed his morning practice. Hai Dongqing already prepared breakfast.</p>
 <p>“Miss Hai, please take my guard duty at the entrance today. I can’t be disturbed today, I leave this matter in your hands.” Qing Shui said after eating.</p>
 <p>“En, sure!”</p>
 <p>He summoned all the demonic beasts he had, including all the Jade Emperor Bees. Qing Shui would not allow himself to be disturbed this time. He repeatedly reminded Hai Dongqing that regardless of whatever happened, she cannot come in.</p>
 <p>Within the palace in the Deity Cave of Immortal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui adjusted his body’s state to its most optimum before taking out the Everlasting Pellet. In the past, Qing Shui would not dare to casually consume this pill, pills of this grade could easily cause one to explode and die because the energy contained in the pill was too strong.</p>
 <p>It was because of this reason, that Qing Shui thought of the Deity Statue, he wanted to use the pressure of the Deity Statue to suppress the energy in the pill. Although he was confident in the strength of his body, he was still afraid of accidents.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>State of Immovable as Mountains!</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly circulated all the techniques in his body before slowly taking ten steps into the huge pressure. It was only after this then he opened the bottle containing the Everlasting Pellet and swallowed it.</p>
 <p>It melted in his mouth, very soon, it was digested by the techniques that Qing Shui circulated. In that instant, the weak energy turned strong and circulated in his body, that might of the energy and the speed at which it was raised surprised Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He calmed himself down and focused!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed both his eyes and slowly absorbed the significant medicinal strength. Slowly, Qing Shui felt as though his body was going to explode, at this moment, Qing Shui had chosen to take a step forward.</p>
 <p>The external compressive pressure would counteract the explosive force in his body. This way, Qing Shui could conserve his energy. Although the feeling of exploding was lesser that earlier, it was even more dangerous. Once the external force was unable to control the internal explosive force, then he would explode and die.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had chosen this spot because he felt that the compressive force here would be sufficient, this way, it would eliminate the danger of it not being able to control the explosive force. Furthermore, this method would allow him to absorb the medicinal strength of the medicinal pill more effectively.</p>
 <p>The Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness was rapidly circulating, sending out even stronger spirit energy and godly energy to reinforce the meridians, bones, muscles, and the organs of the body.</p>
 <p>Just like this, when Qing Shui felt that he could no longer withstand it, he would take another step forward. His body’s abilities were rapidly improving, this rate of improvement caused Qing Shui to be happy, but it was a danger that placed his life at risk.</p>
 <p>Thirty steps!</p>
 <p>Forty Steps!</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already lost count of the number of steps he had taken, but he had surpassed his previous limits, however, with his increase in strength, he should be able to take more steps than he did before.</p>
 <p>Ka Cha…...</p>
 <p>There was a clear sound coming from his bones, although the strength of his body was increased significantly, Qing Shui was not able to be happy, he felt, that the energy in his body had not reached its peak yet. At this rate, even though the compressive pressure could suppress the energy in his body, his body would not be able to withstand the terrifying pressure.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already forgotten the number of steps he had taken, there was a thin layer of blood covering his body!</p>
 <p>Ka!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s shoulder sank in!</p>
 <p>His bone broke, feeling helpless, Qing Shui took another step forward, or else his Dantian and meridians would explode and cause him to die.</p>
