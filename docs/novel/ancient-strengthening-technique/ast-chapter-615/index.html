 <p><strong>AST 615 - Towards the Seven Stars Country Once Again, Golden Light Eagle</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was well aware of the importance which the last sentence held - the Duanmu Clan couldn’t compare with the Village of Longevity!</p>
 <p>He had originally thought that the Seven Stars Country was not a very powerful existence. Now it seemed like the trip to Di Clan might not be that smooth of a ride. No matter for what reason it was, for the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord to be eliminated by Qing Shui was a disgrace in itself. Since it was one of the Seven Stars,.</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu nodded with a smile when she saw Qing Shui’s expression. She didn’t really say anything else, but the look of admiration in her eyes was visible.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, senior!” Qing Shui expressed his sincere gratitude to Lady Duanmu.</p>
 <p>“You’re welcome. If we were going to be courteous, I would have to thank you every single day. It’s late now, so you should leave tomorrow instead. Remember to send a letter to the Duanmu Clan if anything happens.” Yu Ruyan told Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>In the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui was drawing the ‘Hundred Forms of the Tiger’. He was still currently at the level of ‘drawing flesh and blood’, but he had been making progressive improvements.</p>
 <p>He had spent a lot of time observing the manner of the portrayed Tiger Form. He felt like he had gained a new insight to his Tiger Form cultivation without even realizing it. Although, to have any breakthroughs on Tiger Form now, was as difficult as ascending the heavens.</p>
 <p>He didn’t make much progress on talisman drawing either, so he figured he might as well stop learning to draw new talismans. Other than spending most of his time on drawing the ‘Hundred Forms of the Tiger’, he spent the rest of his time drawing random talismans.</p>
 <p>He felt that he’d already reached a bottleneck at Grade Four Heavenly Talismans. He currently placed his hopes on drawing this ‘Hundred Forms of the Tiger’. He had a feeling that breaking through the level of drawing flesh and blood should be able to bring his talisman drawing to another level as well.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>“Be careful on your journey, and remember what I’ve told you,” Lady Duanmu and Yu Ruyan reminded Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Take care of yourself, Sister Chen!”</p>
 <p>“You too!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang bidded farewell to Di Chen and Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Take care of yourself senior.” Qing Shui chuckled. He then climbed on Fire Bird with Di Chen, waved goodbye, and quickly disappeared out of their sight.</p>
 <p>“Lingshuang, he’s gone.” Yu Ruyan murmured softly to her daughter.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Duanmu Lingshuang looked at Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“Are you sad?”</p>
 <p>“Why do I have to be sad?” Duanmu Lingshuang asked while looking at Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“Haven’t you noticed how much you’ve changed? Lass, perhaps you haven’t realized it, but you will very soon. When that time comes, you must tell mother if you wish to discuss about it with me.” Yu Ruyan held Duanmu Lingshuang’s hand as they started walking back.</p>
 <p>“If that day comes, I will definitely do that,” Duanmu Lingshuang said with a mischievous smile as she hugged Yu Ruyan’s arm. Yu Ruyan was the only one who could see her occasional childish side and her wintry smile.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Fire Bird steadily flew over Duanmu City at a high speed!</p>
 <p>The Dongguo Clan of the Duanmu City!</p>
 <p>“Third Master, that male and female pair from the Duanmu Clan have already left. They’re flying towards the northeast direction as we speak.” A youth quickly ran to a courtyard and reported this to Third Master Dongguo.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I got it,” a smile appeared on the old Third Master Dongguo’s face. That smile gradually turned into a sinister grin, and then into an evil laugh.</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>A clear cry rang out as an enormous gold sparkling eagle appeared in the sky.</p>
 <p>A Golden Light Eagle!</p>
 <p>Its entire body was covered by golden feathers and had a wingspan greater than thirty metres. This type of demonic beast was a Grade One Martial Saint, but it had an exceptional ability of flight.</p>
 <p>“Brats, no one can ever escape from the clutches of I, the Third Master!” Third Master Dongguo mumbled to himself.</p>
 <p>Just then, a middle aged man who looked especially wretched appeared. His eyes were as pitch black as a mouse, he was hairy, he had a flat nose and thick lips. He walked to the side of the Third Master and bowed, “Third Master, are you sure that you want to lay a finger on that kid?”</p>
 <p>“Shang Jiu, you think that brat shouldn’t be touched?” Third Master Dongguo looked at the man who had the wretched appearance. He seemed to highly regard this man’s opinion. He would ask for his opinion even if he had already made his decision,.</p>
 <p>“Third Master, there will be no issues if you aren’t concerned about the Duanmu Clan.”</p>
 <p>“What if I am concerned?” If Third Master couldn’t be concerned, then he naturally wouldn’t need to be. If he was powerful enough, he would’ve already snatched those girls from the Duanmu Clan long ago.</p>
 <p>“If Third Master can take care of this cleanly without leaving any evidence, then they can’t do anything about it. Even the Duanmu Clan wouldn’t rashly offend the Dongguo Clan due to it’s relationship between the other clans. Furthermore, they aren’t going to come to us if this gets handled properly. What could they do even if they came to us? Neither the live nor the dead bodies of those people would be found.”</p>
 <p>A satisfied smile appeared on Third Master Dongguo’s face upon hearing the wretched man’s words.</p>
 <p>No one was aware that the Third Master Dongguo was someone who dual cultivated using women as a furnace. So he was definitely someone who was great at looking at women. The moment he first laid his eyes on Di Chen, he knew he had found hope in breaking through the Grade Six Martial Saint which he’d been trying for so long.</p>
 <p>As long as he could breakthrough, his position would be even higher among the Dongguo Clan. The clan would also gain another powerful figure. This meant that Dongguo Clan would have more rights to speak among the Four Clans Alliance.</p>
 <p>For this very reason, Third Master Dongguo was willing to try even when he was risking offending the Duanmu Clan. He had been stuck at Grade Six Martial Saint for about fifty years. He didn’t want to wait any longer or else he would be like this for the rest of his life. He still hadn’t given up on breaking through and setting his foot into that realm.</p>
 <p>He had the confidence in taking care of them cleanly. He was even thinking of taking care of them cleanly. After he found out that Shang Jiu held the same view, he was even more determined to go through with it.</p>
 <p>“Travel safe Third Master!” Shang Jiu bowed at Third Master Dongguo, who had climbed onto the Golden Light Eagle.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>“My Lady!”</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Yu Ruyan’s voice rang out!</p>
 <p>“Third Master Dongguo is chasing Mister Qing on the Golden Light Eagle!”</p>
 <p>“I see. You may leave!”</p>
 <p>“Understood!”</p>
 <p>“Third Master Dongguo, you’re courting death! It’s time for you to die, you can’t blame anyone else but yourself.” Yu Ruyan slowly said after a long while.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Chen had already been flying for a day. They’d already made it out of the city by nightfall. They could’ve arrived at the next city in another two hours, but Qing Shui felt it was better to camp outside the city since it was more convenient to make food that way.</p>
 <p>“Let’s camp out here tonight, the environment is quite nice as well.”</p>
 <p>He looked around at the endless wilderness surrounding him. His field of vision was very wide. There were some patches of green vegetation, but it was mostly dense wilderness around them with a few barren hills in the distance.</p>
 <p>The night had just arrived and the bright moon had risen from the west. He could see a few small wild beasts roaming about under the moonlight.</p>
 <p>A bonfire was lit. The pot of fish soup placed over it started boiling with hot steam.</p>
 <p>Di Chen wasn’t wearing her veil. She seemed to be in deep in thought as she sat beside Qing Shui in silence and didn’t utter a single word. Her beautiful face was peerlessly divine under the illuminated moonlight.</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking so hard about? It’s dinner time,” Qing Shui gently said.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do you think a father would love his daughter forever? Would he still pamper her as he did when she was little?” Di Chen was still deep in thought as she questioned softly.</p>
 <p>“He definitely will. A daughter is her father’s lover in past life. So a father will spoil his daughter the most in this life. That is, until she meets her husband, who will continue to spoil her in her father’s place.” Qing Shui answered with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, will you spoil your daughter until she grows up and gets married?” Di Chen raised her head to look at Qing Shui with her clear eyes.</p>
 <p>“Of course! I will make her the happiest and most blessed person.” Qing Shui knew that Di Chen’s heart would be more conflicted the closer they were to the Seven Stars Country. He didn’t know why she was asking these questions.”</p>
 <p>“You’re a good person. That smells nice, I’m so hungry,” Di Chen smiled back at him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry. He picked up the jade porcelain bowls that he’d prepared. Jade stones weren’t especially valuable in the World of the Nine Continents, so most of the rich would choose to eat with jade porcelain bowls. They were clean and attractive-looking, they even had the ability to absorb toxic substances.</p>
 <p>They chatted leisurely for a little, but Qing Shui knew that she must’ve been feeling very conflicted right now. They were about to arrive at the place which was once very familiar to her. She didn’t exhibit the feeling of returning after wandering for so long, but that place still felt especially close and dear to her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui released the Diamond Gigantic Elephant at night and entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique had broken through another two cycles over this period of time. He had gained a small amount of strength, which was better than nothing, so he was still a little pleased about it.</p>
 <p>Without realizing it, he had already spent half of his time in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui was about to draw some talismans when he suddenly sensed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s distress call. He didn’t feeling like taking any chances, so he immediately exit the realm.</p>
 <p>As soon as he came out, he could feel a wave of powerful aura rapidly approaching from the sky above, and it wasn’t too far away!</p>
 <p>A Martial Saint!</p>
 <p>A very familiar one on top of that!</p>
 <p>Third Master Dongguo!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked out of his tent. Before he could do anything else, he saw a familiar figure riding a gigantic Golden Light Eagle - Third Master Dongguo.</p>
 <p>He smiled at Third Master Dongguo, “What a coincidence for us to meet here in during dead of the night. This is fate indeed.”</p>
 <p>Di Chen came over too. She raised her head up to look at Third Master Dongguo and then at Qing Shui, who gave her a nod. She then slowly walked to the side of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant nearby.</p>
