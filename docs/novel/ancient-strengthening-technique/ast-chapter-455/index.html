 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 455 - The Sudden Increase of Strength, The Strength of Two and Half Countries, Ecstasy</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Divine Feet Clearing, Great Perfection Stage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Chengshan, Feiyang, Weiyang, Yinggu, Taixi, Dazhong, Huantiao, Fengshi, Zhongdu, Yangjiao, Guangming, Xuanzhong, Qiuxu, Ququan and Ligou: these 15 acupoints on both of his legs were immediately emitting powerful energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui felt his bones and meridians being immensely reinforced. The Taixi acupoint strengthened the lower back and invigorated the bones. The Huantiao acupoint reinforced the meridians and increased its flexibility.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The energy exuding from his legs right now made him wanted to jump around wildly. Both his strength and speed had gained a tremendous increase.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before, the Divine Feet Clearing of Great Perfection Stage could increase 300,000 jin of strength. However, it seemed to be no less than 500,000 jin now, which made Qing Shui extremely happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had been 4.5 million jin of enormous strength before. With this additional 500,000 jin of strength, Qing Shui’s body strength was now an enormous 5 million jin of strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was feeling the additional strength within his body and felt extremely satisfied in his heart. Qing Shui had been restless ever since he had found out about the disparities between him and a peak Martial King grade from the Old Ancestor. Because of this, his yearning towards strength burned even more intensely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s figure could be seen trampling on the same inch of land beneath his feet in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. It was so fast that both of his legs had become a blur. He didn’t stop until half an hour later.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He smiled in satisfaction. “The speed has indeed increased by quite a lot. At least 10% or more!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui raised his qi aura!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Essence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By now, his body had already achieved an enormous strength of about 5,000,000 jin. This stomp would have the strength of about two and a half countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bam!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A gigantic noise rang out. Even though he was in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, a deep ditch of about 5 metres long was created. Luckily, this was an empty field and the ground on top of it was very quickly restored back to its original state.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Humphh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Fire Bird and the Demonic Diamond Boar let out a loud cry at the gigantic noise, as if trying to respond. The Demonic Diamond Boar, big as a bull by now, quickly rushed over and affectionately circled around Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt extremely happy looking at his darling pet. It almost didn’t look like a boar at all now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elephant?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had never really paid close attention to it before, but now, he suddenly realised that it looked similar to a little golden elephant. The only difference was its trunk which was a little shorter and its ears which were slightly smaller.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He shook his head. Without those characteristics he previously mentioned, it still resembled a boar more than an elephant. If it could evolve once more in the future and become a massive golden boar, it would be very powerful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui imagined a sparkly golden massive boar which was about five or six meters long with the height of two or three meters and a body sturdy like steel. It would possess extraordinary strength. He was sure that it would be able to create caves in a mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He reached over to pat on his Demonic Diamond Boar. Fortunately, Qing Shui had telepathically told it the things it could and could not touch. Otherwise, it would have demolished all medical herbs here as if they were cabbages…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He suddenly recalled that he had reaped quite a lot of benefits when he had tamed this Demonic Diamond Boar with the Divine Marionette. He had gained an ten percent increase of all its strengths.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immersed his mind on his dantian and discovered that there was a lump of “golden” energy somewhere there that had yet to be dispersed. It was as if they were clumping together, which made Qing Shui extremely puzzled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could this be the energy bestowed to him by the Demonic Diamond Boar after it broke through?” Qing Shui mulled over it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I should try to dissolve it and see if I can maybe gain a large amount of energy!” He could feel some energy contained within that golden air mass.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui attempted to catalyze the energy by shocking it with the qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Bang!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He found it unexpectedly easy to spread it apart. Qing Shui felt a wave of boundless energy rising from his dantian. The Demonic Diamond Boar in front of him was shining in gold. Its entire body appeared to be more metallic, looking extremely dazzling in gold.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui jaw dropped instantly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This is because he had once again gained the same amount of defense that he had before, as well as 350,000 worth of enormous strength. On top of that, his speed had also been increased by about 50%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared blankly at the Demonic Diamond Boar in front of him. This fellow who had just reached the Martial King beginner level was able to resist a force of 12 million jin.... That was the opposing force of more than a country. Its body strength had also increased by a whooping 7.5 million jin, even its speed was no longer slower than his…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have picked up a treasure!” This was the thought that crossed Qing Shui’s mind while he was looking at this Demonic Diamond Boar. He had never expected to gain an increase in strength every time it broke through. It was 10% of the strength that the Demonic Diamond Boar had gained.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This had come as an extremely accidental surprise to him. He thought that he would only be getting the 10% of strength from the first time he tamed the Demonic Diamond Boar with the Divine Marionette. This was really unexpected. It seemed like surprises always came at the most unexpected times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui simply couldn’t sit still. This was too powerful. He couldn’t imagine how it would be when this Demonic Diamond Boar reached the peak of Martial King grade…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He rested for awhile!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After taking a few sips of the All Aspect Nourishment Soup, Qing Shui turned his attention to that Flame Phoenix Pellet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, in another room, Canghai Mingyue was looking at Huoyun Liu-Li, the latter of whom had been pouting. She couldn’t help but ask, “What’s wrong Liu-Li? Didn’t you say that you wanted to ask for a present from Qing Shui? Why have you been pouting ever since you returned? Did he bully you?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That big bastard is too mean. I’m so angry!” The more Huoyun Liu-Li thought about it, the angrier she became.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong?” Canghai Mingyue asked with curiosity. It was rare to see Huoyun Liu-Li wearing this kind of facial expression for an extended period of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come with me to look at something, then you’ll understand. I’ll make him pay tomorrow.” Huoyun Liu-Li pulled Canghai Mingyue outside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, it’s late already……”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What are you afraid of? It’s not like that big bastard is going to eat us.” Huoyun Liu-Li huffed angrily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wait, let me get dressed.” Canghai Mingyue quickly said when she saw that Huoyun Liu-Li was about to pull her again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why bother? Big sister will be taken advantage of by that big bastard sooner or later anyway.” Huoyun Liu-Li who had been pouting was now laughing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What? How shameless!” Canghai Mingyue reprimanded Huoyun Liu-Li with a glare.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe. Your face is red, big sister. You turned red whenever I talk about that big bastard. Seems like you’ll really be eaten by that big bastard very soon.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled like a fox, her slyness indescribably attractive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I think you’re the one who wants that. People normally make fun of others in spite their actual innermost desires. Am I right, Liu-Li?” Canghai Mingyue asked Liu-Li with a smile after having finished dressing up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No way!” Huoyun Liu-Li looked a little embarrassed for once.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go. Are you going to get dressed? You’re going there in your sleepwear?” The slightest trace of a faint smile could be seen in Canghai Mingyue’s pitch black eyes. They were very attractive, and it was a shame that no man was lucky enough to admire them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yep, it’s not like he dares to eat me up.” Huoyun Liu-Li replied with a pout.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, could it be that you really want him to eat you?” Canghai Mingyue finished her sentence with a laugh and left the room without waiting for Huoyun Liu-Li to finish pouring her emotions out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, I didn’t know that you were actually this mean.” Huoyun Liu-Li quickly chased after her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Their rooms were only a little more than 10 meters away from Qing Shui’s room. They arrived at Qing Shui’s door very soon, but there was a very eye-catching signboard standing there.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The words on there were very big. ‘Dear Miss Liu-Li, currently cultivating. Please do not disturb or else I might end up in a state of qi deviation.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Canghai Mingyue was done reading, she pulled Huoyun Liu-Li and left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, if you want to laugh then laugh. There’s no need to hold it in.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, it seems like Qing Shui is very terrified of you!” Canghai Mingyue chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m so angry! That bastard went as far as to treat me like that, as if I am a female thug……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. It’s not as if our Liu-Li is a female thug. She’s clearly one!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“SISTER!” Huoyun Liu-Li shouted while stomping her foot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Okay, okay I’m done.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was completely oblivious to everything that was happening on the other side his door. He didn’t even know that he had been called a big bastard by a charming lady. Right at this moment, Qing Shui was holding a Flame Phoenix Pellet and was about to ingest it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“An increase of 5% to all strengths.” Qing Shui became excited at the prospect of this attribute. How could he contain himself? 5% strength increase was a very significant amount to the current Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body had currently achieved the enormous strength of approximately 5.35 million jin. A 5% increase would mean 2.68 million jin of enormous strength? So eating this Flame Phoenix Pellet would allow his body to attain a terrifying 8 million jin of enormous strength….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He shook his head. He shouldn’t think about those things first. He should just swallow it and think about it after his strengths had been increased!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He raised his head and the fiery red pellet went down along his throat. A wave of warm air rose. It didn’t have any fragrance or weird smell, just a warm air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not dare to be reckless. The best thing to do was to circulate the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui felt the warm qi within his body getting more intense. Even without circulating the Ancient Strengthening Technique deliberately, it automatically became faster!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He casted away all distractions and gradually felt that intense heat wave dissipating, to be replaced by a wave of cool and refreshing qi in his body. Compared to the previous heat wave, he felt like his body was in heaven.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The refreshing qi slowly dissipated as well, leaving behind a powerful strength in his dantian and meridians. Even by simply feeling it, Qing Shui could tell that his strength had increased by about 50%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">RIght now, Qing Shui’s strength had attained a terrifying 8,000,000 jin of enormous strength. The sudden increase of strength had made Qing Shui extremely excited. He was even a little unsure of how to react from the shock of this great, pleasant surprise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was itching to experience his current powerful strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He put on the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, battle boots, helmet, and bracelet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Big Dipper Sword was in his hands!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He also readied a piece of Godly Force Talisman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Then, one big cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique was slowly circulated!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body’s strength would increase by 40% with his Frenzied Bull’s Strength. The Golden-Ringed Battle Armor would further increase it by another additional 30%! &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An additional 30% of strength to his body. It was a pity that he hadn’t cultivate it to the level in which he could stun his opponent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An additional 50% increase in body’s strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi of the Large Success Stage. 50% increase in body’s strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately slapped that piece of Godly Force Talisman that he had prepared on his body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With the additional power that his armor and weapon provided, he had attained 25.7 million jin of enormous strength. This was the strength of two and a half countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the start, Qing Shui had been feeling the energy in his body gradually become stronger. It was so strong that even his meridians were taut. It was fortunate that Qing Shui’s own body was strong enough, or else this amount of energy was enough to kill him by exploding his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was shocked right now. In just half a day, his strength had suddenly increased from a little more than one “country” to almost two and half “countries”. He wondered how many people will be shocked if this had gotten out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha, my strength could be considered equal to that of a mediocre Martial King peak!” Qing Shui let out a few high spirited shouts within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“All my strength should be on par with those Supreme Elders!” This increase of strength had allowed Qing Shui to feel the strength of Cang Wuya and those Supreme Elders that he was lucky enough to meet from before. He had felt it so deep and unmeasurable in the past, but he now possessed that very same amount of strength.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And they were all about the age of 300 years old!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui currently felt an intense gratitude towards the Old Ancestor. At the same time, he was sighing in amazement at his greatness. The thing that he had randomly taken out actually allowed his strength to increase exponentially.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feeling the strong wave of energy within his body, he had the sudden impulse to battle a Demonic Beast of peak Martial King grade. Alas, it was just a thought…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taichi Fists!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taichi Single Whip!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang bang bang…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Explosive noises consecutively resonated through the air, and it was louder than before by a few times. Afterimages followed behind his Taichi Single Whip. The force that struck out was heaven and earth-shaking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nice!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t restrain himself from shouting to express his current feelings!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom boom boom…....</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sounds of explosions incessantly rang out in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui was wildly performing every offensive cultivation arts in his arsenal without holding back any of his enormous strength. He used his strength to its greatest extent to familiarize himself with it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The effects of the Godly Force Talisman only wore off after 30 minutes, whereupon Qing Shui gradually come to a stop. A sheen of sweat coated his body, but he had never been better before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without realising it, the time to exit the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal arrived!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had prepared a big water vat in the realm for bathing and washing purposes. He would always spend up to an hour soaking in the water vat, and this was the moment when he could relax the most.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Putting on his clothes, Qing Shui exited the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and very quickly fell into a deep slumber after lying down on his bed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he woke up in the morning he went outside to practise his taichi fists!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya came out shortly after. His eyes instantly lit up as soon as he saw Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He looked at Qing Shui for a short while without asking anything, but the smile on his face turned broader. Cang Wuya was also practising the same Taichi Fist Technique, the very same one that was taught by Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t say anything because he thought that Cang Wuya was doing great with the Taichi Fist Technique, so he let him practice by himself. This fist technique had piqued the Old Man’s interest, therefore he had been practising it diligently. To date, Cang Wuya Taichi’s technique was already of the Ancestor realm. He could also felt the tremendous benefits it had brought to him, which was why he had been practicing it every morning.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realised that Huoyun Liu-Li had been very quiet during breakfast. She would always tease him or force him into bickering with her. But now, she had been quiet and didn’t even glance at him. Qing Shui could sense that she was sending a message to him with such an attitude.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was furious!</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 455 - The Sudden Increase of Strength, The Strength of Two and Half Countries, Ecstasy</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Divine Feet Clearing, Great Perfection Stage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Chengshan, Feiyang, Weiyang, Yinggu, Taixi, Dazhong, Huantiao, Fengshi, Zhongdu, Yangjiao, Guangming, Xuanzhong, Qiuxu, Ququan and Ligou: these 15 acupoints on both of his legs were immediately emitting powerful energy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui felt his bones and meridians being immensely reinforced. The Taixi acupoint strengthened the lower back and invigorated the bones. The Huantiao acupoint reinforced the meridians and increased its flexibility.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The energy exuding from his legs right now made him wanted to jump around wildly. Both his strength and speed had gained a tremendous increase.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Before, the Divine Feet Clearing of Great Perfection Stage could increase 300,000 jin of strength. However, it seemed to be no less than 500,000 jin now, which made Qing Shui extremely happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had been 4.5 million jin of enormous strength before. With this additional 500,000 jin of strength, Qing Shui’s body strength was now an enormous 5 million jin of strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was feeling the additional strength within his body and felt extremely satisfied in his heart. Qing Shui had been restless ever since he had found out about the disparities between him and a peak Martial King grade from the Old Ancestor. Because of this, his yearning towards strength burned even more intensely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s figure could be seen trampling on the same inch of land beneath his feet in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. It was so fast that both of his legs had become a blur. He didn’t stop until half an hour later.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He smiled in satisfaction. “The speed has indeed increased by quite a lot. At least 10% or more!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui raised his qi aura!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Essence!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By now, his body had already achieved an enormous strength of about 5,000,000 jin. This stomp would have the strength of about two and a half countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bam!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A gigantic noise rang out. Even though he was in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, a deep ditch of about 5 metres long was created. Luckily, this was an empty field and the ground on top of it was very quickly restored back to its original state.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Humphh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Fire Bird and the Demonic Diamond Boar let out a loud cry at the gigantic noise, as if trying to respond. The Demonic Diamond Boar, big as a bull by now, quickly rushed over and affectionately circled around Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt extremely happy looking at his darling pet. It almost didn’t look like a boar at all now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elephant?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had never really paid close attention to it before, but now, he suddenly realised that it looked similar to a little golden elephant. The only difference was its trunk which was a little shorter and its ears which were slightly smaller.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He shook his head. Without those characteristics he previously mentioned, it still resembled a boar more than an elephant. If it could evolve once more in the future and become a massive golden boar, it would be very powerful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui imagined a sparkly golden massive boar which was about five or six meters long with the height of two or three meters and a body sturdy like steel. It would possess extraordinary strength. He was sure that it would be able to create caves in a mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He reached over to pat on his Demonic Diamond Boar. Fortunately, Qing Shui had telepathically told it the things it could and could not touch. Otherwise, it would have demolished all medical herbs here as if they were cabbages…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He suddenly recalled that he had reaped quite a lot of benefits when he had tamed this Demonic Diamond Boar with the Divine Marionette. He had gained an ten percent increase of all its strengths.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immersed his mind on his dantian and discovered that there was a lump of “golden” energy somewhere there that had yet to be dispersed. It was as if they were clumping together, which made Qing Shui extremely puzzled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could this be the energy bestowed to him by the Demonic Diamond Boar after it broke through?” Qing Shui mulled over it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I should try to dissolve it and see if I can maybe gain a large amount of energy!” He could feel some energy contained within that golden air mass.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui attempted to catalyze the energy by shocking it with the qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Bang!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He found it unexpectedly easy to spread it apart. Qing Shui felt a wave of boundless energy rising from his dantian. The Demonic Diamond Boar in front of him was shining in gold. Its entire body appeared to be more metallic, looking extremely dazzling in gold.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui jaw dropped instantly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This is because he had once again gained the same amount of defense that he had before, as well as 350,000 worth of enormous strength. On top of that, his speed had also been increased by about 50%.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared blankly at the Demonic Diamond Boar in front of him. This fellow who had just reached the Martial King beginner level was able to resist a force of 12 million jin.... That was the opposing force of more than a country. Its body strength had also increased by a whooping 7.5 million jin, even its speed was no longer slower than his…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have picked up a treasure!” This was the thought that crossed Qing Shui’s mind while he was looking at this Demonic Diamond Boar. He had never expected to gain an increase in strength every time it broke through. It was 10% of the strength that the Demonic Diamond Boar had gained.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This had come as an extremely accidental surprise to him. He thought that he would only be getting the 10% of strength from the first time he tamed the Demonic Diamond Boar with the Divine Marionette. This was really unexpected. It seemed like surprises always came at the most unexpected times.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui simply couldn’t sit still. This was too powerful. He couldn’t imagine how it would be when this Demonic Diamond Boar reached the peak of Martial King grade…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He rested for awhile!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After taking a few sips of the All Aspect Nourishment Soup, Qing Shui turned his attention to that Flame Phoenix Pellet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, in another room, Canghai Mingyue was looking at Huoyun Liu-Li, the latter of whom had been pouting. She couldn’t help but ask, “What’s wrong Liu-Li? Didn’t you say that you wanted to ask for a present from Qing Shui? Why have you been pouting ever since you returned? Did he bully you?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That big bastard is too mean. I’m so angry!” The more Huoyun Liu-Li thought about it, the angrier she became.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong?” Canghai Mingyue asked with curiosity. It was rare to see Huoyun Liu-Li wearing this kind of facial expression for an extended period of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come with me to look at something, then you’ll understand. I’ll make him pay tomorrow.” Huoyun Liu-Li pulled Canghai Mingyue outside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, it’s late already……”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What are you afraid of? It’s not like that big bastard is going to eat us.” Huoyun Liu-Li huffed angrily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wait, let me get dressed.” Canghai Mingyue quickly said when she saw that Huoyun Liu-Li was about to pull her again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why bother? Big sister will be taken advantage of by that big bastard sooner or later anyway.” Huoyun Liu-Li who had been pouting was now laughing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What? How shameless!” Canghai Mingyue reprimanded Huoyun Liu-Li with a glare.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe. Your face is red, big sister. You turned red whenever I talk about that big bastard. Seems like you’ll really be eaten by that big bastard very soon.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled like a fox, her slyness indescribably attractive.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I think you’re the one who wants that. People normally make fun of others in spite their actual innermost desires. Am I right, Liu-Li?” Canghai Mingyue asked Liu-Li with a smile after having finished dressing up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No way!” Huoyun Liu-Li looked a little embarrassed for once.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go. Are you going to get dressed? You’re going there in your sleepwear?” The slightest trace of a faint smile could be seen in Canghai Mingyue’s pitch black eyes. They were very attractive, and it was a shame that no man was lucky enough to admire them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yep, it’s not like he dares to eat me up.” Huoyun Liu-Li replied with a pout.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, could it be that you really want him to eat you?” Canghai Mingyue finished her sentence with a laugh and left the room without waiting for Huoyun Liu-Li to finish pouring her emotions out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, I didn’t know that you were actually this mean.” Huoyun Liu-Li quickly chased after her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Their rooms were only a little more than 10 meters away from Qing Shui’s room. They arrived at Qing Shui’s door very soon, but there was a very eye-catching signboard standing there.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The words on there were very big. ‘Dear Miss Liu-Li, currently cultivating. Please do not disturb or else I might end up in a state of qi deviation.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Canghai Mingyue was done reading, she pulled Huoyun Liu-Li and left.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, if you want to laugh then laugh. There’s no need to hold it in.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, it seems like Qing Shui is very terrified of you!” Canghai Mingyue chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m so angry! That bastard went as far as to treat me like that, as if I am a female thug……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. It’s not as if our Liu-Li is a female thug. She’s clearly one!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“SISTER!” Huoyun Liu-Li shouted while stomping her foot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Okay, okay I’m done.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was completely oblivious to everything that was happening on the other side his door. He didn’t even know that he had been called a big bastard by a charming lady. Right at this moment, Qing Shui was holding a Flame Phoenix Pellet and was about to ingest it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“An increase of 5% to all strengths.” Qing Shui became excited at the prospect of this attribute. How could he contain himself? 5% strength increase was a very significant amount to the current Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His body had currently achieved the enormous strength of approximately 5.35 million jin. A 5% increase would mean 2.68 million jin of enormous strength? So eating this Flame Phoenix Pellet would allow his body to attain a terrifying 8 million jin of enormous strength….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He shook his head. He shouldn’t think about those things first. He should just swallow it and think about it after his strengths had been increased!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He raised his head and the fiery red pellet went down along his throat. A wave of warm air rose. It didn’t have any fragrance or weird smell, just a warm air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not dare to be reckless. The best thing to do was to circulate the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui felt the warm qi within his body getting more intense. Even without circulating the Ancient Strengthening Technique deliberately, it automatically became faster!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He casted away all distractions and gradually felt that intense heat wave dissipating, to be replaced by a wave of cool and refreshing qi in his body. Compared to the previous heat wave, he felt like his body was in heaven.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The refreshing qi slowly dissipated as well, leaving behind a powerful strength in his dantian and meridians. Even by simply feeling it, Qing Shui could tell that his strength had increased by about 50%.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">RIght now, Qing Shui’s strength had attained a terrifying 8,000,000 jin of enormous strength. The sudden increase of strength had made Qing Shui extremely excited. He was even a little unsure of how to react from the shock of this great, pleasant surprise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was itching to experience his current powerful strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He put on the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, battle boots, helmet, and bracelet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Big Dipper Sword was in his hands!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He also readied a piece of Godly Force Talisman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Then, one big cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique was slowly circulated!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His body’s strength would increase by 40% with his Frenzied Bull’s Strength. The Golden-Ringed Battle Armor would further increase it by another additional 30%! &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An additional 30% of strength to his body. It was a pity that he hadn’t cultivate it to the level in which he could stun his opponent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An additional 50% increase in body’s strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi of the Large Success Stage. 50% increase in body’s strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately slapped that piece of Godly Force Talisman that he had prepared on his body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With the additional power that his armor and weapon provided, he had attained 25.7 million jin of enormous strength. This was the strength of two and a half countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the start, Qing Shui had been feeling the energy in his body gradually become stronger. It was so strong that even his meridians were taut. It was fortunate that Qing Shui’s own body was strong enough, or else this amount of energy was enough to kill him by exploding his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was shocked right now. In just half a day, his strength had suddenly increased from a little more than one “country” to almost two and half “countries”. He wondered how many people will be shocked if this had gotten out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha, my strength could be considered equal to that of a mediocre Martial King peak!” Qing Shui let out a few high spirited shouts within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“All my strength should be on par with those Supreme Elders!” This increase of strength had allowed Qing Shui to feel the strength of Cang Wuya and those Supreme Elders that he was lucky enough to meet from before. He had felt it so deep and unmeasurable in the past, but he now possessed that very same amount of strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And they were all about the age of 300 years old!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui currently felt an intense gratitude towards the Old Ancestor. At the same time, he was sighing in amazement at his greatness. The thing that he had randomly taken out actually allowed his strength to increase exponentially.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feeling the strong wave of energy within his body, he had the sudden impulse to battle a Demonic Beast of peak Martial King grade. Alas, it was just a thought…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Taichi Fists!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Taichi Single Whip!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang bang bang…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Explosive noises consecutively resonated through the air, and it was louder than before by a few times. Afterimages followed behind his Taichi Single Whip. The force that struck out was heaven and earth-shaking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Nice!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t restrain himself from shouting to express his current feelings!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom boom boom…....</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sounds of explosions incessantly rang out in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui was wildly performing every offensive cultivation arts in his arsenal without holding back any of his enormous strength. He used his strength to its greatest extent to familiarize himself with it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The effects of the Godly Force Talisman only wore off after 30 minutes, whereupon Qing Shui gradually come to a stop. A sheen of sweat coated his body, but he had never been better before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without realising it, the time to exit the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal arrived!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had prepared a big water vat in the realm for bathing and washing purposes. He would always spend up to an hour soaking in the water vat, and this was the moment when he could relax the most.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Putting on his clothes, Qing Shui exited the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and very quickly fell into a deep slumber after lying down on his bed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he woke up in the morning he went outside to practise his taichi fists!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya came out shortly after. His eyes instantly lit up as soon as he saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He looked at Qing Shui for a short while without asking anything, but the smile on his face turned broader. Cang Wuya was also practising the same Taichi Fist Technique, the very same one that was taught by Qing Shui.</p>

But now, she had been quiet and didn’t even glance at him. Qing Shui could sense that she was sending a message to him with such an attitude.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was furious!</p>
