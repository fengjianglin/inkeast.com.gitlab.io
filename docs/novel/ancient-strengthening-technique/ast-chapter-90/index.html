  <p><strong>AST 0090 – Immediate charm and gentleness</strong></p>
  <p><span style>An old man once gifted me this, and told me that this is good stuff. After I had eaten two of these, I should pass the remaining to those that are important to me. There’s no additional benefits even if I consume more than two.” Qing Shui exclaimed without blinking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>That unknown old man, was being used relentlessly by Qing Shui as his excuse. Every time he had no other possible explanation, he would start talking about that “powerful” old man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“For me to consume?” Shi Qingzhuang was a little surprised as she asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui resolutely nodded his head in agreement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Am I your most important person?” Shi Qingshuang looked at Qing Shui strangely.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Nope, you are my 2nd most important person.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose, as he passed the agility-enhancing fruits over to her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qingzhuang couldn’t accept it. She stared at Qing Shui curiously, as she murmured in her heart, “This little fellow is a worm filled with lust, but just now he and me…… He didn’t even pause to consider before replying, it seems like the weight of the most important woman in his heart, is extremely heavy indeed.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Who’s the most important in your heart then? Why don’t you give these Clear Wind Fruits to her?!” Women, no matter how logical they were, would also have times where they were emotional. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“The most important person in my heart is my mother Qing Yi. I have already saved two for her. If there were only two of these fruits left, then I would only save them for her.” Qing Shui apologetically replied, as he seriously stared into Shi Qingzhuang’s eyes. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, I don’t blame you. In fact, I admire those who are filial. No matter how evil or how tyrannical a person is, as long as there’s filial piety in his heart, then he is still human. In my eyes, no matter how much he has sinned, as long as he is filial, all can be forgiven.” Shi Qingzhuang sincerely added.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are so beautiful when you smile, why don’t you smile more often?” Shi Qingzhuang’s smile fully displayed her splendor, so beautiful that it caused people to be numb. Only after a long while did Qing Shui finally regain his senses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qingzhuang was stunned as she glanced at Qing Shui from the corner of her eyes, “Smooth talking, I once thought you were a gentleman, but you are a beast instead.” Her tone held no traces of malice, but only helplessness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m still better than a beast. Anyway, I was helpless too… you know what your situation was that day, I wanted to be more gentle… but you…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You… this little rotten egg, stop talking…” Shi Qingzhuang shyly interjected, while her face was as red as the setting sun.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui laughed. To be able to melt the ice-princess to such an extent could be considered an extension of his capabilities. Also, knowing that she was his first woman, filled him with pride.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are these really for me?” Shi Qingzhuang reclined herself on the pillow as she asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course! Didn’t I say that you are the most important person in my life aside from my mother?” Qing Shui passed her the fruits.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sweettalker! Anyway you already claimed all the big advantages from me.” After which, Shi Qingzhuang accepted the fruits.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“But… it was also my first time!” Qing Shui exclaimed in a low voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Go to hell!” Shi Qingzhuang replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After eating the agility-enhancing fruits, Qing Shui discovered another effect of it. It was able to heal injuries as well. After his body was clawed by Shi Qingzhuang who was in the throes of passion, Qing Shui decided to consume another to aid in the healing of injuries on his body. But who knew that Shi Qingzhuang recognized the fruit.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t tell anyone regarding the truth of these Clear Wind Fruits!” Qing Shui smiled as he reminded Shi Qingzhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“En, of course, I don’t want to bring trouble upon myself.” </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Can I still look for you in the future?” Qing Shui lowered his head, waiting for Shi Qingzhuang’s reply. It would not be strange if she hated him forever.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qingzhuang glanced at him complicatedly, before shaking her head, “May be there’s no fate between us. Qing Shui, just let nature takes it’s course. Don’t ask me why, you will understand it in the future.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The words of Shi Qingzhuang was within his expectations. Despite this, Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel downcasted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the crestfallen expression of Qing Shui, Shi Qingzhuang unexpectedly added, “However, in the future I want to drink this soup you make every week. No wait, I want to drink it every three days instead.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled wryly as he looked at the serious Shi Qingzhuang. Women were unpredictable indeed!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let’s leave. What about Situ Bufan though? That scum, why don’t you annul the marriage engagement?” Qing Shui asked while walking out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There are many things beyond my control. Sometimes, humans don’t only live for themselves. Even if they knew that there was a fire pit in front of them, they would still jump in with no hesitation.” Shi Qingzhuang replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The words of Shi Qingzhuang struck a chord in Qing Shui’s heart. He had long guessed that the marriage engagement was out of her control. In that instant, many thoughts flashed past his mind, but the most important thing was that he couldn’t aid her in any of these! Because, Qing Shui knew that despite all, she still willing to do the things she didn’t want to do.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui really wanted to ask her why that was the case, but this was not the right time. If she wanted to talk about it, then she would have told him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Once again, the two of them mounted the emberlion steed. Only this time, the feeling was vastly different. When they were riding towards the manor, Shi Qingzhuang was in a semi-conscious state. However, now that they were returning, both of them were clear-headed, which gave rise to a slight feel of romance in the air.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Especially when Qing Shui was hugging the waist of Shi Qingzhuang, his loins thrusted against the full and perky butt of Shi Qingzhuang, and getting erect because of the stimulation. The awkwardness of the situation made Qing Shui felt extremely thrilled, as Shi Qingzhuang became speechless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I can’t control it. If I don’t have the slightest bit of reaction when I’m grinding against the world’s most beautiful lady, I might as well go and die. It’s only normal, why don’t we both take a step back and endure it. We should reach the city very quickly.” Qing Shui randomly sprouted nonsense again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Your warped logic is killing me! You are blatantly taking advantage of me!” Shi Qingzhuang exclaimed as her body arched slightly. </span></p>
  <p><span style>That arch of hers, caused her perky butt to slightly incline in the air. In that instant, Qing Shui shifted his position, and that hard rod of his angled towards her, pressing against her pussy. Even though they were both clothed, both of them still let out a moan. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The body of Shi Qingzhuang became soft as she relinquished control, while Qing Shui pressed in even further. Along with the movements of the emberlion steed, with Qing Shui’s hard rod constantly grinding against her… although it was not as satisfying as sex, it was still extremely stimulating.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Because this time round, Shi Qingzhuang was clear-headed!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the shy smile on her face, Qing Shui enjoyed this feeling immensely. He felt Shi Qingzhuang’s body slightly shudder, as a moist and warm sensation wrapped around him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qingzhuang had already abandoned all concern, and guided Qing Shui’s hard rod inside her, as she climbed atop the mountain of happiness.</span></p>
