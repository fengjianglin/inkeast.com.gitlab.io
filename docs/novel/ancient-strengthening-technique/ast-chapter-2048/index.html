 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Miss, there’s something I want to confess."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui calmly and then said, "What do you want to confess?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, "I just want to say that you're a very beautiful woman."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need to tell me this. I know that." Shen Huang cast a chiding glare at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That glance was very charming, a charm that belonged only to Shen Huang. Qing Shui calmed himself down. He had realized that it was very easy for him to make a fool of himself before Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're quite confident. That's very good. Oh, right. How are things in the Dancing Phoenix Continent?" Qing Shui brewed a pot of tea and poured a cup for Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything’s the same even after I’ve left on my own accord.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you have something to do here? Or are you here to fight to obtain the world?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you think of me as a very ambitious person?" Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui in respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded seriously. "You're a goddess, a queen. There should be many people who think that you're very ambitious and should stand at the top."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There are some things that I don't have a choice in. Are you very ambitious yourself?" Shen Huang asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't know about now, but I definitely wasn't ambitious in the past. I would even be satisfied, being able to live to an old age with a woman I like in a village in the mountains. I wanted to marry a beautiful woman, and beautiful women were pursued after by many people. Therefore, I have to fight to get them and to do so, I have to defeat others. Unknowingly, things have become what they are today." Qing Shui replied very seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I believe that you're a rascal." Shen Huang said, seeming to be both angry and amused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Miss, I've always been curious about something." Qing Shui gave Shen Huang a serious look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What is it?" Shen Huang seemed to know what Qing Shui wanted to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you have a man that you like? Don't be angry. I just wanted to see if the man Young Miss likes is a person with two heads and a tail." Qing Shui noticed that Shen Huang seemed to be on the verge of getting angry and quickly finished his sentences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You only know how to spout rubbish. Are you asking for a beating?" Shen Huang lowered her head and sipped on the tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quietly looked at the woman as a strange feeling clouded their surroundings. It felt as if he was looking at the most beautiful scenery in the world. It was a gaze without any selfish motives and he merely admired quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was filled with emotions about how amazing the creator of all living things was to have created such a beautiful woman in this world. If he hadn't seen her for himself, he would never have believed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang felt a little uneasy by his gaze. She lifted her head to look at Qing Shui, "Haven’t you seen enough?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If you're turned into a very ugly woman, would you feel sad?" Qing Shui asked something that was on his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was surprised by his sudden question for a moment, "Why do you ask that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I feel that you'll forever find it hard to give yourself to a man. It seems a little extravagant to be saying this, but I want to know if you don't wish to look for a man, would you mind if you were to become an ugly woman?" Qing Shui continued to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"To be honest, I'm unwilling to become an ugly woman, but if I were to suddenly become ugly, I probably won't be too upset." Shen Huang gave Qing Shui her honest opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Miss, how long will you be staying in the Northern Blue Domain?" Qing Shui no longer harped on the question. This woman wasn't someone who'd change from just a few words. It should be very hard for her to change the way she thinks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't know. It'll probably be very long because someone of my ability can still make it around here, but I won't be able to do well if I were to probe deeper. The Northern Blue Domain is considered the area with the weakest influences in this world." Shen Huang seemed a little helpless when she said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea what this woman wanted to do. She seemed increasingly mysterious in this world and what he knew of her were just the superficial things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It seems that we really have an affinity. I think I'll also be staying in the Northern Blue Domain for a long while. When I see you, I felt that I've returned to my own hometown." Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's been a while since we've met. I realized that you've turned bad." Shen Huang said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If I was bad, then you'd have long become my woman." Qing Shui gave it some thought before replying seriously. In fact, he hadn't finished what he wanted to say. He wanted to know, if he had used the manliest method to save her back then, would she disappear from this world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang hadn't expected that Qing Shui would say this. Of course, she remembered that day. She didn't say anything but simply lowered her head slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don't be angry. I'll be honest. I just want you to be happier. I know that girls' emotions will fluctuate more when they hear things that are more stimulating...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm not blaming you. I have actually always been treating you as my best friend, the most important friend. Whenever I think of you, I feel that there's still some light in this world." Shen Huang appeared as if nothing had happened and she looked at Qing Shui, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her beautiful smile made Qing Shui stunned for a moment before he smiled awkwardly, "Young Miss, I'm truly overwhelmed and lost for words."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, I'm leaving. I'll come again soon." Shen Huang stood up, said this and then turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sent her to the door, not saying anything. She continued to walk away until she was out of Qing Shui's vision without looking back at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui still had a feeling of a loss. However, this wasn't because he wanted her, but he just didn't have any hope. It was a feeling of helplessness and being neglected. That was the worst feeling of them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Qing Shui knew that he still had a spot in her heart. What she had said earlier on should have been the truth. This woman won't lie. She would only choose between saying it directly or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What a beautiful lady she was!" Yu Xixuan's voice rang out as she walked up to Qing Shui, grinning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"She is undoubtedly beautiful." Qing Shui smiled and looked back at Yu Xixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan was also an extremely beautiful lady, but Qing Shui felt that Yu Xixuan's beauty was more approachable while Shen Huang's and Tantai Lingyan's beauty were ones which would keep others away by giving them an extremely great pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is she your wife?" Yu Xixuan asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Didn't you see that she didn't even turn back to look at me when she left?" Qing Shui shook his head and said with a slight hint of sadness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You sound so peevish!" Yu Xixuan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, let's not talk about that anymore. She's just a friend and heard that an Imperial Cuisine Hall has been set up here and she came to see if it was me. That's why she came here." Qing Shui turned and wanted to head back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan followed Qing Shui in and said, "Have you fallen for her?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lass, do you know what love is? What do you mean by fallen for her?" Qing Shui teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You rascal Qing Shui. Don't get conceited just because I've called you Brother Shui a few times. Of course I know what love is." Yu Xixuan said angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt cheerful when he saw this mature and proud woman's cute side. He then continued, "Then tell me. What is love? Don't say things that others have told you. If you're that capable, then explain with your own experiences."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Erm, I'll just say what love feels like, but you aren't allowed to laugh at me." Yu Xixuan suddenly appeared awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Go on. I won't laugh." Qing Shui also wanted to know what this woman's viewpoint of love was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Loving a person is to feel happy when you see him, talk to him, to know that he would come and look for you. You'll like to see him happy and feel blessed, and you would like to look over him silently. There would be many times when just seeing him will make you very happy, and you'll feel glad or worried because of one thing he says..."</span></p>
