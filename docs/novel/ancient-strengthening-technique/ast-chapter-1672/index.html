 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Give me a chance? Talking so shamelessly. Refusing to take the path leading to heaven, insisting on barging through the gates of hell... Come on, let me see what kind of abilities you have." The old man spoke with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was much stronger than Yin Sha. The Divine Moon Immortal Sect was considered one of the weaker sects amongst the other Immortal Sects. Previously, it was only with the Hong Clan and the other clans that the Divine Moon Immortal Sect could be supported.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blade Demon Immortal Sect was also a sect like this. It was about the same level as the Divine Moon Immortal Sect, but to think that the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect was backing it up. The Demonic Saber Immortal Sect was an existence that was one notch higher as compared to the Divine Moon Immortal Sect and the Blade Demon Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn't stand this old man and when Yin Sha charged over, Qing Shui didn't stop him either and only helped him to increase his cultivation to its peak. Even if Yin Sha wasn't a match for the opponent, the difference wouldn't be huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The increment to his strength gave Yin Sha a boost in confidence. HE even had the confidence to kill this old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man waved his hand and condensed a sword. This weapon had been condensed using his blood essence and it wasn't just an ordinary weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man swung the sword toward Yin Sha and the snow-white cresent blade came slashing down. There was no sound in the air, but this sword attack had sliced through the air, creating gray holesthat clearly reflected the sun, moon, and the stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Sha was the sect lord of the Divine Moon Immortal Sect and being young, he had limitless potential. Amongst the younger generation, he was definitely considered to be the cream of the crop with quite a lot of battle experience. He pierced out with his blue longspear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An attack that was like a venomous snake!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time that Qing Shui had seen an attack like this. The longspear was like a raging and vicious venomous snake, being extremely fast, accurate, and vicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man felt a numb feeling in his hands and his arms felt a little uncomfortable as well. However, he soon recovered. This time around, the reason the old man had stepped forth with such great confidence was because he knew his opponent's level. Knowing your enemies will ensure victories in battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the old man was very confident. He had engaged Yin Sha slightly previous and knew how strong he was. However, he couldn't understand how Yin Sha could get so much stronger out of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the old man, Yin Sha retreated more. However, he was given a boost in confidence and his eyes were flashing with determination as he attacked the old man once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood at the side, constantly monitoring the old man's aura. He wanted to grab the change to let Yin Sha kill this old man. Not only would this give the Divine Moon Immortal Sect a great boost in confidence, it would also deal the opponents a blow to a certain degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Loud sounds of clashing weapons rang out in the air and Qing Shui unleashed the Nine Palace Laws. The depletion of the old man's strength was much faster than that of Yin Sha, and this made him felt a little anxious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a life and death battle, once a person feels anxious, there would be problems. Strong experts had great pressure as well. One of them was due to their reputation. Even if they didn't die, the results of them having lost was inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the old man was distracted, Qing Shui applied the Emperor's Qi and the Art of Pursuing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had initially wanted to use his ultimate killing technique to turn the tables around. However, it was a pity that his abilities took a great plunge out of a sudden. Watching as his opponent came attacking with all his powers, the old man could only choose to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when he dodged that he realized the lethal problem. His speed was not even half of what he usually had. When experts sparred, what they needed was just an instant. In this short moment, Yin Sha's lethal blow slashed down on the old man's shoulder, and came out from the other side of his hip bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lethal blow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what Qing Shui had told Yin Sha about previous. The final blow was Yin Sha's ultimate killing attack. Otherwise, it would be very hard for him to achieve instant kill. The final blow must be fast, and of course, the power must be stronger than he usually was as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instant kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man died. Many people found this unbelievable. Even Yin Sha himself couldn't believe it that he had actually succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people here knew a little of Qing Shui's abilities, but they didn't know much of it, especially of how he could weaken the opponent. &nbsp;Yin Clan and Old Wang all knew that Qing Shui had strong abilities in increasing one's power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still quite a number on the opposite side, but the old man who had died was their leader. With their leader killed, they now felt tremendous danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Sha's confidence level was given a great boost. It wasn't just him alone. Even Qingfeng and Mingyue, who were at the side, saw a glimpse of hope. Although the two of them had came back, they had not planned on keeping their lives. Doing so will allow them to have a peace of mind after their deaths. However, what they hoped even more for was for them to be able to return to the Divine Moon Immortal Sect and to be able to survive this ordeal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, they seemed to see some hope. Even if it was just a little, there was still hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui rapidly called out the Hellfire Phoenix and Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider. The two of them were both in their beast form and charged out together with Yin Sha, Qingfeng, and Mingyue, who were all prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They charged out toward their enemies, fighting with a small number to deal with enemies that were several times greater in numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Phantoms Slaughter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hellfire Phoenix used its most powerful Nine Phantoms Slaughter and the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider also raised its aura to the pinnacle, then surrounding the enemies with its Inescapable Net.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hell's Inferno, Underworld Fireball...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poison Silk Entanglement...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the defense abilities of both the Hellfire Phoenix and the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider were extremely terirfying. Therefore, there wasn't a need to worry about them. Qing Shui brough the Dragon Slaying Beast with him as he charged on forth.</span></p>

This attack caused the opposing side to feel extremely dejected, and hopeless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a short moment, Qing Shui's Golden Battle Halberd took away another old man's life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if they were Divinities? Before greater power, their lives were still cheap and could be taken away from them at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A rout is like the collapse of a mountain. In battle, what was important was to have a more impressive aura than your enemies. Regardless if they had more or less people, or even if they were strong. The same rules applied for the Heavenly Dao. Right now, Qing Shui and the others had completely suppressed the enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This result wasn't out of Qing Shui's expectations. After all, his current abilities were much higher than the enemies. It was just that the other side had greater numbers. If he didn't do what he did, he was worried that Yin Sha, Qingfeng, and Mingyue would be in danger. Therefore, he recklessly used the Paragon Strike which he could only use once a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effect was quite good. The Dark Phoenix and Long Zhu`er played a huge role, with the Dragon Slaying Beast being a little weaker. After all, there was a gap in their abilities and even sneak attacks wouldn't be that easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui felt happy about one this. This beast, that was botha mutated beast and a treasure beast, seemed to be impossible to kill. At the very least, he hadn't discovered what the Dragon Slaying Beast was afraid of or what could deal it serious injuries. It was even impossible to deal it any slight injuries and could really be said to be impenetrable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short while, the enemies lost a large number of their people and the numbers on both side were now basically the same. The battle situation was turned around. Qing Shui had played a huge role in this as most of them had died in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Feng Xi stayed on the ground to take care of Old Wang and Yin Tian, thus they didn't make a move. At the beginning, Tantai Lingyan had thought of calling out the old turtle, but she eventually didn't do it. She knew that Qing Shui would be able to handle the situation, but she hadn't expected him to do it so cleanly and precisely.</span></p>
