 <p><strong><strong>AST 652 - Advancing successfully, Receiving help in a difficult time</strong></strong></p>
 <p>It had eaten a Demon Beast Advancing Pellet, after the time it took for a joss stick to burn, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant did not seem to have any changes. If it was successful, it should have already reacted within this period of time. However, there was no reaction.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that it failed. Even though it had the effects of strengthening the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, it only had a 10 percent chance of doing so. Thus, it was normal for it to fail. However, there was still a feeling of disappointment.</p>
 <p>There were six pills in his hand. From the time he started to analyze the recipe to the point where he refined the pill, it had been almost two full days, Qing Shui was worried that he had made a bad investment.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant did not seem to feel anything, it just happily circled around Qing Shui. Its huge body was incomparably nimble, even though its potential was good, its current strength was too low. Thus in the recent battles, all it could do was to occasionally use the Vajra Subdues Demons.</p>
 <p>After waiting for the time another joss stick took to burn, Qing Shui took out another Demon Beast Advancing Pellet and let the Diamond Gigantic Elephant consume it. He then waited patiently again, praying hard for it to work.</p>
 <p>The time it took for a joss stick to burn passed again. Just when Qing Shui was feeling disappointed and was about to feed it another Demon Beast Advancing Pellet, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s body suddenly glowed with a golden light.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt excited. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant was indeed a mutated beast and had a high growth rate. The low chance of the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet working actually succeeded on the second try.</p>
 <p>The twinkling golden light became a huge cocoon, wrapping the Diamond Gigantic Elephant up. Qing Shui stood happily by the side as he watched the changes of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Afer he knew that the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet was successful, Qing Shui felt relief in his heart. Even if the rest of the Demon Beast Advancing Pellets failed, it was still worth it.</p>
 <p>Prrrrttt!</p>
 <p>After a loud trumpeting, the huge golden cocoon shrunk. To Qing Shui’s eyes, it seemed that the body of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had grown larger by a little. Its length was now 22 meters, its whole body was covered in golden skin that looked like metal. It truly lived up to its name. After he felt the strength of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he laughed happily.</p>
 <p>Its body’s strength increased by about 300 countries and its defense was increased by about 500 countries…...</p>
 <p>All its abilities were substantially raised. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant now had an attacking strength of 450 countries and the defense of more than 900 countries.</p>
 <p>Under the effects of the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection, the abilities of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant were raised by multiple folds. Its attack would reach the strength of close to 1000 countries while its defense would reach that of 1900 countries.</p>
 <p>Its speed was also multiplied by several folds. Originally, the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion was already perversely strong. Now, it was enhanced significantly. Furthermore, with the Ferocious Diamond Attack, its attack would raise by another fold. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant could now unleash an attack with the strength of 2000 countries.</p>
 <p>Although after displaying all its enhanced strengths and abilities, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could barely match the strength of a Human Peak Grade Six Martial Saint and was only equal to a Grade Four Martial Saint Demonic Beast. When the Red Jiao was a Grade 8 Martial Saint, it had the strength of more than 5000 countries.</p>
 <p>For Demonic Beasts, the distance between each grade of Martial Saint from Grade One to Five was the strength of 300 countries. It was due to this reason that Demonic Beasts were stronger than human cultivators. After Grade Five Martial Saint, the difference was the strength of 1000 countries, but that was just the starting point. Just like how an Early Grade Six Martial Saint had the strength of 2500 countries, the Peak Grade Six Martial Saint could reach the strength of 3500 countries. An Early Grade Seven Martial Saint had the strength of more than 3500 countries, the Peak Grade Seven Martial Saint could have the strength of 4500 countries. An Early Grade Eight Martial Saint had the strength of 4500 countries, the Peak Grade Eight Martial Saint could reach the strength of 5500 countries. Back then, the Red Jiao was a Peak Grade Eight Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>Considering the attack of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, it was difficult for it to take part in battles, but with its speed and defense, it would barely be able to do so.</p>
 <p>Looking at the four remaining Demon Beast Advancing Pellets in his hand, Qing Shui prayed in his heart, one pill, just one pill out of the remaining four to succeed…… There was a strong belief in his heart, that it was for the best if he was successful in using them to strengthen the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>This was a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast that was born to battle, it had perversely strong defensive skills, instantaneous killing techniques, tyrannical weakening abilites, and the single target ‘Diamond Sword Qi’ killing technique.</p>
 <p>After breaking through, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant seemed to be more intelligent as it happily pranced around Qing Shui. Qing Shui was naturally happy as well. He stretched out his hands and fed another Demon Beast Advancing Pellet into its mouth.</p>
 <p>What followed was another slow and passive wait that was filled with anticipation, It was a pity that after the time it took to burn two joss sticks, it did not break through. Qing Shui did not hesitate to feed it another pill.</p>
 <p>After the time it took to burn one joss stick, there were no changes, and similarly after the time to burn two joss sticks. Qing Shui kept waiting till the time it took to burn three joss sticks but there were still no signs of breaking through.</p>
 <p>There were still two pills. Qing Shui peacefully fed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant another pill. It was a pity that this pill failed again, but the success rate of 10 percent was just too low.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then casually fed it the last pill. This time, Qing Shui did not bear any hope, he just wanted to feed it the last pill and complete the task. He thought that he was already pretty lucky to have succeeded once.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui planned to use the crystal produced by the Crystal Lion to enhance the effects of the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet. However, it was useless to increase the effects of this pill. The amount of strength the Demon Beast Advancing Pellet can increase was related to the Grade and growth of the Demonic Beast, thus increasing the effects of the pill would not make a difference.</p>
 <p>After the time it took for two joss sticks to burn, there were still no changes. Qing Shui felt that this pill must have failed as well. Qing Shui massaged his head. At least one pill succeeded. He would then take some time to refine the 20% in strength he obtained from the growth of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, as it was already considered a significant increase to him.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was about to turn away, a familiar golden light suddenly appeared!</p>
 <p>Successful advancement?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned his head back to view the familiar scene, his whole body trembling in excitement. As long as the Diamond Gigantic Elephant advanced again, he would not have to worry about it being insta-killed. This way he could use the Vajra Subdues Demons as he wished without worrying.</p>
 <p>In the past, he had to worry a lot every time he used the Vajra Subdues Demons, even to the point where sometimes, he did not dare to let the Diamond Gigantic Elephant out, in fear of it being killed in one move.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui stared unblinkingly at the golden cocoon enveloping the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, waiting for that familiar heaven shaking trumpeting sound.</p>
 <p>Prrrrttt!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui ecstatically felt the explosive improvements of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Its body’s strength increased by another 300 countries, its defense increased by 500 countries.</p>
 <p>Under the effects of passive skills like Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection, and Diamond Crossing Rivers, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant reached a terrifying defense of 3000 countries. When using Ferocious Diamond Attack, its attack was the strength of 3000 countries.</p>
 <p>“Haha, this barely reaches the strength of a Human Grade Eight Martial Saint!” Qing Shui could not help but be ecstatic.</p>
 <p>The most important improvement was the perverse speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Its abilities may not be strong, but Qing Shui was confident that with the supplementary techniques, it could execute a terrifying sneak attack. This was because the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion. Therefore, within the defined area, it had a perverse instantaneous attack.</p>
 <p>Currently, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s body was 25 meters long. It looked even more robust and strong, looking incomparably mighty with the metal-like golden beast skin covering its whole body. When riding on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, it allowed one to feel a sense of security.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui truly did not have any hope for the final Demon Beast Advancing Pellet. It had even passed the time it took for two joss sticks to burn, thus he did not expect it to succeed.</p>
 <p>It was truly too surprising because this breakthrough was particularly crucial. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s strength of 300 countries and defense of 500 countries would be increased by several folds under the effects of Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection and its attack further increased by several folds under the effects of Ferocious Diamond Attack……</p>
 <p>Out of the six Demon Beast Advancing Pellets, there were two that succeeded. Qing Shui was very satisfied. It was fortunate that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had a strong growth. Or else, succeeding even once would be considered very fortunate.</p>
 <p>After eating a little, Qing Shui slept. He needed to be well rested because he had to refine the other medicinal pills. Prior to that, he had to refine the 20% strength he obtained when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant broke through.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui slept for 8 hours. It had been a long time since Qing Shui slept for this long.</p>
 <p>Inner Sight!</p>
 <p>He found the familiar gaseous mass. However, this was the largest he had seen. After all, the increase in strength this time was the largest.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant had broken through twice, its body’s strength increased by 600 countries, its defense increased 1000 countries, its speed and the other attributes had multiplied by several folds.</p>
 <p>20% of that!</p>
 <p>“Haha, that's significant, the increase in strength of 120 countries, defense of 200 countries, and a significant increase in speed of more than 50% of my original speed……” Qing Shui felt ecstatic.</p>
 <p>Having such an increase in strength at this crucial juncture made him feel very happy.</p>
 <p>After his rest, Qing Shui adjusted his mental state to its peak and prepared to refine that gaseous mass. He circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique for a cycle before slowly activating the Nature Energy, State of Immovable as Mountains, Frenzied Bull's Strength…… circulating them to their peaks.</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>After the gaseous mass was broken by Qing Shui, a tremendous energy exploded in the inside of Qing Shui, instantly causing Qing Shui to feel an intense pain. It felt like his entire Dantian and meridians were falling apart.</p>
 <p>As the berserk energy circulated his body, Qing Shui continued to look within himself and circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique, slowly absorbing and taming that berserk energy for his own use.</p>
 <p>A full day!</p>
 <p>For an entire day, Qing Shui just sat there without moving, enduring the colliding energy and damage caused by that tyrannical energy.</p>
 <p>When the energy surpassed what the body can withstand, it would cause continuous destruction to the body. However, Qing Shui’s body was sufficiently tough, the toughness and resilience a characteristic of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>After a day passed, Qing Shui slowly opened his eyes. The faint smile on his face showed that he was especially happy. He examined his current strength. His body’s strength had reached the strength of 400 countries and the defense of 600 countries. Under the effects of the passively circulating Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection, he had the strength of 800 countries and defense of 1200 countries.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of others, Qing Shui seemed like a Peak Grade 4 Martial Saint that focused on cultivating the body.</p>
 <p>The strength of 400 countries... Qing Shui could not resist and started circulating the Nature Energy as well as all the other techniques that could raise his strength. He also picked up the Big Dipper Sword and Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>Godly Force Talisman!</p>
 <p>Divine Shield Talisman!</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>He struck out with all his might using the Combination Sword Technique!</p>
