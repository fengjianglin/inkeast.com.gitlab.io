 <p><strong>Chapter 422 Darkgold Three-Headed Python, The Terrifying Mighty Elephant Stomp .</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 422 Darkgold Three-Headed Python, The Terrifying Mighty Elephant Stomp</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The diagram of the Godly Force Talisman was a violent demonic beast which was like a huge raging ape. Its body was inclined to the front, its thick arms slightly raised to the sides, exuding a strength of great wildness and violence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The section below explained how to draw and the main points, and even broke it up into tens of small scaled drawings to explain everything in steps. It also listed out the crucial points and the way to use the Qi of Xiantian.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan had mentioned this previously and Qing Shui had also seen the way he had drawn the Talisman. Therefore, it seemed to feel very easy to him. At least he could see clearly and knew how to draw it, but now it seemed impossible for him to succeed in drawing one himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not attempt to draw one, but just looked at it, trying to remember. Moreover, even if he wanted to attempt it, he did not have the ingredients to do so. While he had quite a lot of demonic beast hide which he obtained from Yan Clan's treasure cove, he did not have demonic beast's blood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were many times when Qing Shui had thought that that pen could be left behind by an Art Maestro. That pen was brimming with spirit and intelligence. Qing Shui had been suppressing not to use it to draw the Talisman. Hei subconsciously felt that it was not suitable and he still needed to wait. Therefore, he got himself a pen from Lin Zhanhan, one made from the tail-hair of a normal 1,000-year demonic beast..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the &lt;&lt;Ancient Records of Heavenly Talisman&gt;&gt; in great detail very slowly. He took a whole 4 hours before moving on to the next Heavenly Talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Divine Shield Talisman！</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt speechless at their names. However, they were just names, so Qing Shui did not dwell too much into them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The diagrams on the Divine Shield Talisman were not unfamiliar to Qing Shui. It was the diagram of a lifelike tortoise shell. The fine detailed patterns on the tortoise shell were very clear. The Divine Shield Talisman &nbsp;was a Heavenly Talisman which increased one's defenses. Of course, it was also allowed for him to use it on his opponents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very quickly, and Qing Shui headed towards Cang Lang Country at great speed. The Firebird would occasionally let out a loud screech, and the demonic beasts in the area would all scramble off in fright.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When it was dark, they just happened to be over a mountain. Qing Shui decided to just stay here for the night and head off the next day. After all, they were not far off from Cang Lang Country.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found a vast space and set up tent there. He also let the Diamond Demonic Boar out. It was long dissatisfied with staying in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once it came out, it started to run and jump about everywhere. Qing Shui was not afraid that it would run off nor was he afraid that it would run into trouble. There were not many people in Cang Lang Country who would be able to kill a Diamond Demonic Boar in an instant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It might be because he had passed by this area a few times that even Qing Shui knew that this place was known as the Jade Dragon Mountain. It was said that long ago a Jade Snake had appeared in this place. The Jade Snake was a demonic beast of at least the Martial Saint level in the world of the nine continents, and it was rumored that the Jade Snake from this area eventually had two horns, four claws, turning into a White Jade Dragon. The place was thus named the Jade Dragon Mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were many snakes of various sizes in the Jade Dragon Mountain. However, a second Jade Snake never appeared again. Qing Shui continued to think about this as he pitched his tent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During this time, the Diamond Demonic Boar had long run off somewhere!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Firebird found a safe spot and rested. After flying at great speed for the day, the energy it had exhausted was quite large. Qing Shui noticed that there was still time and thus prepared to take a look around the vicinity before heading to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had not gotten far when a wild beast's cry rang out. Qing Shui's heart leapt and he anxiously headed towards the direction of the sound. It was because the sound came from the Diamond Demonic Boar.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That cry was one of exceptional terror!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What cultivation level would one have to let the Diamond Demonic Boar cty out in such horror? The Diamond Demonic Boar was an existence which would not lose out to even the most elementary level demonic beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a few breaths’ time, Qing Shui had already rushed there. Even the Firebird was circling above Qing Shui, unceasingly screeching out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui arrived, he saw that the Diamond Demonic Boar was running for its life, jumping about everywhere. When it saw Qing Shui, it ran towards him as fast as it could.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw what was chasing the Diamond Demonic Boar. It was a python which was as thick as two large water vats. Its body was completely dark gold in color, and Qing Shui estimated it to be about hundred meters long.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The python opened its big mouth which could swallow a few people in one go. Its ugly head and the overwhelming stench caused Qing Shui to frown.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He frowned not because of the stench, but because he saw that there were two small snake heads the size of a human head next to the python's huge and ugly head. It looked extremely weird.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Why is there an intermediate Martial King level demonic beast here?" Qing Shui did not understand this. His initial sense was that it was comparable to a grade 8 Martial King cultivator, but amongst the demonic beasts, it was at intermediate Martial King level. It was no wonder that the Diamond Demonic Boar was so terrified earlier. But thankfully, it was intelligent and had dodged about. If not, it would have been devoured.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled that he had came across the drawing of this snake in the Archive of Demonic Beast. This python was known as the "Dark Gold Three-Headed Python"!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The "Jade Dragon Mountain" was surrounded by desolate wilderness and forests up to a thousand li away. There were no cities or countries in the area. In Cang Lang Country, Qing Clan guessed that this fellow was not just the lord over Jade Dragon Mountain, but also the strongest in the area.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at the humongous three-headed python before him, feeling a bit worried. After all, it was a Martial King level demonic beast!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ning!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Firebird let out a high pitch screech in the air!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python glanced at the Firebird warily, and swung the bottom half of its body as if it was a giant whip, whipping out towards the Firebird &nbsp;which was in the air at the speed of lightning.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What great speed!" Qing Shui could not help but want to clap for this whip. It was too strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it was in the past, the Firebird would probably not be able to dodge it, but now it could. After all, the speed now was what the Firebird was best in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Swoosh swoosh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two stones in his hands shot out towards the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's two eyes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ding ding!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python closed its eyes calmly and the two stones immediately turned into dust, scattering in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hiss!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The furious Dark Gold Three-Headed Python swung up its tail and whipped it towards Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Swoosh swoosh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sound of the python's tail cutting across the air rang out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Whip!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It crushed the rocks on the stones into dust, creating a ten meter long, two meter wide crater in the ground where Qing Shui was standing earlier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing that it had not hit Qing Shui, the humongous tail swept out towards him like it was sweeping out an army of a thousand troops!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Rocks were sent about everywhere, and within the distance of a hundred meters, the place was like a sandstorm!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui brought out the strength from all over his body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His fists were already launched out towards the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's body which was swiping out towards him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Pu pu!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His arms pierced through the snake's skin, and the snake's flesh sunk all the way to his shoulders! It was a pity that the snake's body was too big. While his arms had sunk into the snake, to the tremendous Dark Gold Three-Headed Python, it was like a human was pricked by two needles.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hiss!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python let out a loud hiss in pain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Not good!" Qing Shui thought to himself!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But just as he was about to draw out his arms, Qing Shui felt that that he was already tangled up at quick speed, twirled up tightly. Its grip grew increasingly tighter and even lifted him up into mid-air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's strength was of no use at all!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ning!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Firebird suddenly spewed out purple flames towards the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python. It could be because it had just been through a day of fast paced flight, the depletion of its "Core Qi" was very great that the flames seemed to be a lot weaker. But just as the flames were about to fry the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's head, its two small heads concurrently spewed thick white fog.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hisssss!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the Firebird’s purple flames were swallowed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very gloomy. He had a lot of strength with him, but it was as if he was in a swamp and was not able to utilize it. Qing Shui would never have thought that this situation would happen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pfft!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar took the opportunity to clash against the python, and opened its mouth to bite off a large chunk of flesh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hiss!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Whip!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar was sent flying with the whip of its tail, creating a dent into the rock walls nearby, sending stone chunks flying about.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It may be because the Diamond Demonic Boar had completely angered the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python, that it curled up and in the end, was as if it was walking upright, swinging its large boody as it headed towards the boar.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was then when Qing Shui discovered that his feet were stepping on a part of the python's body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The chance had arrived!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been waiting for this chance!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gathered all the force in his body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After taking in a deep breath, Qing Shui gradually lifted up his right foot, and then stomped it down fiercely!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hssss.....</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A huge strength of 19 million jin passed through the snake's body like a shockwave, as if a gorge had been stomped into the ground.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blood and flesh were sent flying!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">About ten meters from where his foot had landed was where the python's heart and gut were located...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The kick which had landed on the python's body was fatal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python fell to the ground in pain, not moving. Its blood which was flowing out dyed the rocks under Qing Shui's feet red.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, isn't this the blood which can be used for Talisman drawing?" Qing Shui quickly looked for the many vats in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal which were used to store wine and filled up twenty of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's enough!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then ripped off the snake skin. The snake's gut, heart and Core had already been smashed by Qing Shui's fatal kick.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After cleaning up, Qing Shui brought the Firebird and the Diamond Demonic Boar back to the tent and then put them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He then entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as well. This way, he would not need to be afraid that they would be in danger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Firebird flew up to that huge Chinese Parasol Tree to rest. One month plus in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was equivalent to six hours outside. That was why Qing Shui dared to let the Firebird fly at its greatest speed for the whole day. After all, he had enough time to let it rest and recover. Moreover, letting the Firebird fly at such extreme speed was also highly beneficial for it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cultivation, forging, alchemy...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could not drop any of them. Now, Qing Shui had one more area to train!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Talisman Drawing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sliced the snake skin into chunks and while channeling Nature Energy, he picked up a dagger he had forged from Tempered Metallic Essence, easily slicing through the snake skin.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then picked up a piece of the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's skin and tempered it. He had read from the earlier chapters in the book of "Heavenly Talisman" that there was a specific method of teaching one how to temper items.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, tempering beast skins and fresh blood was the most basic in Talisman Drawing, and was something that one required to pick up. It was just that it was too plain and exhausted too much Qi of Xiantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already at the "Minute Subtlety" stage, and the sensitivity of his Spiritual Sense was also more agile now. He fully focused his mind and body to control the minute changes to the beast hide's patterns.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's spoilt so easily?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Again!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Again!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know how many failures he had been through. He just completely focused on what he was doing, gathering all his effort as he continued to temper. Multiple failures is the stairway leading to the peaks of success.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not attempt to draw one, but just looked at it, trying to remember. Moreover, even if he wanted to attempt it, he did not have the ingredients to do so. While he had quite a lot of demonic beast hide which he obtained from Yan Clan's treasure cove, he did not have demonic beast's blood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were many times when Qing Shui had thought that that pen could be left behind by an Art Maestro. That pen was brimming with spirit and intelligence. Qing Shui had been suppressing not to use it to draw the Talisman. Hei subconsciously felt that it was not suitable and he still needed to wait. Therefore, he got himself a pen from Lin Zhanhan, one made from the tail-hair of a normal 1,000-year demonic beast..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the &lt;&lt;Ancient Records of Heavenly Talisman&gt;&gt; in great detail very slowly. He took a whole 4 hours before moving on to the next Heavenly Talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Divine Shield Talisman！</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt speechless at their names. However, they were just names, so Qing Shui did not dwell too much into them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The diagrams on the Divine Shield Talisman were not unfamiliar to Qing Shui. It was the diagram of a lifelike tortoise shell. The fine detailed patterns on the tortoise shell were very clear. The Divine Shield Talisman &nbsp;was a Heavenly Talisman which increased one's defenses. Of course, it was also allowed for him to use it on his opponents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very quickly, and Qing Shui headed towards Cang Lang Country at great speed. The Firebird would occasionally let out a loud screech, and the demonic beasts in the area would all scramble off in fright.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When it was dark, they just happened to be over a mountain. Qing Shui decided to just stay here for the night and head off the next day. After all, they were not far off from Cang Lang Country.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found a vast space and set up tent there. He also let the Diamond Demonic Boar out. It was long dissatisfied with staying in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once it came out, it started to run and jump about everywhere. Qing Shui was not afraid that it would run off nor was he afraid that it would run into trouble. There were not many people in Cang Lang Country who would be able to kill a Diamond Demonic Boar in an instant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It might be because he had passed by this area a few times that even Qing Shui knew that this place was known as the Jade Dragon Mountain. It was said that long ago a Jade Snake had appeared in this place. The Jade Snake was a demonic beast of at least the Martial Saint level in the world of the nine continents, and it was rumored that the Jade Snake from this area eventually had two horns, four claws, turning into a White Jade Dragon. The place was thus named the Jade Dragon Mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were many snakes of various sizes in the Jade Dragon Mountain. However, a second Jade Snake never appeared again. Qing Shui continued to think about this as he pitched his tent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During this time, the Diamond Demonic Boar had long run off somewhere!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Firebird found a safe spot and rested. After flying at great speed for the day, the energy it had exhausted was quite large. Qing Shui noticed that there was still time and thus prepared to take a look around the vicinity before heading to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had not gotten far when a wild beast's cry rang out. Qing Shui's heart leapt and he anxiously headed towards the direction of the sound. It was because the sound came from the Diamond Demonic Boar.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That cry was one of exceptional terror!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What cultivation level would one have to let the Diamond Demonic Boar cty out in such horror? The Diamond Demonic Boar was an existence which would not lose out to even the most elementary level demonic beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In a few breaths’ time, Qing Shui had already rushed there. Even the Firebird was circling above Qing Shui, unceasingly screeching out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui arrived, he saw that the Diamond Demonic Boar was running for its life, jumping about everywhere. When it saw Qing Shui, it ran towards him as fast as it could.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw what was chasing the Diamond Demonic Boar. It was a python which was as thick as two large water vats. Its body was completely dark gold in color, and Qing Shui estimated it to be about hundred meters long.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The python opened its big mouth which could swallow a few people in one go. Its ugly head and the overwhelming stench caused Qing Shui to frown.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He frowned not because of the stench, but because he saw that there were two small snake heads the size of a human head next to the python's huge and ugly head. It looked extremely weird.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Why is there an intermediate Martial King level demonic beast here?" Qing Shui did not understand this. His initial sense was that it was comparable to a grade 8 Martial King cultivator, but amongst the demonic beasts, it was at intermediate Martial King level. It was no wonder that the Diamond Demonic Boar was so terrified earlier. But thankfully, it was intelligent and had dodged about. If not, it would have been devoured.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled that he had came across the drawing of this snake in the Archive of Demonic Beast. This python was known as the "Dark Gold Three-Headed Python"!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The "Jade Dragon Mountain" was surrounded by desolate wilderness and forests up to a thousand li away. There were no cities or countries in the area. In Cang Lang Country, Qing Clan guessed that this fellow was not just the lord over Jade Dragon Mountain, but also the strongest in the area.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at the humongous three-headed python before him, feeling a bit worried. After all, it was a Martial King level demonic beast!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ning!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Firebird let out a high pitch screech in the air!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python glanced at the Firebird warily, and swung the bottom half of its body as if it was a giant whip, whipping out towards the Firebird &nbsp;which was in the air at the speed of lightning.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What great speed!" Qing Shui could not help but want to clap for this whip. It was too strong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If it was in the past, the Firebird would probably not be able to dodge it, but now it could. After all, the speed now was what the Firebird was best in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two stones in his hands shot out towards the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's two eyes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ding ding!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python closed its eyes calmly and the two stones immediately turned into dust, scattering in the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hiss!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The furious Dark Gold Three-Headed Python swung up its tail and whipped it towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sound of the python's tail cutting across the air rang out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Whip!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It crushed the rocks on the stones into dust, creating a ten meter long, two meter wide crater in the ground where Qing Shui was standing earlier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing that it had not hit Qing Shui, the humongous tail swept out towards him like it was sweeping out an army of a thousand troops!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Rocks were sent about everywhere, and within the distance of a hundred meters, the place was like a sandstorm!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui brought out the strength from all over his body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His fists were already launched out towards the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's body which was swiping out towards him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Pu pu!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His arms pierced through the snake's skin, and the snake's flesh sunk all the way to his shoulders! It was a pity that the snake's body was too big. While his arms had sunk into the snake, to the tremendous Dark Gold Three-Headed Python, it was like a human was pricked by two needles.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Hiss!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python let out a loud hiss in pain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Not good!" Qing Shui thought to himself!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But just as he was about to draw out his arms, Qing Shui felt that that he was already tangled up at quick speed, twirled up tightly. Its grip grew increasingly tighter and even lifted him up into mid-air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's strength was of no use at all!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ning!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Firebird suddenly spewed out purple flames towards the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python. It could be because it had just been through a day of fast paced flight, the depletion of its "Core Qi" was very great that the flames seemed to be a lot weaker. But just as the flames were about to fry the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's head, its two small heads concurrently spewed thick white fog.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hisssss!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the Firebird’s purple flames were swallowed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt very gloomy. He had a lot of strength with him, but it was as if he was in a swamp and was not able to utilize it. Qing Shui would never have thought that this situation would happen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pfft!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar took the opportunity to clash against the python, and opened its mouth to bite off a large chunk of flesh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hiss!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Whip!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar was sent flying with the whip of its tail, creating a dent into the rock walls nearby, sending stone chunks flying about.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It may be because the Diamond Demonic Boar had completely angered the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python, that it curled up and in the end, was as if it was walking upright, swinging its large boody as it headed towards the boar.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was then when Qing Shui discovered that his feet were stepping on a part of the python's body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The chance had arrived!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been waiting for this chance!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gathered all the force in his body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After taking in a deep breath, Qing Shui gradually lifted up his right foot, and then stomped it down fiercely!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hssss.....</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A huge strength of 19 million jin passed through the snake's body like a shockwave, as if a gorge had been stomped into the ground.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Blood and flesh were sent flying!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">About ten meters from where his foot had landed was where the python's heart and gut were located...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The kick which had landed on the python's body was fatal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Dark Gold Three-Headed Python fell to the ground in pain, not moving. Its blood which was flowing out dyed the rocks under Qing Shui's feet red.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, isn't this the blood which can be used for Talisman drawing?" Qing Shui quickly looked for the many vats in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal which were used to store wine and filled up twenty of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's enough!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then ripped off the snake skin. The snake's gut, heart and Core had already been smashed by Qing Shui's fatal kick.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After cleaning up, Qing Shui brought the Firebird and the Diamond Demonic Boar back to the tent and then put them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He then entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as well. This way, he would not need to be afraid that they would be in danger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Firebird flew up to that huge Chinese Parasol Tree to rest. One month plus in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was equivalent to six hours outside. That was why Qing Shui dared to let the Firebird fly at its greatest speed for the whole day. After all, he had enough time to let it rest and recover. Moreover, letting the Firebird fly at such extreme speed was also highly beneficial for it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cultivation, forging, alchemy...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could not drop any of them. Now, Qing Shui had one more area to train!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Talisman Drawing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sliced the snake skin into chunks and while channeling Nature Energy, he picked up a dagger he had forged from Tempered Metallic Essence, easily slicing through the snake skin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then picked up a piece of the Dark Gold Three-Headed Python's skin and tempered it. He had read from the earlier chapters in the book of "Heavenly Talisman" that there was a specific method of teaching one how to temper items.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, tempering beast skins and fresh blood was the most basic in Talisman Drawing, and was something that one required to pick up. It was just that it was too plain and exhausted too much Qi of Xiantian.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already at the "Minute Subtlety" stage, and the sensitivity of his Spiritual Sense was also more agile now. He fully focused his mind and body to control the minute changes to the beast hide's patterns.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's spoilt so easily?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Again!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Again!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know how many failures he had been through. He just completely focused on what he was doing, gathering all his effort as he continued to temper. Multiple failures is the stairway leading to the peaks of success.</p>
