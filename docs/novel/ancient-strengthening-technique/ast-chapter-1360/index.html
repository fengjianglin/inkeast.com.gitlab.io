 <p><strong>AST 1360 Qing Sha's Physique, Pernicious Devil, Preparing To Refind the Four-Yang Pill</strong></p>
 <p>Di Chen took Qing Shui's hand and they had a stroll on the grassy plains. Looking at the extremely beautiful lady next to him, Qing Shui had an indescribable sense of pride. People said that women are the face of men and could reflect men's taste. He didn't know if this was right but he knew that capable men would have no lack of beautiful ladies next to them.</p>
 <p>The beauty of ladies wasn't referring just to their appearance. If a beautiful lady appeared to be vulgar in their actions and speech and was loose, these would soon cause her beautiful appearance to become not so beautiful. A lady that was like a vase and had nothing good about her except her beauty, wouldn't be able to stand up against time. Some people couldn't even become vases.</p>
 <p>Beautiful ladies required not only beautiful appearances but what was inside counted as well. Ladies who were truly beautiful were like a vat of great wine. The longer the time passed, the greater the fragrance unleashed. This was how it was for one's disposition.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, disposition was more important that one's appearance. Even if some women could only barely be considered beautiful, their dispositions could make them the most beautiful ladies, giving off a feeling that would charm others.</p>
 <p>Disposition wasn't to put on appearances. It was to have graceful actions and every frown and every smile would strike a chord in one's heart. However, these must all be on the basis that everything was as natural as possible. If it was something that was done intentionally, while it might work once or twice, as time passed, the effect would be lost.</p>
 <p>Only natural and appropriate was true beauty.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that all of his women could be said to have both great disposition and appearances. All of them had different dispositions but Qing Shui liked them all. There were no good or bad dispositions. A bad woman's disposition could also work in attracting others or could even make one go even crazier.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, Master planned to let me take over the Lotus Sect after the new year," Di Chen said softly as they walked.</p>
 <p>Di Chen's abilities were considered to be the strongest in the Lotus Sect. Therefore, there were no objections to having her take over the Lotus Sect. Moreover, this was something which had been decided a long time ago.</p>
 <p>"That's good. My Chen`er is going to be the head of a sect very soon." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Di Chen. If she was in his previous life, she would definitely be a career woman and a very successful one to boot.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After staying for a day, Qing Shui bade Di Chen goodbye and headed to the Heaven Secrets Academy. Things seemed to be progressing very well. With the Nine Continents Steps, it was still quite easy for Qing Shui to head to the Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, the initial state of calm between the major influences in the Western Oxhe Continent were all due to Qing Shui. On the surface, all of these powers had some sort of contact with Qing Shui and some had even stronger relations with him.</p>
 <p>The Lotus Sect and Putuo Mountain were existences like sacred land in the Western Oxhe Continent. There were also the Heaven Secrets Academy and Divine Might Dynasty as well. Some major powers had extensive information networks and knew of how strong Qing Shui and other great powers were. Lotus Sect and Putuo Mountain had far surpassed them, so it was better for them to law low.</p>
 <p>Breezing Wind Veranda!</p>
 <p>The moment Qing Shui arrived at the Breezing Wind Veranda, he saw the few ladies practicing with their sword. Eldest Princess was the first to sense Qing Shui and turned to find him smiling as he looked at them.</p>
 <p>She broke into a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui instantly appeared next to them.</p>
 <p>"Father!" Qing Sha didn't wait for Qing Shui or Eldest Princess to say anything before she wrapped her arms around Qing Shui's neck.</p>
 <p>The Seventh Princess and Yan Jinyu were around as well. For the past half a year or so, they had been improving ceaselessly, especially Eldest Princess and Qing Sha. Qing Sha's great progress was due to her terrifying physique and the rate of her improvement was just as if she was cultivating some demonic technique. It was unrivalled. The one flaw in cultivating demonic techniques was that one's foundations wouldn't be strong.</p>
 <p>However, it was different for Qing Sha. That Blood Terminator Bead in her Dantian could exude a mysterious power that could prevent this situation from happening. Also Qing Shui could help her strengthen her foundations and nurture her constitution.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui treated everyone around him the same. As long as it was something they could use, he would not be stingy. Even if he didn't have many of the items, he would openly let them know the situation and let them make the decision.</p>
 <p>All of them were close to his heart and although love was selfish, love would also allow one to embrace everything.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess’ physique had long awakened but Qing Sha had managed to catch up to her even though she had started at a later time. She had now surpassed Eldest Princess by a little.</p>
 <p>"Lass, your improvement is quite fast," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Is it a little too fast?" Qing Sha looked at Qing Shui and said a little worriedly.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry. No matter how fast you're improving, there's no need to worry. Your unique physique will negate the instability that is brought by the improvement that's too fast." Qing Shui was very astonished as well. During this half a year or so, Qing Sha was the one who had changed the most.</p>
 <p>Evil pernicious star... Even Qing Shui didn't know what changes Qing Sha would undergo in the future. He was very worried that at this rate, the moment she stepped into the doors of Heavenly Dao, she would really become a Pernicious Devil.</p>
 <p>The pernicious aura in her body was already fully awakened. It was because of this that her abilities were increasing at such a crazy rate. As long as she reached the Heavenly Dao, the pernicious aura in her body would turn into pernicious devilish aura. It would let her safely and quickly pass through the seemingly impossible barrier and to attain False God.</p>
 <p>As long as Qing Sha were to reach Heavenly Dao, then she'd definitely be able to attain False God realm and within just a short amount of time. Even the barriers to False God wouldn't be able to stand up against the corrosion from the pernicious devilish aura. After breaking through to False God, her greatest advantage would disappear as well. She would only be a little bit faster than ordinary people. However, upon attaining False God, troubles would also come to her. The False God divine tribulation she had to go through would be one-third more terrifying than what others had to go through.</p>
 <p>The one-third increment wasn't something to be underestimated.</p>
 <p>The chances of one getting through the False God divine tribulation was usually around 50 to 70%. Of course, one could rely on the help of items to increase the chances. The further into the divine tribulation, the success rate would get lower. Increasing the difficulty by one-third would truly be very tough.</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui got to know in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. It was hard to say if it was accurate but right now, it seemed pretty true for Qing Sha's condition.</p>
 <p>When the time comes, he might be able to help her if he were to attain a breakthrough to the eighth heavenly layer.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess had the slowest progress relatively. However it was already very fast for them. The two of them put in hard work and effort into their cultivation everyday. The pressure that Qing Sha gave them was far too great. There was no exception to Eldest Princess. It wasn't that they didn't want Qing Sha to get stronger but it was just purely pressure that they were experiencing.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Sha`er's improvement is really too fast."</p>
 <p>That night, when Qing Shui was in Yu Sunu's room, she said worriedly.</p>
 <p>"She has the physique of an evil pernicious star that is hard to come by in 1,000 years. There are both advantages and disadvantages. There won't be any problems in the short term but we'll still need to make the necessary preparations in advance," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>The number of people in the Breezing Wind Veranda had reached 8,000. Number wise, it was considered low but in terms of power, they were the strongest. The younger generation had been thrown way back by Yu Sunu. This time around, Qing Shui wanted to help to increase her power through medicinal pills. After this, it wouldn't take long before it would be hard for there to be anyone in the Heaven Secrets Academy who could stand up against her.</p>
 <p>There was no need to say how powerful the Origin Returning Pill was, to be able to increase 20% or more in power within a year. Including the other effects, it was extremely terrifying.</p>
 <p>Di Chen would be becoming the sect lord of the Lotus Sect. It wouldn't be long before Eldest Princess took over the Heaven Secrets Academy either. As for Yehuang Guwu, she would soon gain enough power to head to the Dancing Phoenix Continent with him. By then, Tantai Xuan would also have taken over Putuo Mountain without any issues in her power either.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, Qing Shui realized that his women were doing much better than he was. He didn't even get himself the position of a sect lord. No, that wasn't right. He was the Patriarch of the Heavenly Palace...</p>
 <p>That night, Qing Shui had a long night with Yu Sunu. He couldn't get enough of her intoxicating body and this wasn't the first time. Eldest Princess was now less restrained. At the very least, she could take the initiative to match Qing Shui in different positions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui loved to see her riding on him the most, shaking slowly and gently while wearing an extremely beautiful expression that had both embarrassment and a seductive charm.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stayed for about three days and the ladies gained tremendous improvement in their cultivation. Even the Seventh Princess and Yan Jinyu had both had acupuncture applied by Qing Shui to strengthen their foundation. Qing Sha's case was the most unique. Not only did Qing Shui helped to strengthen her foundation and nurture her constitution, he even cleared many of her acupuncture points and reinforced as many of her meridian channels as he could.</p>
 <p>There were some meridian channels which she didn't need to have reinforced but that wasn't the case for Qing Shui. The meridian channels throughout her body all had either stored or had pernicious aura flowing through them. Therefore, Qing Shui used almost two days to strengthen all of her meridian channels and also left many Constitution Nurturing Pills behind for her.</p>
 <p>This time around, the ladies used the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellets and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets. This made Qing Shui more assured. The importance of these two pellets was as important as a person's brain. A cultivator could be said to rely on these two meridian channels.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha's condition wasn't easy. In the future, the lass would still have to go through tribulations and she wasn't one who would rely on others, not even him. She would only bear the hatred in her heart by herself, thus what Qing Shui wanted to do was to bring Qing Sha's power to the strongest he could.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui returned to the Dancing Phoenix Continent, it had been over ten days. Qing Clan and the Western Oxhe Continent had been progressing well and right now, what he needed to do was to build up his own territory in these three continents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to have reached a bottleneck in his cultivation and the rate of progress was slowing down. However, it was still acceptable. After having used up the Origin Returning Pills and also after finishing up the One-Yang Pills, Two-Yang Pills and Three-Yang Pills, his strength increased by 120 sun. The amount of medicinal pills that would take others ten years to finish took Qing Shui only slightly over a month.</p>
 <p>The 120 sun was really insignificant to the current Qing Shui. However, one sun was 10,000 nimbus and 3,000 nimbus would make one a Grade One State Master. A Grade One State Master could take the Yang Pills and therefore, if a person could reach the level of a State Master, Qing Shui would be able to let the person's strength increase tremendously by 120 sun within ten years without having the person do anything.</p>
 <p>The Yang Pills were considered miraculous pills to State Masters. Just the One-Yang Pills would be able to increase a Grade One State Master's strength by many fold, let alone the Two-Yang Pills and Three-Yang Pills. This was also why the Yang Pills were so precious. Formation Immortal Sect's Black and White Elders had remained as Grade One State Masters for many years. If Qing Shui hadn't gotten his hands on the Nine Yang Pharmacopoeia, he would have missed out on the Yang Pills as well.</p>
 <p>After a short chat with Soulsearch and Yuan Su, Qing Shui went back to his room and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Right now, he wanted to attempt to refine the Four-Yang Pills. He felt that it was about the right time now.</p>
 <p>By rights, after half a year had passed, it hadn't even been 100 years in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, with the Spiritual Medicinal Beasts and the Flower of Life and he had even splurged to water the plants with the Spring of Life, the medicinal effect of the herbs should be sufficient for him to refine the Four-Yang Pills. He didn't lack any of the herbs when he tried to refine it the previous time. The reason he had waited for such a long time before making another attempt was also to increase his chances.</p>
 <p>There was a huge demarcation between the Three-Yang Pills and the Four-Yang Pills. He didn't know what changes there were to the Four-Yang Pills or if they had any unique effects.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very agitated. It was because the Yang Pills were also very important to his Nine Yang Golden Body. Right now, his Nine Yang Golden Body had already reached the great perfection stage. He hoped to be able to attain a breakthrough to the grand perfection stage before reaching the eighth heavenly layer or False God. It was because if that happened, the chances of him succeeding in attaining a breakthrough to the eighth heavenly layer or the False God would be higher.</p>
