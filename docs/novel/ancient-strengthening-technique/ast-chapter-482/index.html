 <p><strong>Chapter 482 Tiger Vitality Pill, Huoyun Liu-Li and Jin Guyao.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 482 - Tiger Vitality Pill, Huoyun Liu-Li and Jin Guyao</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effects: Strength the Dantian by 20%, only one pill can be eaten!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Strong!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the feeling Qing Shui got, it was a pity that all the ingredients were rare, but he had a few. As the same time, he now knew why Feng Shamo had Martial Saint Level Demonic Beast parts, it was for this recipe, he just did not know how he got his hands on these Martial Saint Level Demonic Beast parts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that although the Asura Flower was difficult to obtain, if he could get it, then the recipe would be completed. All the ingredients in Feng Shamo’s Interspatial silk sachet, as well as the things in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, would allow Qing Shui to directly refine these recipes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Picking up the small bottle at the side, it was as he guessed, a bottle of Tiger Vitality Pill, it was, after all, the most inferior recipe of the lot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No one will complain about having too much strength, even at his age, Feng Shamo was still taking these pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Checking it with his spiritual sense, he could not feel any abnormalities!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly thinking of his Five Dragon Pellet, it was a pity that he did not eat it then, resulting in the Old Ancestor having to prolong his life to buy time for healing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Had Qing Shui just eaten a Five Dragon Pellet, it would have been better, at least he would not have to trouble the Old Ancestor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Five Dragon Pellet can resolve all negative effects, it was effective against poisons, mental attacks, hallucinatory drugs completely removing them all! Aside from internal injury and life-threatening injuries, it can heal everything within a short period of time. It can even slightly raise the body’s constitution. When suffering from severe injury, as long as it was not insta-death, the Five Dragon Pellet can preserve your life for 24 hours.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Never mind, let’s try one regardless if there is an effect or not, to see if it is effective on the internal damage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui swallowed a Five Dragon Pellet. Since the recipe of this Medicinal Pill uses ingredients with healing properties, it should be a pretty good healing medicine, thus Qing Shui felt it should be effective in treating his internal injuries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A cooling energy flowed down his throat, at that moment Qing Shui could feel his spine shake, at the moment, he felt incomparably comfortable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Following that, a cooling energy slowly spread to every bit of his body, Qing Shui’s Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique quickly merged with that cooling energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Huh, this kind of healing effect is only considered light healing?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the rate of recovery of his injuries was terrifyingly fast. Qing Shui had forgotten about his own body’s strength. The recovery abilities of his body was practically at a speed where the healing can be seen with the naked eye.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique, focusing on the recovery of the area around his heart!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly stopped only when that cooling energy was gone, the effects were satisfactory. Qing Shui believed that he can completely heal his body before leaving the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spent most of his time circulating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, occasionally eating a Five Dragon Pellet, or practising the Taichi Fist. the rest of the time he reviewed some of his other materials, the Poison Scriptures, Heavenly Talisman, Mutated beasts, Medicinal encyclopedia…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Qing Shui had eaten 10 Tiger Vitality Pill, increasing his strength by 10 thousand Jin. No matter how miniscule, it was still an increase in strength, furthermore there was a hundred pills in the bottle and Qing Shui had the confidence of being able to refine it soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, it had reached the time to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui could feel that his body was basically healed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The second day, Qing Shui woke up early!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a habit, since he was healed already, he might as well!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he came out to the courtyard, he noticed the 2 girls were outside. Canghai Mingyue was practicing the Taichi fist that Qing Shui usually practiced, and Huoyun Liu-Li was practicing a sword dance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you up already, you should rest more.” When Huoyun Liu-Li saw Qing Shui came out, she pouted and put down her sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue also stopped and looked at Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m fine already, if you don’t believe you can come and check!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Check what?” At this moment, Mingyue Gelou came out smiling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister Lou, please try to persuade Qing Shui, before his body is healed, he wants to come out and practice” Huoyun Liu-Li hurriedly told Mingyue Gelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m fine already, it is not as though you are not aware that my body is very resilient?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This careless phrase of his caused the three girls to blush, Mingyue Gelou even lowered her head, Canghai Mingyue avoided his gaze. However, Huoyun Liu-Li playfully looked at Qing Shui while blushing, then looked at Mingyue Gelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister Lou, I don’t know, is Qing Shui’s body really that strong?” her tone sounded like she was interrogating her…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was originally embarrassed, upon hearing his abilities being questioned and looking at that crafty charming face, Qing Shui really wanted to prove it to her. However, now was not the time, he felt helpless, this was not the first time he was teased by her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou was so embarrassed she could not even raise her head!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, if you don’t try it you won’t know, after all, it is just a matter of time. You can ask your sister Lou, the passionate love between a man and woman is the most wonderful thing in the world, it increases you strength. Oh! I just remembered, the Misty Hall’s cultivation methods seems to be Duo Cultivation.” Qing Shui playfully looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, feeling particularly vengeful.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li turned her head and looked at Qing Shui, her eyebrows were thin, she was blushing very heavily, looking very cute. At this moment, she blinked her very sexy eyes at Qing Shui, and stuck her tongue out at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Maybe she was acting cute, but it made Qing Shui’s heart itch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Demoness, you demoness, I’m going to eat you up someday.” Qing Shui murmured.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui brought Mingyue Gelou back, her improvements were quite good. During that period where she was taken away by Tan Yang, her cultivation had no improvements at all, not wanting to hurt her, Qing Shui did not mentioned it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This past year, Mingyue Gelou had led a happy life. Qing Shui kept telling himself, he absolutely cannot let the women by his side feel wronged by others, no matter who it is.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just that once already caused Qing Shui an unforgettable pain. It had required a long time for him to recover from that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyu Gelou, who had all her meridians cleared, could cultivate very fast. Currently, she was a 6th grade Xiantian, due to the help of the Threefold Spirit Concentrating Pill and Qing Shui using the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to temper her meridians and bones.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was an 8th Grade Xiantian!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her cultivation had a lot of setbacks, being able to cultivate to this level was already pretty good. Qing Shui could feel that their aptitudes had changed a lot this year, her rate of improvement was not inferior to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Here, these are for you, find some time to take it, each pill can increase your strength by 1000 Jin, you may take 10 every year. Currently, I only have so many, after I refined more, I’ll give them to you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui said that, he pass the Tiger Vitality Pill to the three girls!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Especially Mingyue Gelou, although her cultivation was high but had low strength. These 10 Tiger Vitality Pill that would add 10 thousand Jin of strength would be significant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is for you.” Qing Shui gave the Interspatial silk sachet to Mingyue Gelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I do not need this, keep it for youself.” Mingyue Gelou pushed the Interspatial silk sachet back to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have better ones. Why? Not satisfied with it?” Qing Shui smiled at Mingyue Gelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, this is too precious.” Mingyue Gelou smiled back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“When you are outside, its best to not let people see it, disguising the exterior would save you some trouble.” Qing Shui reminded the three girls.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui faced the sun and practised a few round of Taichi Fist, the girls had left to make breakfast!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When it was time to eat, it was lively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had recovered, thus the atmosphere at the table was more joyous.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Gramps, What happened to Bloody Butcher?” Qing Shui asked Cang Wuya after eating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He is dead, his cultivation got crippled, plus his lifespan was coming to an end. He could not take the blow and committed suicide.” Cang Wuya regretfully said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I wonder, where is the carcass of the Tigon Beast Champion?” Qing Shui was actually quite concerned about the carcass of the Tigon Beast Champion, after all, he wanted to use it to draw talismens.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, that thing…… we have already processed it’s skin, tendon inner core, bones…… after a while, you can go to the Elder Xing to retrieve it.” Cang Wuya laughed and looked at Qing Shui, as he serve him a cup of water.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turned red with embarrassment and laughed: “I have some use for those things!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Used to draw the Talismans you used in battle right?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En! Gramps understands!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I know a little, I hear that quite a lot of people uses them in other continents, thus I felt it was useful to you and got people to keep it. It is after all, a battle trophy, and a Peak Martial King Demonic Beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, there were footsteps outside the door!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Junior Jing Changzhang asks to see Old Master Cang.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui followed Cang Wuya outside the door, Fei Wuji and the other girls came out as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Little brother, how are your wounds?” Jin Guyao asked in concern.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hypocrite!” Huoyun Liu-Li snorted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Greetings Old Master Cang and Elder Fei!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing, congratulations on beating the Feng Clan, looks like your body is fine already.” Jin Changzhang greeted Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji before saying that to Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m fine, why are you guys here?” Qing Shui lightly smiled as he looked at Jin Changzhang and Jin Guyao.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We are worried about you!” Jin Guyao said, looking at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Worried about Qing Shui? When he was unconscious for seven days, even Feng Yu from the Feng Clan came by. What were you doing during these seven days?” Huoyun Liu-Li got angry just at the thought of it. The seven days when Qing Shui was unconscious, the Jin Clan did not even send a single person, now that he is better, they are here to greet him, how hypocritical!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now felt a little bit of distaste towards Jin Guyao, as for the Jin Clan not helping him, he did not feel a grudge. However, when he was injuried during those seven days, they did not even send a single person. It was clear that he was not in their heart, why should he warm up to them?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Maybe they thought that he would die, after all, at that time, no one thought that he could live.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The path was chosen by them, since they can’t be friends, then they will just be passerbys.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui did not have many friends, he did not want to just simply make friends!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why do you say this? We came from afar to see Qing Shui, on what basis are you slandering us? Who are you and what are you to Qing Shui? Even he did not say this, what do you count for? Jin Guyua looked at Huoyun Liu-Li with disdain. She, as the Jin Clan’s young miss, have never received taunts like this from others before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After she said that, Jin Guyao turned her head towards Qing Shui: “Little brother……”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the rate of recovery of his injuries was terrifyingly fast. Qing Shui had forgotten about his own body’s strength. The recovery abilities of his body was practically at a speed where the healing can be seen with the naked eye.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique, focusing on the recovery of the area around his heart!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly stopped only when that cooling energy was gone, the effects were satisfactory. Qing Shui believed that he can completely heal his body before leaving the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui spent most of his time circulating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, occasionally eating a Five Dragon Pellet, or practising the Taichi Fist. the rest of the time he reviewed some of his other materials, the Poison Scriptures, Heavenly Talisman, Mutated beasts, Medicinal encyclopedia…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Qing Shui had eaten 10 Tiger Vitality Pill, increasing his strength by 10 thousand Jin. No matter how miniscule, it was still an increase in strength, furthermore there was a hundred pills in the bottle and Qing Shui had the confidence of being able to refine it soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, it had reached the time to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui could feel that his body was basically healed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The second day, Qing Shui woke up early!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a habit, since he was healed already, he might as well!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he came out to the courtyard, he noticed the 2 girls were outside. Canghai Mingyue was practicing the Taichi fist that Qing Shui usually practiced, and Huoyun Liu-Li was practicing a sword dance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you up already, you should rest more.” When Huoyun Liu-Li saw Qing Shui came out, she pouted and put down her sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue also stopped and looked at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m fine already, if you don’t believe you can come and check!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Check what?” At this moment, Mingyue Gelou came out smiling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister Lou, please try to persuade Qing Shui, before his body is healed, he wants to come out and practice” Huoyun Liu-Li hurriedly told Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m fine already, it is not as though you are not aware that my body is very resilient?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This careless phrase of his caused the three girls to blush, Mingyue Gelou even lowered her head, Canghai Mingyue avoided his gaze. However, Huoyun Liu-Li playfully looked at Qing Shui while blushing, then looked at Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister Lou, I don’t know, is Qing Shui’s body really that strong?” her tone sounded like she was interrogating her…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was originally embarrassed, upon hearing his abilities being questioned and looking at that crafty charming face, Qing Shui really wanted to prove it to her. However, now was not the time, he felt helpless, this was not the first time he was teased by her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou was so embarrassed she could not even raise her head!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, if you don’t try it you won’t know, after all, it is just a matter of time. You can ask your sister Lou, the passionate love between a man and woman is the most wonderful thing in the world, it increases you strength. Oh! I just remembered, the Misty Hall’s cultivation methods seems to be Duo Cultivation.” Qing Shui playfully looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, feeling particularly vengeful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li turned her head and looked at Qing Shui, her eyebrows were thin, she was blushing very heavily, looking very cute. At this moment, she blinked her very sexy eyes at Qing Shui, and stuck her tongue out at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Maybe she was acting cute, but it made Qing Shui’s heart itch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Demoness, you demoness, I’m going to eat you up someday.” Qing Shui murmured.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui brought Mingyue Gelou back, her improvements were quite good. During that period where she was taken away by Tan Yang, her cultivation had no improvements at all, not wanting to hurt her, Qing Shui did not mentioned it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This past year, Mingyue Gelou had led a happy life. Qing Shui kept telling himself, he absolutely cannot let the women by his side feel wronged by others, no matter who it is.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just that once already caused Qing Shui an unforgettable pain. It had required a long time for him to recover from that.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyu Gelou, who had all her meridians cleared, could cultivate very fast. Currently, she was a 6th grade Xiantian, due to the help of the Threefold Spirit Concentrating Pill and Qing Shui using the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to temper her meridians and bones.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was an 8th Grade Xiantian!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her cultivation had a lot of setbacks, being able to cultivate to this level was already pretty good. Qing Shui could feel that their aptitudes had changed a lot this year, her rate of improvement was not inferior to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Here, these are for you, find some time to take it, each pill can increase your strength by 1000 Jin, you may take 10 every year. Currently, I only have so many, after I refined more, I’ll give them to you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui said that, he pass the Tiger Vitality Pill to the three girls!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Especially Mingyue Gelou, although her cultivation was high but had low strength. These 10 Tiger Vitality Pill that would add 10 thousand Jin of strength would be significant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is for you.” Qing Shui gave the Interspatial silk sachet to Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I do not need this, keep it for youself.” Mingyue Gelou pushed the Interspatial silk sachet back to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have better ones. Why? Not satisfied with it?” Qing Shui smiled at Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, this is too precious.” Mingyue Gelou smiled back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“When you are outside, its best to not let people see it, disguising the exterior would save you some trouble.” Qing Shui reminded the three girls.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui faced the sun and practised a few round of Taichi Fist, the girls had left to make breakfast!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When it was time to eat, it was lively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had recovered, thus the atmosphere at the table was more joyous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Gramps, What happened to Bloody Butcher?” Qing Shui asked Cang Wuya after eating.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He is dead, his cultivation got crippled, plus his lifespan was coming to an end. He could not take the blow and committed suicide.” Cang Wuya regretfully said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I wonder, where is the carcass of the Tigon Beast Champion?” Qing Shui was actually quite concerned about the carcass of the Tigon Beast Champion, after all, he wanted to use it to draw talismens.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, that thing…… we have already processed it’s skin, tendon inner core, bones…… after a while, you can go to the Elder Xing to retrieve it.” Cang Wuya laughed and looked at Qing Shui, as he serve him a cup of water.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turned red with embarrassment and laughed: “I have some use for those things!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Used to draw the Talismans you used in battle right?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En! Gramps understands!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I know a little, I hear that quite a lot of people uses them in other continents, thus I felt it was useful to you and got people to keep it. It is after all, a battle trophy, and a Peak Martial King Demonic Beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, there were footsteps outside the door!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Junior Jing Changzhang asks to see Old Master Cang.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui followed Cang Wuya outside the door, Fei Wuji and the other girls came out as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Little brother, how are your wounds?” Jin Guyao asked in concern.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hypocrite!” Huoyun Liu-Li snorted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Greetings Old Master Cang and Elder Fei!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing, congratulations on beating the Feng Clan, looks like your body is fine already.” Jin Changzhang greeted Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji before saying that to Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m fine, why are you guys here?” Qing Shui lightly smiled as he looked at Jin Changzhang and Jin Guyao.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We are worried about you!” Jin Guyao said, looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Worried about Qing Shui? When he was unconscious for seven days, even Feng Yu from the Feng Clan came by. What were you doing during these seven days?” Huoyun Liu-Li got angry just at the thought of it. The seven days when Qing Shui was unconscious, the Jin Clan did not even send a single person, now that he is better, they are here to greet him, how hypocritical!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now felt a little bit of distaste towards Jin Guyao, as for the Jin Clan not helping him, he did not feel a grudge. However, when he was injuried during those seven days, they did not even send a single person. It was clear that he was not in their heart, why should he warm up to them?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Maybe they thought that he would die, after all, at that time, no one thought that he could live.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The path was chosen by them, since they can’t be friends, then they will just be passerbys.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui did not have many friends, he did not want to just simply make friends!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why do you say this? We came from afar to see Qing Shui, on what basis are you slandering us? Who are you and what are you to Qing Shui? Even he did not say this, what do you count for? Jin Guyua looked at Huoyun Liu-Li with disdain. She, as the Jin Clan’s young miss, have never received taunts like this from others before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After she said that, Jin Guyao turned her head towards Qing Shui: “Little brother……”</p>
