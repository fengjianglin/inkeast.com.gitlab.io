 <p><strong>AST 662 - Poison Beast Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui exchanged some pleasantries with the attendees. In the end, all of them were once again gathered in the big hall, mainly to discuss the number of battle participants. Many of them wished to add another two participants. After all, Qianyu Dingjun, Nian Feng’s grandfather, and Lady Duanmu were all famous and powerful figures.</p>
 <p>Nian Clan and Qianyu Clan had rushed here this time because they wanted to help care of Old Demon Ba. However, they didn’t make it in time for that. Instead, they made it in time for this Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death.</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu should have gotten word of this fight before she had returned to the Duanmu City and had probably made her way back in the middle of her journey.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carefully reconsidered his options. In the end, he still decided to stand firmly with his own opinion in having three participants to take part in the fight. If the opponents were five Grade Ten Martial Saint cultivators, it’d be useless even if they had two more people. If the opponents were only one or two Grade Eight or Nine Martial Saints, then Qing Shui had the confidence to immediately kill them.</p>
 <p>The others didn’t say anything about Qing Shui’s firm decision. But in the end, he still yielded to Qianyu Dingjun with a smile. The grandfather and grandson duo of Nian Clan were left out to keep an eye, in case the Thousand Poisons Sect had some other things going on.</p>
 <p>Currently, Qing Shui only entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal after midnight so he was especially free after dinner. He was sitting side by side with Di Chen in her room while they chatted leisurely.</p>
 <p>This was also the first night they had spent time alone at the Di Clan. Tomorrow would be the last day before the ‘Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death’. Qing Shui leaned back while he sat and held one of Di Chen’s hand contently.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you in the least bit worried?” Di Chen turned her face to the side to look at Qing Shui who was next to her. Although she wasn’t very sure about their relationship, she was already acting so close to Qing Shui as though she was ‘chasing him’ and was already certain of her relationship with him.</p>
 <p>“Worried about what? There’s no use in worrying as it’s better to think about how to survive instead. I want to be able to go sightseeing with a beautiful thing like you. Then we can make lots of babies. Life will be very good.” Qing Shui said lightly and laughed.</p>
 <p>He really wasn’t that worried anymore after his strength had increased tremendously. He had his trump cards and he felt like he could still handle things even if his opponents were a little stronger. However, he still needed to be tread carefully around potential dangers and risks.</p>
 <p>“You’re still in the mood to spout such nonsense?” Di Chen huffed in annoyance as she gave Qing Shui a light punch.</p>
 <p>“I am not spouting nonsense. You are my wife, isn’t it normal to have children with you in the future? I’ll leave it up to you to decide how many we should have though. So how many do you think we should have?” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“What children? If you keep up with this nonsense, I’ll ignore you,” Di Chen rolled her eyes. She was speechless at Qing Shui but deep down her heart, she was still very happy.</p>
 <p>This man was only reserved in front of her in the past and he was quite uptight. Although he was only teasing her now, it was still a great improvement because he had opened up to her emotionally. Or maybe that was also a kind of gain in confidence. He had more confidence in unknown things.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. I am not spouting nonsense. I am being serious.” Qing Shui daringly pulled her into his arms by her waist.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be naughty and don’t move. Otherwise, I will really ignore you,” Di Chen said frantically. As soon as she was startled, she already found herself in Qing Shui’s arms.</p>
 <p>“So I can only look but not eat. Let me touch…...:”</p>
 <p>“Don’t move!” Di Chen reprimanded.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped moving. Just embracing her was a special enjoyment itself. He could feel her smooth and resilient skin through her thin layer of clothing, especially that fine rear that he yearned for. It was full and round but not too large. It was also perky but not overly so. Those marvelous curves of excelling nature were not only pleasing to his eyes but they also shook him to his very core.</p>
 <p>His hand had somehow ‘accidentally’ ended up underneath her beautiful rear when he had pulled her into his arms. He was currently lost in the pure ecstasy that shot up from his arm.</p>
 <p>The ecstasy was bone deep and soul stirring. That kind of sensation could only be felt but not conveyed in words. This was because no one would be able to completely put this feeling into words.</p>
 <p>“Embracing you makes me feel very tranquil, satisfied, happy and proud. I hope you can be the happiest woman in this world, but I don’t know what to do,” Qing Shui said gently in a serene voice.</p>
 <p>“I am very happy right now. Happiness has no standard measurement, it is simply a type of feeling. Just like how not having to worry about clothes and food would be a great happiness to a beggar. However, if a tycoon suddenly becomes a peasant, he would be so grieved that he’d wish he was dead. Some people are very happy although they may not look like it to the others. I don’t have anything more I could possibly ask for, even now. I’m very happy and feel very blessed.” Di Chen said as she leaned her beautiful face against Qing Shui’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Do you know how I felt when I saw peerless beauties like you all in the past?” Qing Shui looked at Di Chen who was in his arms with a smile while looking slightly rueful.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Tell me. I’m quite curious,” Di Chen lifted her head up and smiled. She seemed like she was genuinely interested.</p>
 <p>“So it seems like there are also times when your interest is piqued. How rare.”</p>
 <p>“Cut it out, it’s not like I’m some sort of divine being.”</p>
 <p>“But you are a divine being in my eyes. A goddess……”</p>
 <p>“Alright, hurry up and tell me. Stop changing the topic.” Di Chen speechlessly gave Qing Shui a glare.</p>
 <p>“When I saw peerless beauties like you in the past, I never imagined that I could interact so closely with them like how I’m right now. In my mind, I felt like they wouldn’t speak with or come into contact with normal people…..”</p>
 <p>Di Chen gave Qing Shui a perplexed look. She was clueless about what Qing Shui was trying to say. She waited until he was done before saying slowly. “I don’t think I am able to catch what you are really trying to say.”</p>
 <p>“This isn’t important. Anyway, I find it hard to believe that a girl like you would want to marry me. I didn’t expect you would be attracted to me…….”</p>
 <p>“Who is attracted to you? How shameless of you.” Di Chen got up from Qing Shui and huffed. “I’m going to rest. You may stay in the study room for tonight.”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t we stay together in the bedroom? We can even have a chat at night....”</p>
 <p>“Dream on!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched smilingly as Di Chen left because she didn’t know how to deal with him. He had also felt that she was unconsciously changing over time. The smiles on her face had become more frequent and she had also gained the emotions that a girl should have. Sometimes she would act spoiled, sometimes she would be very adorable…...</p>
 <p>After sitting for awhile in the living room, he walked towards the study room. There weren’t many books in the study room. Qing Shui had skimmed through them before but he hadn’t found anything interesting so he had never touched any of them after that.</p>
 <p>The Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Something felt different the moment he stepped into the realm but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. He didn’t let it bother him too much either, but he was soon dumbstruck.</p>
 <p>It was the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. It had surprisingly turned pitch black and its body size seemed to have shrunk a lot compared to before. However, its abilities had reached the Martial Saint level.</p>
 <p>Jade Emperor Queen Bee at the Martial Saint level…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pensively glanced towards the porcelain bottle that contained the Poisonous Dragon Pearl. He discovered that the porcelain bottle was already empty and there was no sight of the Poisonous Dragon Pearl anywhere. Needless to say, the Jade Emperor Queen Bee must have eaten it.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, he could feel an intense sinister cold qi exuded from the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. Qing Shui couldn’t help but scan it with his Heavenly Vision Technique, in hopes of gleaning some useful information out of it.</p>
 <p>Jade Emperor Poisonous Queen Bee: Mutated species. Evolved from swallowing a Poisonous Dragon Pearl. Expert in flight and poison attacks.</p>
 <p>The information he got was very little but he at least had a rough idea on what had happened now. He was also able to confirm that the bee had eaten the Poisonous Dragon Pearl. Most importantly, Qing Shui didn’t expect that this Jade Emperor Queen Bee would be able to successfully gobble up that Poisonous Dragon Pearl without being poisoned to death and without exploding from the Poisonous Dragon Pearl’s burst of energy. It was indeed an unexpected success on its part and this had also proven that the Jade Emperor Queen Bee had a very decent aptitude. The rewards from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal seemed to be truly formidable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spiritual sense had also improved by leaps and bounds after this breakthrough. He could sense a lot of more things that he couldn’t previously.</p>
 <p>Summoning the Jade Emperor Queen Bee, or more like the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee now, it arrived in front of Qing Shui in just a short while. Compared to before, it looked as if it was fully armored. The pitch black scales gleamed coldly as they exuded a freezing aura.</p>
 <p>He was unsure if it was because his abilities had gained a tremendous increase but he felt that his bond with the Emperor Jade Queen Bee was even stronger than before. He then tried to make the Emperor Jade Poison Queen Bee perform a few simple attacks.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui also checked out the abilities of the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee.</p>
 <p>Gale Speed!</p>
 <p>This was an ability of the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee which could instantaneously boost its speed. Although it wasn’t as absurd as the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Instantaneous Diamond Evasion, it was superior in terms of its duration as the effect could last for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Poison Pierce!</p>
 <p>A poison attack that could make the opponent feel dizzy and uneasy. A weak cultivator could immediately die from it.</p>
 <p>Poison Killer Sting!</p>
 <p>The killing technique of bee-species demonic beasts. By shooting out the poisonous needle at the tip of its tail, the toxicity could be raised by two-fold and the penetrating power was exceptionally strong. Ordinary armors and shields wouldn’t be able to withstand this attack. With its astonishingly high speed, not many people could evade this poisonous sting attack either.</p>
 <p>Queen Bee’s Command!</p>
 <p>The Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee was the champion among bee-species demonic beasts. Not only could it command all the other bee-species demonic beasts within a radius of 30 li but it could also breed the next generation of poisonous bees as well as to command the swarm of poisonous bees to attack.</p>
 <p>A Martial Saint level Poison Beast. On top of that, it was a King Grade Poison Beast that was an expert in flight. It had also gobbled up a Poison Dragon Pearl. Qing Shui had never expected things to turn out like this. He had only thought of using the Poison Dragon Pearl to increase the toxicity of the poison beings around it. He would never feed the Poison Dragon Pearl to the Jade Poison Queen Bee on his own accord no matter what. If he were to do that, it was possible that he would not only lose the Poison Dragon Pearl but the Jade Emperor Queen Bee as well.</p>
 <p>He had gained another powerful demonic beast. On top of that, it was a King Grade Poison Beast that could continuously breed Poison Beasts. Given some time, the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee that led an innumerable number of poisonous bees would become something that could not be underestimated. After all, it was a Martial Saint level Poison Beast.</p>
 <p>With this, the odds of winning the ‘Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death’ became a little higher again. Qing Shui had a hunch that this Jade Emperor Queen Bee wasn’t something that could be compared to ordinary poison beasts.</p>
 <p>Taichi Fists!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui began to practice his Taichi Fists within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He must refine and harmonize the tremendous power increase within this short amount of time. This was the only way he could bring his strength to its peak.</p>
 <p>Other than resting, Qing Shui would also take some time to refine the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb. He had added the ‘crystals’ produced by the ‘Crystal Lions’ this time around. Adding these crystals to poisons could double their toxicity. He then used the ‘crystals’ to refine the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb. His remaining time was spent on practicing his Taichi Fists.</p>
 <p>Time slowly passed. Qing Shui was completely wrapped up in his cultivation in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal as he integrated the tremendous energy into his body little by little, trying to make it become part of himself.</p>
