 <p><strong>AST 679 - Yuan Su’s worries</strong></p>
 <p>“Are you really sure that you want to learn?” Qing Shui asked Di Xian with a smile.</p>
 <p>Maybe because Qing Shui looked really relaxed when he said it, Di Xian let out a sigh of relief and smiled: “As long as uncle is willing to teach me, I am really keen to learn it.”</p>
 <p>This little brat was really quick witted. Not only was there a certain standard to the things she said, she was really good at understanding people’s thoughts. She must have felt that there wasn’t much change in Qing Shui’s emotions. That was why she commented about him not teaching her. What she meant was that if Qing Shui didn’t teach her, it would just mean that he was selfish.</p>
 <p>“As long as you’re willing to learn, I will teach you. But it’s not so easy to learn this, you have to prepare yourself for it.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Qing Shui’s words, the little brat blushed. She realized that Qing Shui was able to interpret what she meant from her words and gave an awkward smile: “Uncle is the best, I will try my best to learn it. I’m not afraid of suffering. As long as I get to learn uncle’s mystical battle technique, I don’t care how much I have to suffer.”</p>
 <p>Suffering often would result in one’s growth. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing for Di Clan to experience something like this. At least, unlike before, they were able to see over a lot of stuff now and they got to widen their view towards the world. Even the younger generations of the clan managed to mature a lot.</p>
 <p>“This technique is known as the Hidden Weapon Technique. When you are cultivating Hidden Weapons, you need to cultivate your hand movements as well as the coordination of your body. Of course, power definitely cannot come short at crucial times!”</p>
 <p>“Alright uncle, I'll listen to whatever you say.” Di Xian responded happily.</p>
 <p>“For starter, I'll teach you three things. The first thing that I'm going to teach you is my Fist Techniques. You have to make sure that you practice them everyday. The next thing I'm going to teach you is a hand technique known as the Solitary Rapid Fist. Last but not least, the thing that you are going to learn is the Deer Cantering. It can help increase your speed.” Qing Shui explained after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Di Xian happily promised Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui started off by teaching her the Taichi Fist. Since she has been observing Qing Shui’s movement from the side prior to this, she was able to learn it very quickly. It's just like she was copying his form.</p>
 <p>Cultivating Fist Techniques always starts from mimicking the form, to be able to cultivate until the Essence of Fist Techniques can be understood or their fist to be filled with spirit like Qing Shui does would require a tremendous amount of time and talent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went through some of the most important features about the Taichi Fist thoroughly with her. He didn't neglect any part of it including the most crucial one which was about having a calm mind. Not only did he do that, he even forced her to memorize them. He would only consider them done once she did it.</p>
 <p>As for the Solitary Rapid Fist, there was only one default move to it. It all depended on the person’s talents if they could mix in new skills in the future. No one could help her with this one. Hence, Qing Shui only explained to her about the essential points of the Solitary Rapid Fist.</p>
 <p>Deer Catering was really easy but if these were all added up together, it would become really time consuming. Nevertheless, the most important thing was to never give up. Without determination, it's very hard to achieve anything with regards to these battle techniques.</p>
 <p>“All of these might seem easy, but they are all really time consuming. You always have to remember that the easier something is, the harder it is to understand the Essence of it. This is because it's hard to feel the essence hidden within it if it is too easy.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped adding anything more. His Basic Sword Technique was a classic example of what he just said. Not only that, there were a lot of people outside of Qing Clan who knew that the Basic Sword Technique was the only sword skill that Qing Shui could perform, yet he was able to use it in a simple yet flexible way, causing people to feel like he was using some divine techniques which could go toe-to-toe with a Grade Ten Martial Saint warrior. As a result, a lot of people started turning back to cultivate the Basic Sword Technique.</p>
 <p>But it's all futile now. The Basic Sword Technique was just like the base of a house. Since the house was already built, the foundation of the house had already been set. No matter how much time they spent on the Basic Sword Techniques, they still wouldn't be able to achieve anything.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I will.” Di Xian said seriously</p>
 <p>“Around this time in the upcoming days, you can come here to practice if there aren’t any important things for you to do. I’ll only let you practice on your own after you’ve walked up the right path.” Qing Shui looked into the sky and said.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, I'll come everyday. This is the most important thing for me.”</p>
 <p>For now, there would often be servants to serve meals in his room. After Qing Shui separated from Di Xian, he went on and proceeded to Di Chen’s room. He didn't know if Di Chen was still waiting for him to have their meals together since it was already well past breakfast time.</p>
 <p>By the time he went back to his room, he noticed that both Di Qing and Yuan Su were there. When the two saw Qing Shui back, they happily greeted him.</p>
 <p>The food on the table hadn’t been touched, which obviously meant that the girls had been waiting for Qing Shui to come back to enjoy their meals together.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, how is Xian`er’s talent?” Di Qing chuckled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. It seemed like the little brat has already told Di Qing about asking Qing Shui to teach her how to cultivate before heading off to learn his Hidden Weapons.</p>
 <p>“She’s quite talented. It's just that she is still too young and her temperament is too unstable. However, I believe that very quickly, the time for her to significantly improve will come.” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Before, when Qing Shui was teaching Di Xian a few techniques, the little brat had also managed to show terrifying learning abilities. If she was given enough time and became more mature, she would definitely be able to achieve great things.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, that's why I told her to go look for you instead. You’re the person she admires the most, she will definitely listen to whatever you say.” Di Qing chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let's eat first. We will talk about this later.” Di Chen said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you sure you can really heal my meridians?” By the time they were done eating, Yuan Su asked Qing Shui gently.</p>
 <p>Actually, when Qing Shui first spotted Yuan Su, he already knew that she came here today for this. Since both Di Chen and Di Qing were present, Qing Shui didn't feel like hiding it as this would result in them feeling suspicious. If this was the case, it would be better if he just confessed it.</p>
 <p>“I should be able to do it!” Qing Shui responded after thinking for a while. Since his Primordial Flame had ascended one grade and his Spirit Energy had gotten much more powerful, his Acupuncture should more or less have improved as well.</p>
 <p>“Then can you please help me?” Yuan Su hesitated for a while before looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>To be honest, this put Qing Shui in quite a difficult position. Letting a beautiful woman go naked for him to perform Acupuncture on her… Qing Shui didn't see himself as a noble man. But in any case, he felt that should still retain his principles.</p>
 <p>“Well, tell me about the rewards you want first. As long as you are able to satisfy me, I will satisfy you.” Seeing as Qing Shui was a bit hesitant, Yuan Su responded back to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, could it be that you really want to take advantage on Sister Su?!” Di Qing glanced at Qing Shui calmly with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui replied with a bitter smile: “what kind of a person do you think I am? The thing is, when I'm treating you, not only will I have to perform Acupuncture on you, I will also have to pierce it through your sea of Qi. Most importantly, you have to be naked when I'm doing it.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a lot more relaxed after he said it. He chose to tell her about the problems first and let her decide on her own. It was the right choice considering the other two girls were also present.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was stunned. Previously, Qing Shui has mentioned before that even though he might be able to treat her conditions, he would rather not do it. Now, she finally understood what he meant.</p>
 <p>For the past twenty years, she couldn't manage to find anyone who was able to treat her. Now that she found one, it was really hard for her to give up on it. But if she was to choose to treat it, she would have to lie down totally naked in front of a strange man… Furthermore, this man was completely unrelated to her.</p>
 <p>For now, it was really hard for her to give up. But even if she didn't, she still found it really difficult to do what he said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the confused Yuan Su. This was life, in order to attain something, one would have to sacrifice the other. Very often, there would be times when it was really hard for one to decide what was best for them.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was expressionless with her lips sealed tight. Her eyes looked dull and remote. She was at a loss.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, he is a doctor. Doctors are just like our parents. As for whether you want to get it treated or not, it’s all up to you. I think you should give yourself two days to think about it before coming to a conclusion.” Di Qing said quickly after seeing Yuan Su’s look.</p>
 <p>Di Chen on the other hand, stood at the side and remained silent. From time to time, she would look at Qing Shui. In response to that, Qing Shui would give her a helpless smile.</p>
 <p>In the end, it’s just was Di Qing said. Yuan Su didn’t decide it straight away.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su left while Di Qing stayed behind. As soon as Yuan Su walked away, she started staring at Qing Shui, making him felt really uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>“What’re you looking at……”</p>
 <p>“Is it because Sister Su looks beautiful that you’re using curing her as an excuse to……”</p>
 <p>“There are a lot of ways for a doctor to get close to a woman. Or maybe get a woman to get close to him……” Qing Shui said while shaking his head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui explained his motives clearly from his words. What he meant was that if he really wanted to have sex with a woman, he had more than one way to do it. He wouldn't resort to this kind of method as it was really despicable.</p>
 <p>“Did you use this kind of thought to get close to my sister?” Di Qing looked at Qing Shui with her beautiful pupils.</p>
 <p>“*cough,cough* your sister is a goddess, this kind of thought isn't effective against her……” Qing Shui choked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words made Di Qing laughed. Di Chen on the other hand shot a glance at Qing Shui, making him felt that Di Chen was more cheerful these days.</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when Qing Shui was having a chat with the girls, someone knocked the door. Qing Shui opened the door and noticed that it was Di Xian.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, someone’s looking for you, do you want to go and see him?” Di Xian smiled.</p>
 <p>“Oh, who is it?” Qing Shui asked while opening up the door. As he did so, Di Xian immediately went in the room and smiled at Di Chen and Di Qing: “Auntie Chen! Auntie Qing!”</p>
 <p>“Who’s looking for uncle?” Di Qing asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Someone from Village of Longevity. Every single one of them look like philosophers. Even father never expected that people from the Village of Longevity would pay us a visit so he informed me to ask uncle if you wanted to meet them?”</p>
 <p>“The most mysterious Village of Longevity of the Seven Stars?” Qing Shui asked in confusion.</p>
 <p>“Yeah!”</p>
 <p>“Tell them that I'll be there right away.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Di Xian responded with a smile before leaving. Qing Shui instinctively started thinking about the purpose of Village of Longevity’s visit. However, one thing that Qing Shui was sure about was that they didn't harbor any bad intentions.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s go together!” Qing Shui told Di Chen and Di Qing.</p>
 <p>This place wasn't too far away from Di Clan’s main hall. However, it would still take them quite a while to walk there.</p>
 <p>The three stopped talking about things regarding Yuan Su. Nor did Qing Shui ask them if he should treat her. From Qing Shui’s perspective, it wasn't big deal. From his previous incarnation, a lot of the male doctors were gynecologists. From a doctor’s perspective, it didn't matter if the patient was a guy or a woman, they’re all patients who needed help.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and the two girls arrived at the main hall, they noticed that there weren't a lot of people. It was mostly members from Di Xuan’s branch. In addition to that, there were four old men. It's just as Di Xian said, each and everyone of them looked like wise philosophers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't able to tell their ages. Even though they had white beards and hair and they were all wearing white garments, they had spirits which could be better compared to that of the youths.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't attempt to sense their strength either. He felt that their strength should be nothing inferior to that of Qian Xiye’s.</p>
