 <p><strong>Chapter 121 All Aspect Nourishment Soup.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0121 – All Aspect Nourishment Soup</strong></p>
  <p>Yu He hurriedly followed Qing Shui, as she gazed upon the two face-sized black turtles, who were lying on their shells, with their backs on the ground and their legs facing the skies.</p>
  <p>“Let’s eat something good this afternoon, as for the remainder, pass it to the kitchen and let the rest of the staff enjoy it.” Qing Shui suggested.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, okay!”</p>
  <p>After Yu He finished giving out her instructions, she brought Qing Shui to the top level of the Yu He Inn. Qing Shui stared out of the window, looking at the surrounding buildings, before casting his gaze far across the horizon, as a sense of heroism filled his heart.</p>
  <p>Yu He was startled as she took note of the transformation Qing Shui had undergone. She could clearly feel the aura exuded by Qing Shui was much stronger than before. Inevitably, she couldn’t help but to feel a sense of loneliness in her heart.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, what are your plans for the future?” Yu He retracted her gaze, feeling a emptiness in her heart, as she asked. Silently berating herself for her strange behaviour today, she was unsure too, why she keep staring at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, after a few more years, I will go and explore the world. I want to leave a legacy in all of the most beautiful places in this world of the nine continents during my lifetime.” Qing Shui smiled as he stared at the vast skies.</p>
  <p>“Are you going alone? Could you bring me along with you?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned, and just when he was about to answer, Yu He interjected with her laughter. “Elder sister was just teasing you. Haha, you were scared for a moment right! Let’s go down, I think the turtle soup should be almost ready!”</p>
  <p>After speaking, Yu He led the way as she went down the stairs. Despite the sunny smile on her face, her heart was filled with bitterness. She couldn’t help interjecting when she saw the stunned visage of Qing Shui. At the very least, she would rather things be this way, and leave behind a beautiful memory, rather than listening to a cruel answer. This way, she would still have hope. Before Qing Shui got together with other women, she would still be happy.</p>
  <p>A few moments after they went down, a waitress brought a pot of turtle soup and two bowls over. When the appetizing aroma wafted over, Qing Shui took in a deep breath. After all, the culinary skills of the great chef in Yu He’s kitchen, were many times better compared to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Smells good, it doesn’t lose out to the black fish.” Yu He spoke, as she filled the bowls with the soup, passing one to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui slowly savored the taste, and as the soup trickled down his throat, he felt an indescribable feeling of satisfaction. It was akin to a man dying of dehydration, drinking his first mouthful of water. It was the same for Yu He as well. The two of them locked gazes, with faces full of smiles. Who didn’t like good food, let alone good food with such a high nutritional value that was able to nourish the body.</p>
  <p>“Wouldn’t it be a waste if we sold this to the public?” Yu He spoke, filled with unwillingness.</p>
  <p>“Silly girl, although we don’t have a lot of it, but it’s still more than what we can eat. No matter what, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to eat till you are satisfied.” Qing Shui laughed upon hearing the reply of Yu He.</p>
  <p>“Stop acting mature, you are not allowed to say that I’m a silly girl!” Yu He humorously added. What a strange feeling it was, when a man 10 years younger than her, scolding her for being a silly girl.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, what do you mean by acting mature. I’m a mature man.”</p>
  <p>Yu He immediately ignored the statement, and continued drinking her soup. After the pot of turtle soup was finished, she asked again. “Such a delicious soup, how should we sell it?” Yu He asked, bewildered, as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Such a good soup, just a single bowl can enable a man to do the deed 3 to 5 times in a single night without question, and it has no other side effects to the body.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose, as he seriously replied Yu He.</p>
  <p>“You naughty idiot! I’m asking you a serious question about the pricing of the soup, and yet you replied with horny sentences.” Yu He speechlessly pouted.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled cheekily at Yu He, “I’m just saying that this soup is very valuable, and will have a huge market. After all, how many men wouldn’t want to feel like a dragon in bed, satisfying the woman they love.”</p>
  <p>“If you continue talking like that, I shall ignore you!” Yu He didn’t know how to continue facing Qing Shui who loved taking advantage of her with his words.</p>
  <p>“Okay okay, I won’t continue talking like that. Get the kitchens to prepare a huge pot of turtle soup, and sell at 10 taels of silver per bowl. As for the name, we will call it the All Aspect Nourishment Soup!</p>
  <p>“Won’t 10 taels of silver be too expensive?”</p>
  <p>“Expensive? From the start, the things we sell have always been luxury goods. Those aristocrats can afford to spend a few hundred to a thousand taels of silver in one night at a brothel. Imagine this, if they come and drink our soup before slaughtering their way to the brothel. I think they would be more than willing to pay these 10 taels of silver.”</p>
  <p>“You mischievous kid……”</p>
  <p>“I have a limited supply of soup, while there are many wealthy men out there. I can guarantee that once they have tried this, they will flock here everyday. After all, their young and beautiful wives are in their homes waiting for them to give them happiness.”</p>
  <p>“Ouch!</p>
  <p>“Argh! I’m sorry, I was wrong!” Qing Shui was knocked down accidentally by Yu He on the sofa. She was pinching Qing Shui, while Qing Shui let out a cry of pain, as Yu He panicked and accidentally fell down on Qing Shui. Not only that, but she could feel that a certain area of his anatomy had transformed into something as hard as steel.</p>
  <p>“Don’t blame me, this is the effect from the All Aspect Nourishment Soup! Look how fast the effects are.” Qing Shui laughed as Yu He picked herself up in a fluster.</p>
  <p>Yu He, “……”</p>
  <p>The final decision, was that Yu He Inn would only sell two huge pots of turtle soup per day. Qing Shui hurriedly left after that. He couldn’t stand it when Yu He looked at him with those eyes filled with a hidden grudge.</p>
  <p>Before he left, Yu He handed a banknote worth 30,000 taels of silver over to Qing Shui. These were the proceeds from the sale of the black fish for the month he had been away.</p>
  <p>Adding to the earlier proceeds, he had a total of about 40,000 taels of silver now. Now, Qing Shui felt that money wasn’t so tough to earn after all. To ordinary folks, they would be unable to earn 40,000 taels of silver over their entire lives; to wealthy, 40,000 taels of silver was like peanuts, used to pay for hiring a ravishing escort to accompany you for the night.</p>
  <p>Seeing that it was still in the afternoon, Qing Shui decided to visit Wenren Wu-shuang!</p>
  <p>“I wonder how will she react when she realizes that I’ve reached the Xiantian realm. She made me a promise that so long as I stepped into the Xiantian realm within 10 years, she would allow me to pursue her.” Qing Shui kept smiling as he recalled the words of Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>The Night Fragrant Court had long treated Qing Shui as one of their bosses. Thus, Qing Shui easily accessed the 4th level, arriving at the place where the two beautiful guards were guarding the entrance to the peak level of Night Fragrance Court.</p>
  <p>“Should we stop him?” The petite female guard on the right asked the busty female guard on the left.<br></p>
  <p>“Little miss has commanded before that he can enter and exit freely.” The busty guard unblinkingly replied.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>“But little miss……”</p>
  <p>“Xin Ran, listen to elder sister, I’m never wrong!” The busty female guard exclaimed with confidence as she turn her head and regarded the petite guard with exquisite features.</p>
  <p>As the two guards stepped aside, Qing Shui knew that both Wu-gou and Wu-shuang were inside, as he smiled and lightly nodded his head to the guards before pushing open the door to enter.</p>
  <p>The main hall was as grand as before. Now that it was summer, shimmers of heat could be seen rising from the surface of the pool. As for the hot springs, there wasn’t anyone in there. Pausing his steps, he cocked his head to listen. Qing Shui decided to walk to the back of the artificial mountain, as he heard some commotion coming from over there.</p>
  <p>The footsteps of Qing Shui made no sound, as he wanted to give them a surprise. Qing Shui snuck up and appeared at the back of the artificial mountains. Following which, a scene occurred that left him stunned.</p>
  <p>“Ahh! Ahh! Get out!!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui dashed out immediately with his hand covering his nose. He felt a massive nosebleed. Wuren Wu-gou and Wenren Wu-shuang were actually bathing together. In Qing Shui’s mind, he could only see their perfect jade bodies. And this was not the most critical point. The critical point was that Wenren Wu-Shuang was actually bending over, while Wenren Wu-Gou was in front of her, as she washed her back for her. That snow-white, perfect round ass was directly facing Qing Shui, at such a close distance! The water pond was literally just behind the fake mountains… Wu-shuang’s most private place was staring him right in the eye!</p>
  <p>The stimulus that caused the nosebleed was none other than the posture of Wu-shuang! Such a celestial beauty like her, actually adopted such a position…</p>
  <p>The Wenren sisters never expected someone to be here. After all there were guards stationed outside, and in addition Wenren Wu-shuang was at the Xiantian realm. She should be able to detect it if people tried to sneak up on her.</p>
  <p>To think that someone actually successfully sneaked in. Not only that, but that someone actually saw them in such an embarrassing position. Initially, Wenren Wu-shuang was angered. But upon discovering that it was Qing Shui, Wenren Wu-shuang panicked and screamed at him to get out.</p>
  <p>Before Qing Shui ran out, he actually still turned around to feast his eyes upon the mature buxom figure of Wenren Wu-gou. A pair of beautiful sisters, Qing Shui felt that his luck today was really good…</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was already starting to fantasize what it would be like if he were the one standing behind Wu-shuang, washing her back in that position. That feeling…</p>
  <p>As their footsteps rang out, Qing Shui immediately kept the lusty thoughts of his under lock and key. Embarrassedly, he stared at the two girls. The Wenren sisters had already clothed themselves fully, but despite that, their hair still emitted an unmistakable fragrance.</p>
  <p>“You’ve already taken advantage of my sister Wu-shuang. Why have you returned?” Wenren Wu-gou recovered herself quickly, as she laughed flirtatiously, as though the peek at her body by Qing Shui hadn’t happened at all.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui awkwardly stood there. He didn’t know that Wenren Wu-gou actually knew of the things that happened when he was treating the poison for Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>“I just came back this afternoon, are both of you fine?” Despite her act, Qing Shui could still see a tinge of redness on the visage of Wu-gou.</p>
  <p>“Of course we are fine, hehe, but there’s someone who kept mentioning you to me.”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-gou laughed as she departed, “I shall leave you two to chat. Anyway, little fellow, thank you for curing Wu-shuang earlier!”</p>
  <p>“No need for thanks, it’s what I should have done. I’m more than happy to do it.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he regarded Wenren Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>After Wu-gou left, “Thank you for your clear-wind fruits.” Wenren Wu-shuang had recovered from her embarrassment somewhat, as she took the took the initiative to start the conversation.</p>
  <p>“Is your body still fine? Are there any adverse reactions after the treatment?”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang felt a bit weird chatting about her body in front of Qing Shui. But still, she nodded her head, “I’m alright now. I didn’t expect that you were actually an alchemist. You are getting more and more mysterious to me. I can’t see through you at all.”</p>
  <p>“Hehe, anyway, I didn’t see you for a month. I felt that our sword skills must have grown rusty. Let’s go, I shall accompany you in training!” Qing Shui suggested.</p>
  <p>———————–</p>
  <p>“How is this possible?” The sword in Wu-shuang’s hand was sent flying after a single strike by Qing Shui.</p>

 <p>“Such a good soup, just a single bowl can enable a man to do the deed 3 to 5 times in a single night without question, and it has no other side effects to the body.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose, as he seriously replied Yu He.</p>
 <p>“You naughty idiot! I’m asking you a serious question about the pricing of the soup, and yet you replied with horny sentences.” Yu He speechlessly pouted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled cheekily at Yu He, “I’m just saying that this soup is very valuable, and will have a huge market. After all, how many men wouldn’t want to feel like a dragon in bed, satisfying the woman they love.”</p>
 <p>“If you continue talking like that, I shall ignore you!” Yu He didn’t know how to continue facing Qing Shui who loved taking advantage of her with his words.</p>
 <p>“Okay okay, I won’t continue talking like that. Get the kitchens to prepare a huge pot of turtle soup, and sell at 10 taels of silver per bowl. As for the name, we will call it the All Aspect Nourishment Soup!</p>
 <p>“Won’t 10 taels of silver be too expensive?”</p>
 <p>“Expensive? From the start, the things we sell have always been luxury goods. Those aristocrats can afford to spend a few hundred to a thousand taels of silver in one night at a brothel. Imagine this, if they come and drink our soup before slaughtering their way to the brothel. I think they would be more than willing to pay these 10 taels of silver.”</p>
 <p>“You mischievous kid……”</p>
 <p>“I have a limited supply of soup, while there are many wealthy men out there. I can guarantee that once they have tried this, they will flock here everyday. After all, their young and beautiful wives are in their homes waiting for them to give them happiness.”</p>
 <p>“Ouch!</p>
 <p>“Argh! I’m sorry, I was wrong!” Qing Shui was knocked down accidentally by Yu He on the sofa. She was pinching Qing Shui, while Qing Shui let out a cry of pain, as Yu He panicked and accidentally fell down on Qing Shui. Not only that, but she could feel that a certain area of his anatomy had transformed into something as hard as steel.</p>
 <p>“Don’t blame me, this is the effect from the All Aspect Nourishment Soup! Look how fast the effects are.” Qing Shui laughed as Yu He picked herself up in a fluster.</p>
 <p>Yu He, “……”</p>
 <p>The final decision, was that Yu He Inn would only sell two huge pots of turtle soup per day. Qing Shui hurriedly left after that. He couldn’t stand it when Yu He looked at him with those eyes filled with a hidden grudge.</p>
 <p>Before he left, Yu He handed a banknote worth 30,000 taels of silver over to Qing Shui. These were the proceeds from the sale of the black fish for the month he had been away.</p>
 <p>Adding to the earlier proceeds, he had a total of about 40,000 taels of silver now. Now, Qing Shui felt that money wasn’t so tough to earn after all. To ordinary folks, they would be unable to earn 40,000 taels of silver over their entire lives; to wealthy, 40,000 taels of silver was like peanuts, used to pay for hiring a ravishing escort to accompany you for the night.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was still in the afternoon, Qing Shui decided to visit Wenren Wu-shuang!</p>
 <p>“I wonder how will she react when she realizes that I’ve reached the Xiantian realm. She made me a promise that so long as I stepped into the Xiantian realm within 10 years, she would allow me to pursue her.” Qing Shui kept smiling as he recalled the words of Wu-shuang.</p>
 <p>The Night Fragrant Court had long treated Qing Shui as one of their bosses. Thus, Qing Shui easily accessed the 4th level, arriving at the place where the two beautiful guards were guarding the entrance to the peak level of Night Fragrance Court.</p>
 <p>“Should we stop him?” The petite female guard on the right asked the busty female guard on the left.<br></p>
 <p>“Little miss has commanded before that he can enter and exit freely.” The busty guard unblinkingly replied.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“But little miss……”</p>
 <p>“Xin Ran, listen to elder sister, I’m never wrong!” The busty female guard exclaimed with confidence as she turn her head and regarded the petite guard with exquisite features.</p>
 <p>As the two guards stepped aside, Qing Shui knew that both Wu-gou and Wu-shuang were inside, as he smiled and lightly nodded his head to the guards before pushing open the door to enter.</p>
 <p>The main hall was as grand as before. Now that it was summer, shimmers of heat could be seen rising from the surface of the pool. As for the hot springs, there wasn’t anyone in there. Pausing his steps, he cocked his head to listen. Qing Shui decided to walk to the back of the artificial mountain, as he heard some commotion coming from over there.</p>
 <p>The footsteps of Qing Shui made no sound, as he wanted to give them a surprise. Qing Shui snuck up and appeared at the back of the artificial mountains. Following which, a scene occurred that left him stunned.</p>
 <p>“Ahh! Ahh! Get out!!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dashed out immediately with his hand covering his nose. He felt a massive nosebleed. Wuren Wu-gou and Wenren Wu-shuang were actually bathing together. In Qing Shui’s mind, he could only see their perfect jade bodies. And this was not the most critical point. The critical point was that Wenren Wu-Shuang was actually bending over, while Wenren Wu-Gou was in front of her, as she washed her back for her. That snow-white, perfect round ass was directly facing Qing Shui, at such a close distance! The water pond was literally just behind the fake mountains… Wu-shuang’s most private place was staring him right in the eye!</p>
 <p>The stimulus that caused the nosebleed was none other than the posture of Wu-shuang! Such a celestial beauty like her, actually adopted such a position…</p>
 <p>The Wenren sisters never expected someone to be here. After all there were guards stationed outside, and in addition Wenren Wu-shuang was at the Xiantian realm. She should be able to detect it if people tried to sneak up on her.</p>
 <p>To think that someone actually successfully sneaked in. Not only that, but that someone actually saw them in such an embarrassing position. Initially, Wenren Wu-shuang was angered. But upon discovering that it was Qing Shui, Wenren Wu-shuang panicked and screamed at him to get out.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui ran out, he actually still turned around to feast his eyes upon the mature buxom figure of Wenren Wu-gou. A pair of beautiful sisters, Qing Shui felt that his luck today was really good…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already starting to fantasize what it would be like if he were the one standing behind Wu-shuang, washing her back in that position. That feeling…</p>
 <p>As their footsteps rang out, Qing Shui immediately kept the lusty thoughts of his under lock and key. Embarrassedly, he stared at the two girls. The Wenren sisters had already clothed themselves fully, but despite that, their hair still emitted an unmistakable fragrance.</p>
 <p>“You’ve already taken advantage of my sister Wu-shuang. Why have you returned?” Wenren Wu-gou recovered herself quickly, as she laughed flirtatiously, as though the peek at her body by Qing Shui hadn’t happened at all.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui awkwardly stood there. He didn’t know that Wenren Wu-gou actually knew of the things that happened when he was treating the poison for Wu-shuang.</p>
 <p>“I just came back this afternoon, are both of you fine?” Despite her act, Qing Shui could still see a tinge of redness on the visage of Wu-gou.</p>
 <p>“Of course we are fine, hehe, but there’s someone who kept mentioning you to me.”</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-gou laughed as she departed, “I shall leave you two to chat. Anyway, little fellow, thank you for curing Wu-shuang earlier!”</p>
 <p>“No need for thanks, it’s what I should have done. I’m more than happy to do it.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he regarded Wenren Wu-shuang.</p>
 <p>After Wu-gou left, “Thank you for your clear-wind fruits.” Wenren Wu-shuang had recovered from her embarrassment somewhat, as she took the took the initiative to start the conversation.</p>
 <p>“Is your body still fine? Are there any adverse reactions after the treatment?”</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang felt a bit weird chatting about her body in front of Qing Shui. But still, she nodded her head, “I’m alright now. I didn’t expect that you were actually an alchemist. You are getting more and more mysterious to me. I can’t see through you at all.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, anyway, I didn’t see you for a month. I felt that our sword skills must have grown rusty. Let’s go, I shall accompany you in training!” Qing Shui suggested.</p>
 <p>———————–</p>
 <p>“How is this possible?” The sword in Wu-shuang’s hand was sent flying after a single strike by Qing Shui.</p>
