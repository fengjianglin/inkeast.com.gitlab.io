 <p><strong>AST 1376 - Qing Shui's Peak Martial Emperor Demonic Beast, A Sect With A Long History, the Divine Beast Sect</strong></p>
 <p>Zhao Yaowu left and Qing Shui didn't feel anything about it but just took a walk around the manor with the two ladies. There weren't many people here to begin with. Including Zhao Yaowu, there was only just over ten people, with one person in-charge of the cleaning up of a building. Since there was no one staying in the place, the cleaning wasn't done once a day. Qing Shui had no idea if the reduction in staff was Zhao Yaowu's wishes or if it was a decision by the Tianhe Clan. It was impossible for ten people to clean up the entirety of the ten buildings once through daily.</p>
 <p>It could be because Qing Shui's earlier action had stunned some people that three of the maids left, quitting the job. Qing Shui wouldn't force them to stay either. He knew that the people who had stayed here would definitely be people who were on quite good terms with Zhao Yaowu.</p>
 <p>There were still five or six of them left. Qing Shui wasn't bothered to say anything to them. If they wished to stay, Qing Shui wouldn't be against it. If he couldn't even deal with maids, then how would he be able to set up the Imperial Cuisine Hall?</p>
 <p>The interiors of the pavilion buildings were still quite clean with not much dust. The wooden floor was so clean that it could reflect a person's image. The place at which Zhao Yaowu and the maids stayed wasn't within these ten pavilion buildings but no one knew if Zhao Yaowu and the others had stayed here before.</p>
 <p>The facilities in the courtyard weren't bad. There was even a place that catered to young children's entertainment. There were artificial mountains, ponds, flowers and trees. There was nothing to complain about the environment. They just chose the place they would be staying in the pavilion buildings at the back.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, then what shall we do now?" Yehuang Guwu watched as Qing Shui helped put Sister Yuan Su's bed in the room. All the other furniture was readily available and was all brand new. The bed was the only thing which the two ladies insisted on having replaced.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had many things on backup in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. There was sufficient space in there for him to store things and thus he had a variety of things and quite a number of them. There were no exceptions for beds, blankets and things like that.</p>
 <p>These were things that the two ladies had chosen to put in for use on while traveling.</p>
 <p>"Let's go take a look at the building on the extreme end. We'll be setting up the Imperial Cuisine Hall there in the future, so let's go and see if there's anything we need to prepare." Qing Shui gave it some thought. Even if he didn't set up the Imperial Cuisine Hall now, he would still need a general plan so that everything would be ready for the operation.</p>
 <p>At the point of construction, this building had been intended to be used as a trade association or something similar. Therefore, the structure was of a higher quality than Yehuang City's Imperial Cuisine Hall. At the very least, Qing Shui felt that it was of a much higher quality than Soulsearch's Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>The building was also very tall. They went up to the tenth story. Each story was about ten meters or so and thus this entire building had a height of 100 meters. Generally, in a prosperous city, a height like this wasn't considered to be short. Of course, there were even higher ones, with even some which exceeded 1,000 meters. However, those buildings tend to be located in forests. They were immense structures and were a form of symbol.</p>
 <p>Heading upward from the lowest story, they just continued to take a look. This manor that Tianhe Renmo had given them was extremely suitable. There was basically nothing that they had to prepare. All the facilities were already available.</p>
 <p>Of course, as for shelves, counters and things like that, Qing Shui had quite a number of them in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He just needed to bring them out.</p>
 <p>The corridors and stairs here were built in a circular winding fashion and there was also a spot which allowed one to head upward or downward directly. However, it was located at the back. In the front, one could only take the winding stairs or choose to fly up into the hall of each story directly.</p>
 <p>However, a method like this would generally be stopped by the owner of the building.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui decided to put his residence on the highest level of this building and also left a room for the two ladies. Earlier, they had already cleaned up a room for them to stay in temporarily. Of course, they could stay in whichever room they chose to in this manor.</p>
 <p>The day passed by without any troubles. They spent the entire day in the manor. Qing Shui was like a small and nameless pebble, tossed into the great sea of the continent's capital, not creating even the slightest ripple.</p>
 <p>"We've been traveling for such a long time, the two of you should have an early rest. We'll go take a look around the continent's capital tomorrow," Qing Shui looked toward the two ladies and said.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, then I'll go and take a rest. The two of you have an early rest too!" Yuan Su smiled and left first.</p>
 <p>"Wait for me! Qing Shui, you should have an early rest too!" Yehuang Guwu said to Qing Shui and ran after Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>On the way, Qing Shui had plenty of sex with Yehuang Guwu but it was generally in the middle of the night. Qing Shui would use the Sacred Jade Divine Stone to send them to a very far place before they then headed back. Yuan Su had discovered that on two occasions. After all, what could the two of them be up too in the middle of the night...</p>
 <p>After the two ladies went back, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal directly. He put in the Five Elements Spring of Life in the bathtub in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and started to have a soak.</p>
 <p>This was the sixth time he was soaking in this after he had attained a breakthrough to the eighth heavenly layer. It could be because the time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was very much longer than the outside world that he would soak once in awhile. The effect was especially good.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's foundations were very firm and his internal organs were very powerful as well. The same went for his muscles and bones. However, there was still rooms for improvement. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to have a soak like this once in awhile. He had also let the people around him try it out before but there weren't any effects.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had basically finished the Four-Yang Pills before he attained the breakthrough. Therefore, he could only place his attention on the Five-Yang Pills now. It was a pity that the medicinal herbs right now were still insufficient for him to refine the Five-Yang Pills.</p>
 <p>He reckoned that he still needed some time. After reaching this degree, the herbs should only be a little off from the required years. Moreover, there were also the effects of the Spiritual Medicinal Beasts and the Flower of Life.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, Qing Shui hadn't forgotten about his demonic beasts. Although he hadn't gotten his hands on powerful medicinal pills, the speed at which they were getting stronger was still very, very fast. This was the power of blood awakening. The demonic beasts' legacies were much more powerful than that of a human's.</p>
 <p>The size of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was a lot larger now. Even if Qing Shui could see it often, he still felt that both its power and size had increased by a lot.</p>
 <p>His physical strength had reached 80 sun...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly read on. He was full of anticipation to see if the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's Dragon Elephant Force had any changes.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Force: Passive battle technique, permanently increases physical strength by 80 times!</p>
 <p>Having this increased by ten more times, Qing Shui was very happy. It was good as long as there was some kind of improvement.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness: Increases random attacks by three times for a maximum of 50 targets.</p>
 <p>There was no change to the attack numbers but the attacking prowess had increased by a lot. Qing Shui was already very satisfied. He didn't have high expectations for this battle technique.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp, at the great perfection stage. It increased physical attacks to be ten times as strong and there was a certain chance for the surrounding targets' limbs to appear numb and render them unable to move.</p>
 <p>Its prowess had increased once again...</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion: Instantly leap across a distance within 3,000 meters!</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi: Instantly spew out Core Qi to attack the opponent and harbors powerful killing prowess. It can decrease the target's speed by 20% for a period of 2 hours.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons: After technique is performed, multiple targets within a 1,000 meter range would have their strength reduced by 10%. The number of targets cannot exceed 50 and the duration of the effects could last for 2 hours!</p>
 <p>There were no changes to these three battle techniques, they weren't out of Qing Shui's expectations.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack: Launches an attack at one target in an instant. Can raise offensive power by fifteen fold!</p>
 <p>From the initial ten fold to the current fifteen fold... Qing Shui already felt that the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was able to become a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast. Its battle technique legacies were far too domineering.</p>
 <p>Dark Infernal Flames: Dark Infernal Flames under the feet allows the Dragon Elephant’s attack to possess a 20% armor breaking offensive power. At the same time, it increases the Dragon Elephant’s speed in the skies by two fold.</p>
 <p>Dragon Scale Armor: Allows Dragon Elephant’s defense to increase by four times. Having a powerful physical body and attacks were the foundation to the Dragon Elephant's greatest abilities.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the last one, Qing Shui smiled happily.</p>
 <p>The last Dragon Scale Armor was an especially important ability. To increase by four times would mean that it would be his physical strength multiplied by five. With this, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack could already reach 480,000 sun in power...</p>
 <p>Demonic beasts were different from humans. They didn't have to undergo False God Tribulations and could directly attain a breakthrough past its bottleneck and enter the False God realm directly, becoming a demonic beast of the immortal demons level.</p>
 <p>Immortal demons would have a strength of 600,000 sun or 700,000 sun. As long as their strength surpassed one million sun, then the demonic beast would become a immortal demon directly.</p>
 <p>Compared to humans, demonic beasts were more blissful in this aspect. However, due to the effect of spiritual intelligence, it was very hard for demonic beasts to attain the level of immortal demons. This was in a way, a balance of the Heavenly Dao. Demonic beast's spiritual intelligence were lower and thus wouldn't experience False God Tribulations.</p>
 <p>Earlier on, Qing Shui had already reached his maximum capacity and thus didn't refine the additional power. Therefore, he waited until he attained a breakthrough to the eighth heavenly layer. When he first attained a breakthrough, his foundations weren't that stable, thus he hadn't been able to absorb the additional power until now. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's physical strength had increased by 35 sun and when reflected on Qing Shui, it was seven sun.</p>
 <p>Right now, with a physical strength of 200 sun, seven sun was nothing to Qing Shui. However, it was still an increase. It was just that the increase wasn't considered a lot when looking at his overall power.</p>
 <p>Having a little increase was better than not having an increase at all. Qing Shui didn't know when it started that the reflection from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was already 20% of its increment in its physical strength. Was this a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast and in the future, it might not lose out to Qing Shui. If the increment continued to be at 20%... thinking about the seven-colored pellet and the paragon vessel, Qing Shui shook his head. The current state might be the best.</p>
 <p>The abilities of the Fire Bird, the Thunderous Beast and the Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider were all also increasing at a rapid rate. Although they weren't comparable to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, they weren't that far off. The Fire Bird and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant were progressing at a similar rate while the Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider was slightly slowly. However, it was already many times stronger than it was in the past. Right now, it was also showing some signs of going to attain a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Amongst the four beasts, the Thunderous Beast as the weakest. However, it had the strongest control and to Qing Shui, it would mean that he could work together with the Thunderous Beast to achieve an instant kill with a single move.</p>
 <p>Right now, if he didn't encounter any False Gods, Qing Shui would be able to deal with his opponents just with these four demonic beasts. Furthermore, he could do so even if he was up against multiple Peak Martial Emperor cultivators. Qing Shui was very happy. He then thought of the Divine Beast Sect.</p>
 <p>The Divine Beast Sect was in the continent's capital and was one of the top few powerful sects, a sect with a long history and ancient legacy. They had a powerful means of taming beasts. This place was very close to the point at which the three continents intersected. There were many demonic beasts there of varying power. Therefore, as long as one had the path of beast taming, one would be able to tame their own beasts. Therefore, the power of the Divine Beast Sect in the continent's capital was very strong. A False God from the Divine Beast Sect could even go up against ten or more False God cultivators from elsewhere. If they were lucky, the tamed beasts would be one grade more powerful than its owner or could be even stronger. This was how terrifying the Divine Beast Sect was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know what level the pair of genius brothers had reached. With the Heart of Demonic Beasts, they could tame demonic beasts which were much more powerful than themselves and they could also gain the abilities their demonic beasts had. He had no idea if they had attained False God. Both Yehuang Guwu and himself had already reached False God level now.</p>
