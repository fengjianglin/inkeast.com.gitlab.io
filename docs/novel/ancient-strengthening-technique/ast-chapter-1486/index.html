 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was able to understand this man. In his past life—and even in the World of Nine Continents—he had frequently heard of this sort of thing: homicide by quackery. This man must have been a victim. When Qing Shui listened to what the man had to say, he decided to help him. In other words, he treated it as the consultation fee for the small building he wanted to buy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then take us to her. I still believe in my medical skills.” Qing Shui smiled and gestured the man to lead the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on their conversation, Qing Shui was now aware that the patient was this man’s wife. When they reached the second floor, an intense odor of medicinal herbs penetrated through the air. Qing Shui said as he walked upstairs, “Sister-in-law, take a whiff of the herbal odor and get a general idea of the type of sickness.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Fei was surprised and smiled with a nod. They continued to climb the stairs slowly. After a while, she began to speak calmly, “These medicinal herbs contain Ding Leaf, Zhili Herb, Transparent Grass… this must be kidney failure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man leading in front turned his head toward Ling Fei for a while before he turned around and continued to move forward. Qing Shui could tell that she must have gotten it right after seeing the man’s reaction towards her. He smiled and said, “That should be it. Moreover, it is possible that it’s already at the last stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t a doctor in his past life, so he wasn’t quite clear about the situation and progression of kidney failure. He had yet to see kidney failure in this world too. He was, however, able to tell what it was based on the medicinal herbs that were being used to restrain the failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they stepped into the room, the odor of the medicinal herbs became more intense. The room was quite neat and simple. There was a woman laying on top of a clean bed. She seemed to be slightly out of shape, as her whole body was swollen. When she saw the man, she shook her head and said, “Lang Xuan, I’ve told you already that you don’t have to look for another physician. It’s futile.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s voice was a bit hoarse. There was a hint of reluctance towards leaving this world in her voice, as well that of leaving this man behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ya Qian, don’t give up. There are still many good physicians. These people are Miraculous Physicians, so there’s considerable hope that they can cure you.” At that moment, the man put a warm smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Qing Shui’s past life, there were countless terminal illnesses. Kidney failure wasn’t considered terminal, but the patient would need to have a kidney transplant, and only close family members would have a high chance of providing a suitable replacement kidney. However, kidney transplants weren’t recommended in the World of Nine Continents. This world had no terminal illnesses, only incompetent physicians, which was why there were no illnesses one should fear, as long as he was able to find an impressive physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this illness required kidney transplant in his past life, then it would be difficult to cure the illness in this world too. Ordinary physicians would not be able to cure it. Qing Shui had already examined the situation for a while. Not only did this woman have kidney failure, the functions of her liver and spleen were halfway to failing as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would be difficult to treat one who had lost the function and self ability to heal himself, because he would not be able to absorb any sort of medicinal pills when consumed. Elixirs and miraculous medicines would be useless as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister-in-law, is there a way to treat her?” Qing Shui wanted to look at Ling Fei’s abilities in action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think there is. But it will take at least a week to do so.” Ling Fei considered the situation for a moment before she gave her reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kidney failure could be categorized into acute kidney failure and chronic kidney failure. There would be fast progression with acute kidney failure, normally due to insufficient blood supply to the kidney. This may be caused by external wounds or burns, or by certain factors that blocked this supply, causing the patient to receive damage or harm from poison without fail. This would create acute kidney failure as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main reason for chronic kidney failure to occur would be long-term pathological changes in the kidney. With the illness progressing with time, the function of the kidneys would slowly deteriorate, causing the kidneys to fail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it?” The man did not shrink from his woman and asked Qing Shui directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You said it before. It was the incompetent physician who caused the harm, but I can only tell you that the reason for this illness is because she had been poisoned.” Qing Shui said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was shocked. His expression twitched for a moment before he let out a long sigh, “I beg the two Miraculous Physicians to save my wife.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment, this man seemed to aged much more than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a man from a big family, yet he didn’t expect that he hadn’t been able to evade being followed after escaping to this place. Since he couldn’t escape, then he had decided that he would not run any longer. He would go back - this was what they had forced him to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would be the one to do it this time. He didn’t want to use too much time, so he decided to use the Force of Rebirth on this woman. Doing so would quickly evoke the power of the kidneys and use the generation of five elements to promote their vitality. Qing Shui’s medical skills were astonishing and miraculous as the woman’s swollen body was shrunk within half a day. Her pale complexion had been repainted with a bit of tenderness and rosy color. Her eyes were not as dull as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She seemed much more like a graceful noblewoman than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was the man named Lang Xuan shocked, he was pleasantly surprised as well. Yin Tong and Ling Fei were also amazed by the result. Even though both of them were already aware of Qing Shui’s medical skills, they actually thought that his medical skills weren’t that superb. However, they now knew that they had been grievously mistaken about their beliefs in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped and said, “Luckily, I did not fail. But I will need to treat her once more after three days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. I am sorry for before. I shouldn’t have doubted you all.” The man offered his sincere apologies to the three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is nothing. I would have done the same if I were you. We understand your situation.” Qing Shui said respectfully. After all, it was because of the incompetent physician that the best time for his loved one to seek medical help had been forgone. It would be hard for him not to become infuriated due to that reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am really thankful to you. This house is yours and this is your new house property certificate. I have obtained a strange thing from somewhere once. This thing is neither gold nor silver. I did find someone to appraise this, and he said that only a destined person would be able to use it. I don’t know whether you are that person or not, but I will give it to you! There are some medicinal herbs that I have collected inside too. They are considered decent still.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man handed an Interspatial Silk Sachet to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a look inside and was shocked. The medicinal herbs inside were all at least 8000 years old. It seemed like he had collected these for the sake of his woman. Furthermore, there were some tokens inside, which were the house property certificates he had mentioned earlier. There was also a piece of black rock that looked like a loom shuttle. It was approximately a foot in size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised beyond explanation because this was a Shadowless Flying Shuttle. Like the Heaven Shaking Drum and Spirit Gathering Lamp, this was one of those things that Qing Shui had been searching for which could increase the speed of a demonic beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shadowless Flying Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I’ll not hesitate to accept this.” Qing Shui smiled and took the Interspatial Silk Sachet before tossing it into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In any case, you have saved Ya Qian. I will treat you all as our savior. If there’s a chance for us to meet again, I will give you another gift.” The man said in an earnest tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui noted the serious expression on the man’s face, and that he had an important matter to settle first. His woman had been poisoned by someone. Moreover, Qing Shui was also able to feel a shred of aura from the man. From that, he knew that this man was quite powerful. Despite so, his strength had somehow been restrained by half.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your body has problems too. I will unravel your inner body the day after tomorrow, after your wife gets better. You have to trust me.” Qing Shui excused himself after he finished talking. Since he still needed three days of time, then they would wait as they were told to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man continued to send off the three of them toward the door. He watched Qing Shui’s silhouette disappear towards the horizon wistfully before turning back into the house. When he went back to the room, he said with a happy smile on his face, “We have truly met our savior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. If there’s a chance in the future, we have to express our gratitude to them properly. Unfortunately, for now, we don’t know how to thank them yet. We don’t have anything to give them either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, it was Qing Shui’s medical skill that saved her, and both of them knew that common items would never please him! Before Qing Shui had left, he had told the man something. The man said, “The thing that I had given was already considered the most valuable item for him. Did he mean that rock? Was it destined to be for him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister-in-law, do you know how to refine medicines?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Fei shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will keep the medicinal herbs that the man gave earlier for refining medicines then. When I’m done, I will divide some of the medicinal pills for you.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have regarded me as a stranger. There is no need to be like this. Even though we haven’t been acquainted for a long time, I have a very good vibe of us as a group. Perhaps little brother doesn’t appreciate the both of us.” Ling Fei sneered as she looked at Qing Shui. She had a sly expression on her face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My mistake. Let’s go home. It’s already late. We have to watch the eldest daughter of Xue Clan in the martial arts fight tomorrow.” Qing Shui said happily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After going back to the inn, they ate a bit of food and then went back to their respective rooms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, on the other hand, immediately went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he quickly took out the Shadowless Flying Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With one look at the object, Qing Shui was stunned. This item did not require quenching and it did not require an upgrade. This was a special kind of treasure, just like the Arhat Rosary Beads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Permanent increase to the speed of demonic beasts summoned by twofold. A passive treasure without the requirement of cultivation. Zero energy consumption, a master must be recognized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Status: No master recognized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To recognize a master: Drip one hundred drops of blood essence on the Shadowless Flying Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One hundred drops of blood essence. Qing Shui’s expression twitched. There was no choice but to drip it out then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could still afford to drip one hundred drops of blood essence, but he would require a hundred days to make a full recovery. He would have to spend the time inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to recover himself. If it was just a few drops of blood, then it wouldn’t matter too much. An ordinary person would be gravely ill if they were to release even a single drop of blood essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood essence wasn’t essence nor blood. It was a thing more mystical than bone marrow, and it was an essential component of a human being. Each person would not have much of it in their body. However, the stronger a person was, the more blood essence he would possess. In any case, releasing a hundred drops of blood essence would save Qing Shui a long time in quenching the shuttle. With that in mind, he happily changed into his night clothes quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After dropping his blood essence, Qing Shui finally stopped, a pale complexion on his face. The Shadowless Flying Shuttle had turned from pitch black to a jade green color as it emitted an aura like the sensation of a breeze. It was quite ethereal. A master had been successfully recognized.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the most amount of blood essence he had ever released. It was extremely terrifying. It was also exhausting even for Qing Shui. After a while, he went into deep sleep. This sleep went on for another half month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt better once he woke up again. However, his body was still extremely weak. There was nothing he could do but wait for his body to recover slowly. It would be useless to eat the Vital Essence Pill at this exact moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With nothing to do, Qing Shui placed the Shadowless Flying Shuttle on the stone platform. There was a wide display of Qing Shui’s other treasures too, like the Spirit Gathering Lamp, Coiled Dragon Statue, Heaven Shaking Drum, Spirit Channeling Jade, Demon Binding Ropes, Soulshake Bell...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then called out the Dragon Slaying Beast and Hell Nightmare Beast, as well as his other demonic beasts. Afterwards, he tried to sense their speeds, which had indeed been doubled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a permanent increase to the demonic beasts’ overall speeds. Even though Qing Shui knew this would be the result, he was still indescribably ecstatic. The battle power of the demonic beasts had been greatly increased. It should be known that speed was considered power, especially for the Dragon Slaying Beast and Hell Nightmare Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the other demonic beasts would greatly increase too. Their survivability had doubled, or increased by an even greater extent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the next day, when Qing Shui awoke, he had completely recovered. After all, the time in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was long. Qing Shui began his recuperation two months later. He had a lot of precious medicinal pills, so it wasn’t strange that he had completely recovered from losing his blood essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inn was quite lively today. Everyone was talking about the fight that the eldest daughter of Xue Clan had set up on Yulang Street. It was late in the morning after he finished his breakfast. There was already fewer people in the inn around this time, as they were already heading towards the arena. As mentioned before, it was already quite late in the morning.</span></p>
