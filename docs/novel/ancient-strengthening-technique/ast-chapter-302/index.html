 <p><strong>Chapter 302 Evening Primrose, the Stone Monument of a Frenzied Bull.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 302 - Evening Primrose, the Stone Monument of a Frenzied Bull</strong></p>
  <p><span style>The very next day, Qing Shui was doing his morning exercise at the public square as usual. This time he was practising his taichi fist, facing east where the sun naturally rose.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui couldn’t hear any discussion now. He smiled, there was no changes in his fists. This must be the effect of the two golden lotus flowers from the Blue Lotus Art cultivation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly Qing Shui spiritually sensed that he was being watched . Ever since his Blue Lotus Art transformed and the golden lotus flowers had manifested, he could feel that his Spiritual Sense had grown tremendously from these past few days’ practise.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The power of Spiritual Sense and Spirit Energy were directed related to each other!</span></p>
  <p><span style>He could gradually feel that the person was approaching him. But he pretended that there was no one and continued to be immersed in his own world.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Congratulations on being the Chief Disciple!” a &nbsp;melodious and charming voice familiar to Qing Shui rang out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He slowly opened his eyes. His clear eyes locked onto Gongsun Jianwu. If being a Chief Disciple meant that he could have “everything” that satisfied him, Qing Shui would not hesitate to take this absolute beauty right in front of him. After all, there were so many beauties and he couldn’t possibly have each and every one he met. If they were irrelevant to him, why bother giving them pleasure?</span></p>
  <p><span style>She wasn’t Canghai Mingyue or Huoyun Liu-Li, not the Goddess Master or Wenren Wu-Shuang either and not even Zhu Qing, Mingyue Gelou or Shi Qing Zhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I am not the Chief Disciple and I have no interest to be this Chief Disciple.” Qing Shui was neither cold nor happy about it. He just calmly stated it. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Gongsun Jianwu felt very pained in her heart. When she left yesterday, she had really considered not talking to this cold man ever again. But then the more she kept thinking this way, the more Qing Shui’s figure kept appearing in her mind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Women were weird. But actually all humans were this weird, &nbsp;especially women like Gongsun Jianwu. Qing Shui’s disinterest in her made her feel that he was different from the rest. Perhaps it was the environment that she was brought up in. Her talents and her strong personality made her indecisively come here again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, can’t we talk normally?” Gongsun Jianwu looked at Qing Shui, feeling a little hurt. But she didn’t want to leave like she did last time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You like me?” he suddenly looked at her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I didn’t……”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Since you came to find me, I’ll tell you this - you and I are not suited for each other. I am only interested in you due to your background and social circles. To me, you are just like a new toy to a child. As soon as I am bored with you, I’ll just abandon you at some corner.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I……”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I admit that you are very beautiful and sexy. And I am also very sexually interested in you.” Qing Shui continued bluntly with a laugh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gongsun Jianwu looked at him, flabbergasted at his bizarre attitude. The last few words were especially ambiguous. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“How about it? Come to my room tonight and we can have fun together. We can do it in the bathroom, on the sofa, table, chair, bed. Let’s try some challenging positions. Don’t worry, I have no problem with my stamina. I’m sure I can satisfy you and let you taste the bliss of being a woman,” with a smile and his gentle tone, Qing Shui uttered words that bewildered Gongsun Jianwu.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You bastard……” tears welled up in Gongsun Jianwu’s eyes as she spat angrily at Qing Shui with a red face. Then she ran away without turning her head around again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stared after her sexily perky and soft delicate ass until she was gone from his sight. The way they swayed was so seductive that it could make one nosebleed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is she even a woman? She can’t even endure a few words. Judging by her reaction and pride, I guess it’s not easy for a man to climb on her bed.” Qing Shui thought back at his words that made her fled in embarrassment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gongsun Jianwu only calmed down after running a distance. Actually she already knew that Qing Shui had purposely said those words to anger her as soon as she took the first few steps. But she was still mortified.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment Qing Shui had already arrived at Cang Wuya’s place. He felt a little excited because Fei Wuji would be bringing a lot of medicinal herbs for him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The two girls were not here today. They barely learnt how to handle the Heavenly Thunder Slash so Fei Wuji gave them half a month’s time to practise it on their own time. If there were any doubts to be cleared up, they could ask him. It was the same for Qing Shui too, except that he was here to get his medicinal herbs today.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Autumn was over and it was beginning of winter. The afternoon sun shone brightly and warmed the big field, lifting everyone’s mood.</span></p>
  <p><span style>By the time he rushed over there, Fei Wuji had already arrived to give him the medicinal herbs. Qing Shui saw that there were quite many brocade boxes of different sizes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were also some in the flower pots. The unhealthy looking ones in some of the pots seemed like they would wither anytime.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Have a look, Qing Shui. Are these what you need?” Fei Wuji pointed to about 2,000 brocade boxes that were about one feet long and one inch high in front of him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui saw Evening Primrose, Viola Tricolor, Japanese Cudweed Herb, Bay Leaves, Dysosma Leaves, Scandent Schefflera in the flower pots…………</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yes, Qing Shui saw White Frost Nectar. He had a hunch that it was collected from the mountains behind them. Seemed like it was also known as White Frost Nectar in the world of the nine continents. Perhaps Gongsun Jianwu didn’t recognise it the other day because she wasn’t an alchemist.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Thank you Martial Uncle, thank you Old Man!” Qing Shui sincerely thanked them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No need to thank us, we are family,” Fei Wuji smiled generously. The warmth in his tone made people feel even happier.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui gathered them in a beast leather pouch while the rest of the flower pots were brought back to his own residence with a one-horned ox carriage before transporting them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He broke the flower pots directly on a separate plot of land to plant them. He started with those withering herbs first and then watered them with the water from the pond.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Finishing all this quickly, Qing Shui breathed a sigh of relief. After all, these were all insurances for his pill creations in the future. Only by having these insurance could he increase his chances of breaking through the 5th heavenly layer.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He was only confident it setting off to the Yan Clan if he broke through the 5th heavenly layer. Or else even if he had gone to them, he wouldn’t achieve what he wanted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He opened the brocade boxes. Each of them had labels on them - 1,000 year Lingzhi, 1,000 year Fleeceflower Root, Bear Gall, 1,000 year Tiger Bone Powder, 1,000 year Bear Gall, 1,000 year Ox Gallstones……...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui realised that there were more than a hundred for each one of them. This made him very grateful to Cang Wuya’s thoughtfulness. He was very afraid of failing. If he was given too little and couldn’t succeed even once, it would be embarrassing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui took a look at every box again and began to separate them by categories. After all, these were all for enhancing his ability so he actually wanted to synthesize them soon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Evening Primrose!” Qing Shui thought that his eyes were playing tricks on him. He looked at it twice in excitement but still saw that it was Evening Primrose. He opened the box and saw the exact thing that was in his mind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Haha, this will take care of the Five Dragon Pellet!” Qing Shui couldn’t describe his feelings at this very moment. It was an extremely pleasant surprise. He didn’t expect to have the Evening Primrose in his hands so soon. He was even planning to search for it after visiting the Central Continent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Effects of Five Dragon Pellet: Removal of all negative ailments in an instant, especially poison, spirit damage and hallucinations from drugs - complete dispel! Aside from internal injuries and fatal wounds, it had the ability to heal external wounds within a short amount of time. Slightly improves the physique of the user. If the user didn’t die instantly after sustaining heavy damage, consuming the Five Dragon Pellet could prolong their survival.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had been drooling about this pellet, especially knowing that it could completely dispel the effects of poison, spirit damage and hallucinations from drugs. Although it couldn’t heal fatal wounds, it could delay death for a day and it was imperative to know that many things could happen change within a day.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The main ingredients of the Five Dragon Pellet were the 1,000 year Snow Lotus, 1000 year Ginseng and Evening Primrose…….. His preparations would have been completed if it wasn’t for the missing Evening Primrose.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was great! Searching through all the brocade boxes, Qing Shui was happy to discover another stalk of Evening Primrose. What nearly made him cry in happiness was that there was a bunch of dried seeds on the stalk……...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal after arranging all the medicinal herbs. He was prepared to synthesize all the items he could synthesize tonight in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Not practising alchemy for such a long time made Qing Shui feel a little excited about the prospects of it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was only almost noon. Qing Shui walked alone on the stone path of the Heavenly Palace in boredom and slowly calmed down.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He then realised that it had been awhile since he last had some free time to walk around leisurely like this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He slowly walked towards the stone monument region. Qing Shui estimated that one afternoon should be enough for him to observe at least one stone monument. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The stone monument right after the one with Tiger inscription had a Bull on it; a rushing bull. Among the bulls on the continent, mythical bulls existed too.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The bull on the drawing had a large head and shiny black body. It was muscular and had a beard. On top of those blood red eyes, it had a sharp horn on its head. There was a lion escaping in front of the rushing bull.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was a stone monument of a frenzied bull!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Bulls were usually tame beasts. However when it was in a frenzy, even the lion had to avoid it. That strong body, explosive violent qi stance and the curves of its tense body……...</span></p>
  <p><span style>Everything formed a meridian chart in Qing Shui’s eyes; a meridian chart in the exact moment of a bull in a violent frenzy. The enormous amount of strength and blood circulating could bring out more physical power than a body was capable of usually. This was the same for the qi stance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When a tame bull met a lion, they could only be eaten or escape from them. However when it was sent into a frenzy, every hit or even a light step could injure or kill a lion. Lions would not only be forced to run, but flee in panic if chased by the bull!</span></p>

 <p><span style>Gongsun Jianwu only calmed down after running a distance. Actually she already knew that Qing Shui had purposely said those words to anger her as soon as she took the first few steps. But she was still mortified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment Qing Shui had already arrived at Cang Wuya’s place. He felt a little excited because Fei Wuji would be bringing a lot of medicinal herbs for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls were not here today. They barely learnt how to handle the Heavenly Thunder Slash so Fei Wuji gave them half a month’s time to practise it on their own time. If there were any doubts to be cleared up, they could ask him. It was the same for Qing Shui too, except that he was here to get his medicinal herbs today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Autumn was over and it was beginning of winter. The afternoon sun shone brightly and warmed the big field, lifting everyone’s mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he rushed over there, Fei Wuji had already arrived to give him the medicinal herbs. Qing Shui saw that there were quite many brocade boxes of different sizes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were also some in the flower pots. The unhealthy looking ones in some of the pots seemed like they would wither anytime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have a look, Qing Shui. Are these what you need?” Fei Wuji pointed to about 2,000 brocade boxes that were about one feet long and one inch high in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui saw Evening Primrose, Viola Tricolor, Japanese Cudweed Herb, Bay Leaves, Dysosma Leaves, Scandent Schefflera in the flower pots…………</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, Qing Shui saw White Frost Nectar. He had a hunch that it was collected from the mountains behind them. Seemed like it was also known as White Frost Nectar in the world of the nine continents. Perhaps Gongsun Jianwu didn’t recognise it the other day because she wasn’t an alchemist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you Martial Uncle, thank you Old Man!” Qing Shui sincerely thanked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to thank us, we are family,” Fei Wuji smiled generously. The warmth in his tone made people feel even happier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui gathered them in a beast leather pouch while the rest of the flower pots were brought back to his own residence with a one-horned ox carriage before transporting them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He broke the flower pots directly on a separate plot of land to plant them. He started with those withering herbs first and then watered them with the water from the pond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finishing all this quickly, Qing Shui breathed a sigh of relief. After all, these were all insurances for his pill creations in the future. Only by having these insurance could he increase his chances of breaking through the 5th heavenly layer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was only confident it setting off to the Yan Clan if he broke through the 5th heavenly layer. Or else even if he had gone to them, he wouldn’t achieve what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened the brocade boxes. Each of them had labels on them - 1,000 year Lingzhi, 1,000 year Fleeceflower Root, Bear Gall, 1,000 year Tiger Bone Powder, 1,000 year Bear Gall, 1,000 year Ox Gallstones……...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui realised that there were more than a hundred for each one of them. This made him very grateful to Cang Wuya’s thoughtfulness. He was very afraid of failing. If he was given too little and couldn’t succeed even once, it would be embarrassing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui took a look at every box again and began to separate them by categories. After all, these were all for enhancing his ability so he actually wanted to synthesize them soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Evening Primrose!” Qing Shui thought that his eyes were playing tricks on him. He looked at it twice in excitement but still saw that it was Evening Primrose. He opened the box and saw the exact thing that was in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, this will take care of the Five Dragon Pellet!” Qing Shui couldn’t describe his feelings at this very moment. It was an extremely pleasant surprise. He didn’t expect to have the Evening Primrose in his hands so soon. He was even planning to search for it after visiting the Central Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effects of Five Dragon Pellet: Removal of all negative ailments in an instant, especially poison, spirit damage and hallucinations from drugs - complete dispel! Aside from internal injuries and fatal wounds, it had the ability to heal external wounds within a short amount of time. Slightly improves the physique of the user. If the user didn’t die instantly after sustaining heavy damage, consuming the Five Dragon Pellet could prolong their survival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had been drooling about this pellet, especially knowing that it could completely dispel the effects of poison, spirit damage and hallucinations from drugs. Although it couldn’t heal fatal wounds, it could delay death for a day and it was imperative to know that many things could happen change within a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main ingredients of the Five Dragon Pellet were the 1,000 year Snow Lotus, 1000 year Ginseng and Evening Primrose…….. His preparations would have been completed if it wasn’t for the missing Evening Primrose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was great! Searching through all the brocade boxes, Qing Shui was happy to discover another stalk of Evening Primrose. What nearly made him cry in happiness was that there was a bunch of dried seeds on the stalk……...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal after arranging all the medicinal herbs. He was prepared to synthesize all the items he could synthesize tonight in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Not practising alchemy for such a long time made Qing Shui feel a little excited about the prospects of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was only almost noon. Qing Shui walked alone on the stone path of the Heavenly Palace in boredom and slowly calmed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then realised that it had been awhile since he last had some free time to walk around leisurely like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slowly walked towards the stone monument region. Qing Shui estimated that one afternoon should be enough for him to observe at least one stone monument. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The stone monument right after the one with Tiger inscription had a Bull on it; a rushing bull. Among the bulls on the continent, mythical bulls existed too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bull on the drawing had a large head and shiny black body. It was muscular and had a beard. On top of those blood red eyes, it had a sharp horn on its head. There was a lion escaping in front of the rushing bull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a stone monument of a frenzied bull!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bulls were usually tame beasts. However when it was in a frenzy, even the lion had to avoid it. That strong body, explosive violent qi stance and the curves of its tense body……...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything formed a meridian chart in Qing Shui’s eyes; a meridian chart in the exact moment of a bull in a violent frenzy. The enormous amount of strength and blood circulating could bring out more physical power than a body was capable of usually. This was the same for the qi stance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a tame bull met a lion, they could only be eaten or escape from them. However when it was sent into a frenzy, every hit or even a light step could injure or kill a lion. Lions would not only be forced to run, but flee in panic if chased by the bull!</span></p>
