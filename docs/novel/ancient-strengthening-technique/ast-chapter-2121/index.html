 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head. At this moment, he noticed Nuo Lan’s expression which looked like a smile, but also not like it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Beihuang Yu said persistently, “I won’t quit. It doesn’t matter if you like Nuo Lan, we can fight for her fair and square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Beihuang Yu, “Do you really find that necessary…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Huangyu looked at Qing Shui, speechless expression covering his face, “What’s wrong? Are you thinking that Nuo Lan won’t fall for me? Girls don’t necessarily like men who only know how to fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. To think that he would also have times when he behaved like a scoundrel. When they first met, Qing Shui thought that he was a simple-minded man who had a good heart. But from the way he was speaking now, he might not necessarily be the same as how he looked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For now, I can’t promise you anything. Let’s just go with the flow. What’s yours, will always be yours. You can’t force it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The truth is one must fight for their own destiny even against the heavens. Happiness must be pursued. Sometimes, if you don’t do it, you will end up regretting in the end.” It’s obvious that Beihuang Yu didn’t agree with what Qing Shui had said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui also understood what he meant, in fact, fighting for your own destiny might sometimes determine the outcomes of everything. Qing Shui was only saying the things before from his heart, and it was also a method of retreating first in order to advance further. In addition to that, for the time being, Qing Shui also didn’t know how he could fight for Nuo Lan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he wasn’t just toying around with her. Qing Shui had treated all of his girls seriously. If he liked a woman, he would treat her very well for the entire lifetime. Alas, he was no longer able to give a woman his perfect love, thus, he could only devote his full heart to each of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, let’s stop talking about this and drink some wine. Though I may not be a good man, truthfully speaking, you are the first person who managed to earn my admiration.” Beihuang Yu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hearing your tone, it seems there is someone who you don’t admire from your heart.” Nuo Lan said at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course there is. The young master of Demons Gate for an example. That dude is crazy, plus his age is double mine. Though he may also be young, if I am the same age as him, it’s unknown who will be the stronger one between us. However, I can confirm one thing. If you are at the same age as him, even if I fight together with him, we still won’t be able to beat you.” Beihuang Yu said speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu was unaffected by it. He was also a straightforward person and would say whatever that went into his mind. Sometimes, this was how humans tended to act. Two people, who could be considered love rivals with each other, were also able to become best friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the time being, Qing Shui wasn’t sure if he could be considered friends with Beihuang Yu, but he didn’t repel him. Even though Beihuang Yu might have a high status, and his strength was also formidable, because of how the Divine Palace was related to the Taiyi Immortal Palace, the each shared a good relationship with each other up to a certain extent. At the very least, they could be considered allies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s just drink here. There is no other place better than here.” Qing Shui concluded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, I would have forgotten if you never mentioned about it. People always said that this place has delicious food as well as a Miraculous Physician working here. Since I have been very busy, I never had the time to taste it. Let me confirm whether the rumor is true today! Oh yes, are you really a Miraculous Physician?” Beihuang Yu gave Qing Shui a suspicious look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then can you please prove it to me? I am very curious, considering how formidable your cultivation is, how do you have the time to learn about the way of medicine?” Beihuang Yu asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You aren’t a virgin anymore.” Qing Shui said seriously after observing Beihuang Yu for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit!” That word immediately came out of Beihuang Yu’s mouth. He was shocked speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan shot a grumpy look at the both of them, “Can both of you please act more seriously?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, when it came to the food and wine, no complaints could be made to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. The moment Beihuang Yu put the food into his mouth, he immediately looked at Qing Shui, “Did you prepare all of these?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Precisely.” Qing Shui proudly looked over Beihuang Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I must admit that your cooking skills surpass even your cultivations!” Beihuang Yu said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have always been proud of my cooking. It is indeed because all of my women have tasted my sinful cuisine that they realized their life will become very boring after I left. That’s why each of them made up their mind to marry me.” Qing Shui said as he reminisced the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Beihuang Yu and Nuo Lan stared blankly at Qing Shui. Moving on, Beihuang Yu once again moved his sight onto Nuo Lan who was happily enjoying her meal. Her feelings of enjoyment were written all across her face. Seeing her expression, he finally believed what Qing Shui said, “Brother, I must admit that you are the smarter one. To earn a woman’s heart, you must start from their stomach. I am known by people as the mad cultivator. If I had known, I would have learned to be a chef instead. That way, maybe Nuo Lan would have……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Nuo Lan didn’t know what she should say. Naturally, she was able to tell that the two were joking with each other. She shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, you made the right decisions by cultivating. That’s exactly where your talent is. If you really want to learn cooking, at most, you will only become a third-grade cook. This also requires one to have talent. In fact, it’s even stricter than cultivating.” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this a joke? The young master of Taiyi Immortal Palace learning to cook? This would definitely make everyone drop their jaws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For now, you aren’t just a chef, but a vicious one as well. I can’t help but wonder how many people at my age can beat you. Initially, I thought that this should be a firm victory for me, but I never expected myself to be utterly defeated. Oh yes, that demonic beast of yours is also terrifying, but it needs your cooperation. If the two of you work together, I am sure the opponents will be driven crazy by you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood Beihuang Yu’s words. If he didn’t act in concert with his demonic beasts, Beihuang Yu would get a chance to escape, but if he did, the chance of that happening would immediately drop down to zero. If Qing Shui hadn’t weakened Beihuang Yu, he would definitely be utterly defeated by him, so much that he might not even be able to withstand three blows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu was also aware of it. But the fact was, Qing Shui was indeed that capable. What made him even more upset was, as Qing Shui grew, he would also continue to develop. But if there ever came a time when he fell behind in terms of cultivation, his factor of appeal would directly diminish by half without even looking at Qing Shui’s progress in it. How was this fair?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the future, I will be coming from time to time to take some food back with me.” Beihuang Yu said before he left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are only allowed to do it once a week.” Qing Shui said firmly. Actually, he knew that it would be difficult for Beihuang Yu to come every now and then considering how occupied he was with his cultivations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, don’t hesitate to come to Taiyi Immortal Palace whenever you are free. I can at least treat you some wine.”</span></p>

Believe me when I say that no men would love you more than I do. I will keep waiting for you. I hope that you can really consider me... Little brother, since you already have so many wives, can you please let go of it just this once and spare me?” Beihuang Yu was unwilling to give up. Qing Shui never expected for him to have such a naggy side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Yang Qi is leaking out every night. It is obvious that one woman isn’t enough to satisfy your desire. If you really are a virgin as you said, I can’t say anything but look at you in admiration. Since that was not the case, even though you may not be married yet, I know that you are just like me, or maybe even better. It has been a few years since I last had that kind of pleasuring occasion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems you are also just another pathetic man…” Nuo Lan chimed in. Beihuang Yu was totally speechless this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Beihuang Yu had left, Qing Shui noticed that Nuo Lan was looking at him. This caused him to be quite confused, “Why are you looking at me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I always used to think that you are inferior to me in terms of strength. Who would have expected for you to hide so much of your power? To think that even Beihuang Yu would be beaten by you.” Nuo Lan seemed to want to see through Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He got careless. Frankly speaking, there is quite a huge gap between our strength. I just happen to be able to restrain him.” Qing Shui said casually, a slight grin on his face.</span></p>
