 <p><strong>Chapter 240 Qinghan Ye, Qing Shui’s Abilities Improves Once Again.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 240 – Qinghan Ye, Qing Shui’s Abilities Improves Once Again</strong></p>
  <p>“Because it is too expensive and I don’t have a lot of money.” Qinghan Ye blinked those eyes of hers which would make one’s body go limp all over, as she smiled and said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned, and he smiled bitterly at Qinghan Ye. “If you like it, take it. I won’t ask for a single tael of silver.”</p>
  <p>“Really?” Qinghan Ye looked at Qing Shui in surprise.</p>
  <p>“Of course it’s real. Oh right, didn’t you say you don’t like it?” Qing Shui asked, puzzled. However, Qing Shui did not bother to think why the woman was behaving like this. Sometimes, there was no reason to what women did. She might not even know why even if you were to ask.</p>
  <p>“I don’t like it, because it is so expensive. If I were to like it but don’t have the money for it, wouldn’t I feel worse?” Qinghan Ye grinned and said.</p>
  <p>The two of them chatted happily, appearing like a compatible couple to others. Qinghan Ye’s feminine charms even attracted gazes from many men.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui fell into a daze, looking bitterly to the front. When Qinghan Ye saw Qing Shui’s expression she could not help but lift her head.</p>
  <p>Not far off, Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue chatted happily as they walked over towards their direction. Qing Shui felt extremely awkward, not knowing what he should say, since both of them also knew Qinghan Ye.</p>
  <p>Would they think that he would seduce someone he had treated before?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s started making wild guesses, but something happened which made him feel even more awkward.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li threw Qing Shui a slight glance as if they were looking at strangers, before they turned away and passed him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at Qinghan Ye awkwardly, feeling disappointed. However, he saw a tinge of grief in Huoyun Liu-Li’s eyes, unlike the indifference reflected in Canghai Mingyue’s eyes.</p>
  <p>The majestic lady on top of the Golden Winged Thunder Condor had completely returned. Qing Shui knew that there was no way he could make affectionate jokes with her anymore. Not even a bit.</p>
  <p>They still did not understand him. It was very natural for Canghai Mingyue to treat Qing Shui like this, but Huoyun Liu-Li’s eyes still had a bit of light in them. Could it be that she was blaming him for being a “player”?</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, are they behaving like this because of me? I’ll go explain this to them for you.” After saying this, Qinghan Ye tried to head off to chase the two ladies who were still in sight.</p>
  <p>“It has nothing to do with you. My dear lady, stop adding on to the mess!” Qing Shui quickly stopped Qinghan Ye and smiled bitterly at her.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not notice either, but when he regained his senses, he noticed that he was holding Qinghan Ye’s little hand. The tender feeling was very nice.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye was suddenly pulled by Qing Shui, her little hand covered in warmth. That heartwarming feeling made her heart beat frantically, but she liked this feeling. She was very happy to hear Qing Shui’s words, but did not know why.</p>
  <p>It may be because the presence of Qing Shui’s nameless Duo Cultivation Technique had attracted her. Maybe it could be because Qing Shui had increased her lifespan by a few decades. Of course, one very important reason was also because Qing Shui had injured her on their first meeting.</p>
  <p>Just when Qing Shui was about to release her hand, he suddenly felt that the Duo Cultivation Technique which was activated non-stop had flowed from his arm into Qinghan Ye’s body.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could feel that amazing “energy” flowing into Qinghan Ye’s body. Her body had suddenly trembled as if it was a cold shiver. Yet, it was also like the feeling ladies would experience when they reached the peak during sexual intercourse.</p>
  <p>In just that short moment, the pair of charming eyes on Qinghan Ye’s face were filled with mist, and a red blush covered her face. When Qing Shui fell into a trance when he was looking at that entrancing face, he could feel that Qinghan Ye had fallen into a certain state at the same time.</p>
  <p>That feeling was like a “dream state”, but yet felt very real. In his dream, he was in a pinkish room with Qinghan Ye with a pink colored bed. The whole room was so beautiful that it made one’s blood boil, especially when looking at that seductive bed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had never seen a bed which would give one so much feeling. It was a double bed full of fanciful thoughts, with a thick pink mattress, soft fluffy pink covers and blanket. When laying on it, he felt that he would sink into it completely. It left only a small feeling that would make one think that if there was a beauty on it, it would definitely be a very visually attractive and seductive sight.</p>
  <p>In his dream, Qing Shui was holding Qinghan Ye’s hand while standing next to the bed. Qing Shui looked at the seductive Qinghan Ye in his dreams, especially the expression she gave. In his mind, she was welcoming but yet appearing as if she was reluctant.</p>
  <p>Could this be the actual Qinghan Ye deep in her heart?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt at that moment, the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique had started to circulate very quickly, and Qinghan Ye seemed to be spiritually linked to Qing Shui. Their souls had merged into one. It was as if they were in the same dream, but yet unable to control their own thoughts and only able to feel and observe.</p>
  <p>The next scene made Qing Shui’s throat start to feel parched!</p>
  <p>In the dream, Qinghan Ye gradually removed her outer clothes, as well as her undergarments. Her beautiful and slender figure was completely naked in front of Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>In reality, Qinghan Ye was so embarrassed but yet noticed that she was not able to control herself. She wanted the her in the dream to put on clothes, but realised that her dream self did not react at all.</p>
  <p>The next scene even made her so embarrassed that she felt like dying!</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye in the dream stood naked before Qing Shui, gently but dazely helping Qing Shui to remove his clothes while Qing Shui looked at Qinghan Ye’s snow white skin, and bountiful and sharp soft peaks…</p>
  <p>Her flat abdomen was the perfect snake waist, coupling well with the well-embodied and perky butt. Her slender legs were even more attractive without clothes on.</p>
  <p>In a moment, Qing Shui’s clothes were also fully taken off, but it did not reveal astonishing muscles. Qing Shui’s Ancient Strengthening Technique trained the muscles and bones, as well as the physical body. Qing Shui’s fair skin and toned muscles exuded a perfect glow.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye pulled Qing Shui’s hand and headed to the bed. The two of them faced each other on the bed. In that dream-like space, everything was so beautiful that it would make one swoon.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s heat had reached its limits, and he felt that the flames were going to burn him to ashes soon. The nameless technique and the Ancient Strengthening Technique were frantically circulating in his body.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui moved. He wildly grasped that divinely beautiful body, and his hands clambered up those soft warm peaks that were well-embodied with an astonishing bounce.</p>
  <p>The wild Qing Shui buried his face into those two snow balls, frantically kissing, and sucking onto them.</p>
  <p>How could the feeling be so real? This was Qing Shui’s thoughts, and he knew that it was not real. Therefore, he did not mind having a good time with Qinghan Ye. After all, Qing Shui had not tasted women for some time. Whenever he thought of the times he had enjoyed with Mingyue Gelou, Qing Shui would need to extinguish the flames in him by drowning himself in his cultivation.</p>
  <p>However, he did not expect for the things that happened in his dream to feel exactly the same as reality.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui in the “dream” moved, Qinghan Ye felt a relaxed feeling, but then she was overcome with a flustered and uneasy feeling, as if her whole body was engulfed in flames! </p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p>At that moment, Qing Shui and Qinghan Ye could both clearly feel it, but it was as if they were merely watching an extremely beautiful and live pornographic scene with themselves as the leads. It was useless for them even if they were to close their eyes as the scene had appeared directly in their mind.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye turned and pushed down Qing Shui below her, as she sat on Qing Shui’s waist…That extremely beautiful visual clash and the touch his body was feeling made Qing Shui understood what ecstasy felt like.</p>
  <p>Her beautiful eyes on that extremely seductive face were half squinted, and filled with mist. Her small mouth had a slightly gap. The intoxicating cries once again rang out, which were especially crisp and near his ears.</p>
  <p>It was as if a volcano had found an opening to erupt its lava. Qing Shui started to move, but lost his self-control, and the nameless Duo Cultivation Technique also circulated frantically.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that Qinghan Ye was different from other women. Once he entered her body, he felt a piercing coldness, as well as agonising heat. Although Qinghan Ye’s body was burning in flames, it felt piercingly cold inside. Qing Shui knew that it was the Nine Yin Qi, and most men would be invaded by that Nine Yin Qi. In the best possible case, they would only suffer from paralysis, losing feeling of their lower body. In the worst cases, they may even lose their lives.</p>
  <p>Just when Qing Shui gave a slight shudder, the Qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique immediately circulated the Duo Cultivation Technique. Qing Shui felt relieved from the icy cold Qi and started to feel warm.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye was like a virgin, enjoying the most casual sex as it felt very real in the dream. Moreover, she would not need to experience the pain that most would during their first time.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui grabbed hold of the initiative, trying out each and every posture in Spring Palace Portraits. Moreover, Qing Shui noticed that gradually, Qinghan Ye’s Duo Cultivation Technique had also started to circulate and very quickly merge with Qing Shui’s.</p>
  <p>At that moment, Qinghan Ye was very astonished to know that Qing Shui actually knew the Duo Cultivation Technique and hers could only act as a support…</p>
  <p>She now knew why men and women would indulge uncontrollably in such activities! That tingling sensation went deep into her bones, as if their souls were flying and filled with yearning.</p>
  <p>The feeling in the “dream” was very real, and even those cries were very clear. The two of them had perfect co-ordination with each other, utilizing those poses in turn. Eventually, Qing Shui realized that so long as he thought of a particular posture, they would use that posture…</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye was kneeling on the bed, looking shyly at her own actions. Her snow white round butt perked high up. She turned her head to look at Qing Shui behind her with seductive eyes, as if she was welcoming yet putting up a front of reluctance…</p>
  <p>The time in the dream was as if one day and one night had passed. Qing Shui felt that throughout the whole process, a weird feeling had happened in his body, especially that circulating Ancient Strengthening Technique. In the dream state, Qing Shui broke through to the 89th cycles. When the Duo Cultivation Technique was circulated, Qing Shui felt that the quality of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was greatly raised. The drop which was originally the size of a grape in his Dan Tian was now the size of a walnut. </p>

 <p>In the dream, Qinghan Ye gradually removed her outer clothes, as well as her undergarments. Her beautiful and slender figure was completely naked in front of Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>In reality, Qinghan Ye was so embarrassed but yet noticed that she was not able to control herself. She wanted the her in the dream to put on clothes, but realised that her dream self did not react at all.</p>
 <p>The next scene even made her so embarrassed that she felt like dying!</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye in the dream stood naked before Qing Shui, gently but dazely helping Qing Shui to remove his clothes while Qing Shui looked at Qinghan Ye’s snow white skin, and bountiful and sharp soft peaks…</p>
 <p>Her flat abdomen was the perfect snake waist, coupling well with the well-embodied and perky butt. Her slender legs were even more attractive without clothes on.</p>
 <p>In a moment, Qing Shui’s clothes were also fully taken off, but it did not reveal astonishing muscles. Qing Shui’s Ancient Strengthening Technique trained the muscles and bones, as well as the physical body. Qing Shui’s fair skin and toned muscles exuded a perfect glow.</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye pulled Qing Shui’s hand and headed to the bed. The two of them faced each other on the bed. In that dream-like space, everything was so beautiful that it would make one swoon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heat had reached its limits, and he felt that the flames were going to burn him to ashes soon. The nameless technique and the Ancient Strengthening Technique were frantically circulating in his body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui moved. He wildly grasped that divinely beautiful body, and his hands clambered up those soft warm peaks that were well-embodied with an astonishing bounce.</p>
 <p>The wild Qing Shui buried his face into those two snow balls, frantically kissing, and sucking onto them.</p>
 <p>How could the feeling be so real? This was Qing Shui’s thoughts, and he knew that it was not real. Therefore, he did not mind having a good time with Qinghan Ye. After all, Qing Shui had not tasted women for some time. Whenever he thought of the times he had enjoyed with Mingyue Gelou, Qing Shui would need to extinguish the flames in him by drowning himself in his cultivation.</p>
 <p>However, he did not expect for the things that happened in his dream to feel exactly the same as reality.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui in the “dream” moved, Qinghan Ye felt a relaxed feeling, but then she was overcome with a flustered and uneasy feeling, as if her whole body was engulfed in flames! </p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui and Qinghan Ye could both clearly feel it, but it was as if they were merely watching an extremely beautiful and live pornographic scene with themselves as the leads. It was useless for them even if they were to close their eyes as the scene had appeared directly in their mind.</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye turned and pushed down Qing Shui below her, as she sat on Qing Shui’s waist…That extremely beautiful visual clash and the touch his body was feeling made Qing Shui understood what ecstasy felt like.</p>
 <p>Her beautiful eyes on that extremely seductive face were half squinted, and filled with mist. Her small mouth had a slightly gap. The intoxicating cries once again rang out, which were especially crisp and near his ears.</p>
 <p>It was as if a volcano had found an opening to erupt its lava. Qing Shui started to move, but lost his self-control, and the nameless Duo Cultivation Technique also circulated frantically.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that Qinghan Ye was different from other women. Once he entered her body, he felt a piercing coldness, as well as agonising heat. Although Qinghan Ye’s body was burning in flames, it felt piercingly cold inside. Qing Shui knew that it was the Nine Yin Qi, and most men would be invaded by that Nine Yin Qi. In the best possible case, they would only suffer from paralysis, losing feeling of their lower body. In the worst cases, they may even lose their lives.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui gave a slight shudder, the Qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique immediately circulated the Duo Cultivation Technique. Qing Shui felt relieved from the icy cold Qi and started to feel warm.</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye was like a virgin, enjoying the most casual sex as it felt very real in the dream. Moreover, she would not need to experience the pain that most would during their first time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed hold of the initiative, trying out each and every posture in Spring Palace Portraits. Moreover, Qing Shui noticed that gradually, Qinghan Ye’s Duo Cultivation Technique had also started to circulate and very quickly merge with Qing Shui’s.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qinghan Ye was very astonished to know that Qing Shui actually knew the Duo Cultivation Technique and hers could only act as a support…</p>
 <p>She now knew why men and women would indulge uncontrollably in such activities! That tingling sensation went deep into her bones, as if their souls were flying and filled with yearning.</p>
 <p>The feeling in the “dream” was very real, and even those cries were very clear. The two of them had perfect co-ordination with each other, utilizing those poses in turn. Eventually, Qing Shui realized that so long as he thought of a particular posture, they would use that posture…</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye was kneeling on the bed, looking shyly at her own actions. Her snow white round butt perked high up. She turned her head to look at Qing Shui behind her with seductive eyes, as if she was welcoming yet putting up a front of reluctance…</p>
 <p>The time in the dream was as if one day and one night had passed. Qing Shui felt that throughout the whole process, a weird feeling had happened in his body, especially that circulating Ancient Strengthening Technique. In the dream state, Qing Shui broke through to the 89th cycles. When the Duo Cultivation Technique was circulated, Qing Shui felt that the quality of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was greatly raised. The drop which was originally the size of a grape in his Dan Tian was now the size of a walnut. </p>
