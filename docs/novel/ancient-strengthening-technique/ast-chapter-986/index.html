 <p><strong>AST 986 - Grade Seven State of Immovable as Mountains, Forging Sword</strong></p>
 <p>Phoenix Paradise: When the Fire Bird receives fatal damage, it would have a 30% chance to go through a Firebath Rebirth. A successful rebirth would be like a qualitative transformation and its strength would become twice as strong as before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this last line. It was very tempting. Once the Phoenix Paradise succeeded, it would become twice as strong as before, this should be in reference to the Fire Bird's physical strength. However, it was impossible for him to let the Fire Bird try this skill easily, since the success rate was only 30%. He couldn't begin to imagine what would happen if it failed. A flying beast like the Fire Bird was extremely rare and they had great room for growth and improvement.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider now had a strength of about 600 stars, a lot more than when he had tamed it in the beginning. Back then, it was about the current Fire Bird's level.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider's physical strength had reached 100 stars and the Five Qi Origin could increase its physical strength fivefold!</p>
 <p>Five Qi Origin: Five-Headed Demonic Spider's innate battle technique, permanently increases its physical strength fivefold and has zero depletion.</p>
 <p>Looking at this passive battle technique, Qing Ming thought of how the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Dragon Elephant Force increased its physical strength threefold while the Fire Bird's Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens increased its physical strength fourfold.</p>
 <p>In the past, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird were only able to increase their physical strength onefold. As they became stronger, these abilities also underwent great changes. In the future, these demonic beasts would definitely become even more powerful.</p>
 <p>He then took a look through the Five-Headed Demonic Spider's battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider's all-encompassing web attack which has a powerful corrosive poison and stickiness. This web is so strong that it would be hard to cut through it with blades.</p>
 <p>Poison Silk Entanglement: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider can fire a thread of poison silk. This attack has a range of 500 meters and can be used for attacking and entangling the target. Its speed is also very fast and it was highly toxic and sticky.</p>
 <p>Spider Swarm Attack: The unique ability of a king of demonic beasts. Its strong subjects would be able to attack together with it.</p>
 <p>Flying Spider Silk: After using this, its speed will increase by five times. This skill lasts for 7.5 minutes. It can only be used once a day.</p>
 <p>Sharpness: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s eight legs are incredibly sharp. They carry a high toxicity and penetrating ability.</p>
 <p>Unyielding Shield: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s defense is extremely strong.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider wasn't only suited for long distance battles, but it was suited for close ranged battles as well. Its body was very sturdy and its huge legs were extremely sharp. Therefore, right now, it was still the demonic beast with the strongest damaging prowess. Its instant acceleration, attacking prowess, and venomous nature were all very powerful.</p>
 <p>If a person got struck by the Corrosive Poison Web, even if he didn't die, he would be dealt a great amount of damage. Basically, the person would be done for.</p>
 <p>The Jade Emperor Bee was a Peak Martial Saint with a strength of about one star. It was probably going to be hard for it to attain a breakthrough to the Martial Emperor level. In the future, they would basically be useless in battles. However, the Jade Emperor Queen Bee Nectar was good stuff.</p>
 <p>The Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies had caught up and were now Peak Martial Saints, with a strength a little more than a star. It was a pity that they weren't of much use and could only help to pollinate the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>With the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, these demonic beasts had also grown very quickly. It could be because of their species. Take the Jade Emperor Queen Bee for example, its size made it possible for it to be ridden and it was also strong. However, its endurance level was insufficient.</p>
 <p>Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies were extremely beautiful, but similar to the Jade Emperor Bees, they couldn't be beast rides and right now, they weren't suited for battles either. They could only be a part of the scenic view of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, fluttering about...</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was also a Peak Martial Saint with a strength of two stars. During this period of time, its rate of its growth had accelerated, causing Qing Shui to be filled with some anticipation. In the near future, he planned to try out the Ice Snow Sacred Fruit or medicinal pills to see if its abilities could undergo a one-time tremendous change. It was far too weak. Although it had a venomous poison, it wouldn't be able to handle his future opponents, it would not even be able to withstand a single touch from them.</p>
 <p>Even the Fire Bird and the Five-Headed Demonic Spider must become stronger. They could easily deal with Early Martial Emperors but they wouldn't be able to deal with Peak Grade One Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>Compared to the Jade Emperor Bees, Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies, and Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable, the Thunderous Beast's improvement was huge. This also let Qing Shui heave a sigh of relief. During this period of time, its strength had increased from three stars to the current ten stars.</p>
 <p>Not only had its physical strength increased by quite a bit, but there had also been some changes to its battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Violet Thunder Protection: Unique ability of the Thunderous Beast. It can increase all of its abilities and make them two times stronger. It doesn't depletes energy and automatically circulates. If it received physical attacks, the Thunderous Beast has a chance of inflicting paralysis on its opponent.</p>
 <p>The Violet Thunder Protection had gone through changes when the Thunderous Beast's physical strength had reached ten stars. It previously increased physical strength onefold but now, it increased its physical strength twofold. Although it wasn't comparable to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Dragon Elephant Force, Qing Shui was satisfied. After all, the Thunderous Beast was a long distance control based demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt: Releases an electrifying attack through its core. This attack has a range of 400 meters. This attack has a slight paralyzing effect and has the effect of speed reduction and reaction reduction on the opponents. This effect can be stacked.</p>
 <p>Compared to before, it could now reach 100 meters further than before. Qing Shui realized that watching his demonic beasts' battle technique level up was also an enjoyment. He wasn't as full of anticipation as before, but he was still very happy.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike: Harnesses the core’s power and releases a powerful lightning strike to disable the opponent. It has a 100% chance to paralyze the enemy, with the length of the paralysis depending on the opponent’s abilities. This skill can only be used once every 24 hours.</p>
 <p>The distance from which the Violet Lightning Strike could be unleashed from was almost the same as the Thunderbolt. This was also the skill that Qing Shui felt was the strongest and most monstrous battle technique. In a battle, if used right, it could instantly change the results.</p>
 <p>Lightning Recovery: The Thunderous Beast grew up in the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, harnessing an extremely powerful self-recovery ability. Using Lightning Recovery, the Thunderous Beast can immediately heal half of the injuries on its body. Its natural restoration speed will also increase fivefold for an hour. After two uses, the cooldown time would be two hours.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast's cultivation needed to increase. The combination of the Violet Lightning Strike and his own hidden weapons would create a terrifying existence. Therefore, when Qing Shui saw that the Thunderous Beast had gotten stronger, he was still very happy.</p>
 <p>Recently, he hadn't used his demonic beasts in his battles. He had suddenly gotten a lot stronger and he knew that the demonic beasts wouldn't be of much help either. Therefore, other than using the Fire Bird for travel, he had basically not observed the other demonic beasts much.</p>
 <p>Even for the Fire Bird, he had only sensed its cultivation roughly and it was only this time around that he took a serious look at it. They needed to be powered up. There would be useful for him in the future.</p>
 <p>All in all, Qing Shui was still quite satisfied. Even without medicinal pills, relying on the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, these demonic beasts could become powerful. However, there were only a few of them who could be used in the short term. These were the Fire Bird, Five-Headed Demonic Spider, Diamond Gigantic Elephant, and the Thunderous Beast. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was currently to be kept under review.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's killer move was the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm in his Central Palace's blood pool. He wouldn't use this move easily. For one, it was too evil. Another reason was that he didn't wish to rely on it too much.</p>
 <p>Increasing one's cultivation level was the true way to go. Upon reaching the Martial Emperor level, he knew that this world was very dangerous and that Martial Emperors weren't unrivaled existences. Right now, he still needed to continue to work hard. He wondered when it would be that he no longer craved for power that much.</p>
 <p>Time passed by very quickly and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui opened his eyes and was in a daze for a short moment before he smiled. He had attained a breakthrough. His State of Immovable as Mountains was now at Grade Seven.</p>
 <p>It was now at the same level as Nature Energy. Looking into his body, he saw that the State of Immovable as Mountains Pellet was very agitated. Right now, it increased his body's physical strength by 70%.</p>
 <p>After three months, Qing Shui's physical strength was now at 120 stars and both his State of Immovable as Mountains and Nature Energy were at Grade Seven. When all of them were circulated, his strength approached 600 stars. The Violet Star Thunder God increase his physical strength by three folds, which allowed his cultivation to reach 2,400 stars.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the ‘Raging Blow’, Qing Shui was stunned. Raging Blow was also a type of technique, a domineering one. It was just that he seldom used it, unless it was with the Violet Star Thunder God. It had a high depletion rate and reduced his speed. When the body was under extreme rage, one's strength would increase manyfold, but it would also reduce their speed. However, the 10% speed increment give by the Violet Star Thunder God would more or less make up for the difference.</p>
 <p>Using the Violet Star Thunder God to perform the Raging Blow, his strength would reach over 4,700 stars. Thankfully Raging Blow was a Battle Technique. It would be bad if it was a Auxiliary-type Technique like the Combination Sword Technique. If that were the case, he would only be able to attain a strength of this level at the point of the attack. He would probably not be able to pass by that Ancient Great Formation.</p>
 <p>It was just that although the Raging Blow was a Battle Technique and could be raised to such a level, its prowess could only be shown through a hammer. This made Qing Shui very gloomy. If only he could use it with a sword.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui quickly shook his head and smiled. He should be satisfied. If Raging Blow could be performed with other weapons, it would definitely not be a earth-grade battle technique. It was only because it reduced one's speed and could only be used with a hammer that it became a earth-grade battle technique. Otherwise, it would at least be a legendary-grade battle technique.</p>
 <p>The leveling up of his Art of Forging and the availability of the Violet Star Stone had allowed Qing Shui to forge the Thunder God to become the Violet Star Thunder God it was right now. He had the Thousand Hammer Technique and had swung the hammer tens of millions of time. His mastery of the hammer was already excellent.</p>
 <p>For this period of time, Qing Shui had spent quite a lot of effort on the Raging Blow as well. However, he could only increase its prowess onefold. It should be at either the small success stage or the large success stage, but Qing Shui sensed that there should still be more room for growth. However, it was just that it was extremely tough to level it up.</p>
 <p>With his current abilities, each level up would require a long period of time and effort. He could even be at bottlenecks for an extended period of time.</p>
 <p>His techniques had all reached extremely high grades, just like how the Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains were both at Grade Seven now. It would be very, very difficult for him to bring them up to a higher level. Even he wasn't sure how much more these skills could level up.</p>
 <p>The progress of his Sword of Sixth Wave was also more or less at a standstill. He could already use the Sixth Wave with great ease and mastery. However, he was at a bottleneck for its progress, which made him feel restless.</p>
 <p>It was hard to progress in the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm when it was only at the Sixth Waves. Right now, he was short of a good weapon. Otherwise, the prowess of his Sword of Sixth Wave would definitely be very powerful, and it might not even lose out to the Raging Blow. The dominance of the Wave Essence was not to be doubted.</p>
 <p>"I can reforge the Big Dipper Sword now."</p>
 <p>A hopeful expression appeared on Qing Shui's face. If Qing Shui could forge the Big Dipper Sword well, his abilities would be improved by quite a lot. With another good weapon, there should be amazing effects.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at all things he had prepared. After a round of cultivation, he started forging. He could easily forge weapons that could increase one's strength twofold. Of course, the prerequisite was that the materials were good. However, it was very difficult to forge a weapon that could increase one's strength threefold.</p>
