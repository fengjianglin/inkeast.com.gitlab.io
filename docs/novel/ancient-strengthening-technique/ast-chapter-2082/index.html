 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a look at the situation and felt that Tong Yuan was the scariest of the group. He was the Sword Demon Inheritor, as well as the leader of the bunch. He wasn’t the only Sword Demon, but the most powerful Sword Demons may have been the pinnacle existences of the Demon King’s palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Tu Fu was also an inheritor of the Demon King, the Blood Butcher Demon King’s Inheritor. As for the cold, callous youngster, he was the Arrow Demon’s Inheritor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The appearance of four Demon King Inheritors at once was surprising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui. She also thought that they would be difficult to deal with. Most importantly, Tong Yuan was checking out Shen Huang, and Qing Shui was not happy about that at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We don’t have anything that you want. As for you, don’t get any ideas about my woman. If not I will cut your thing off and make you a eunuch,” said Qing Shui with a smile, as he looked at Tong Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was silent but didn’t object. Even though she knew that Qing Shui was just using it as an excuse, it still made Shen Huang anxious and her heart started beating very fast. The way she looked at Qing Shui was slightly weird as well. The way Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui, exuded tenderness, making Tong Yuan uncomfortable. The woman he fancied was looking at another man tender-heartedly; it was only natural that he felt uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, your woman? Let’s not talk about that. Even if she was indeed your woman, as long as I fancy her, you’d better obediently concede her to me. Furthermore, I am determined to get that Cold Jade Stone Bed. Young man, those who are envied often get hurt. If you don’t want to die you’d better not take the treasure. If it was taken by people without actual strength, it would be like inviting a disaster.” Tong Yuan looked at Qing Shui overbearingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another dumbass, I overestimated you,” hearing Tong Yuan, Qing Shui replied dumbfoundedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s reply also made Tong Yuan dumbfounded. It had been a long time since someone had spoken to him so rudely. Yet to have such an inexperienced and immature rascal call him a dumbass, he was livid, especially taken aback and speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tu Fu laughed, “Tong Yuan, I think the longer we live, the further back in time we go. Being youthful sure is invigorating, to have no fear of anything. If only they knew who we were, then they wouldn’t have the guts to treat us this way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young Arrow Demon was smiling as well, “Today is so interesting. Not only have we found the Cold Jade Stone Bed, but we also found these two amusing people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Shadow Demon remained silent, the Sword Demon seemed like the most powerful combatant out of them all. But in battle, it was difficult to tell who was the most powerful. When death came in an instant, the difference in perceived ability wouldn’t be that great then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you guys just Inheritors of Demon Kings? Do you really think of yourselves as big shots? If you’re sensible, get lost now! Otherwise, you won’t be able to move even if you wanted to later,” said Qing Shui without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the group was shocked as they were looking at Qing Shui. He knew who they were yet still dared to speak like that. It was either he was very strong or he was a fool. Qing Shui didn’t appear to be a fool, could he be secretly gifted?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you? How do you know who we are?” The Butcher was shocked, then shot Qing Shui and Shen Huang a vengeful look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew in one look. Do you feel as though the Northern Blue Domain has no one who can oppose you, so you can do whatever you want? Just wait for the battle to see my power.” Qing Shui smiled as he said it. In a while, his abilities would reach its peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle God Halo and Formations began to boost his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was also looking at Qing Shui with a shocked expression. This rascal had a ludicrous arsenal. Feeling the boost in strength, Shen Huang felt more confident as well. Now her power had reached terrifying levels; she had activated the Flower Storm Strangling Formation. In her hands, she was wielding the gorgeous flower swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went directly for Tu Fu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Yuan and his gang naturally would not be afraid of Qing Shui and Shen Huang. He laughed as he drew an azure longsword. Qing Shui could immediately tell that this weapon was special.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coldfrost!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a very powerful sword; it was an ice-type longsword. However, the vitality of it astonished Qing Shui. Qing Shui immediately knew that he was a formidable opponent. Luckily, Qing Shui’s Nine Yang Physique countered most of the ice-based attributes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come on! You all should attack together!” Qing Shui drew his own Golden Battle Halberd as he mocked them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t exactly trying to goad them since he still hadn’t used his Demonic Beasts. Qing Shui could only have a rough sense of how strong they were. He was unable to have an accurate sense of their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though I know that you’re trying to goad me, I never placed any importance to whatever you said. I individually challenge you to a duel, between masters. I do not want to bully a woman.” Tong Yuan lifted his longsword and stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His one step seemed as though he had stepped past heaven and earth; it was a strange feeling. Qing Shui thought about it. In the world of footwork, it was close to the Eight Trigrams Steps. Moreover, in terms of speed, he was on par with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, then we will first fight one round to the death, what do you think?” Qing Shui grinned as he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Yuan also grinned and nodded, “Just up my alley.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once done, Qing Shui flew off the ground; Tong Yuan was close behind him. He said, “Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">9th Lotus Manifestation Stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine spinning lotuses appeared over Qing Shui’s body. They were all spinning in different directions, creating a terrifying aura of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silhouette of 3 swords appeared around the Sword Demon, all suspended around Tong Yuan’s side, displaying a chilling aura in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was careful. This person’s abilities were far superior to his; he could not afford to continue hiding any of his abilities. Using the Art of Pursuing, he attacked and followed it up with Emperor’s Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Yuan’s speed was reduced by half and his abilities reduced by two folds in just a short while. It was very uncomfortable for him, especially the lack of speed. In a battle, speed was more important than one’s abilities. Without speed, it would be very difficult to hit the opponent. No matter how strong one was, it was useless if you couldn’t hit your target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tong Yuan was not happy about it. By taking a deep breath, his power immediately improved by 2 times, recovering back to his previous state. However, he was still unable to recover his speed. After that, his longsword flew towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sword from the West!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very obvious when a real expert struck. Qing Shui watched as the longsword flew towards him. He suddenly felt that he had nowhere to run. This was its purpose, its advantage. The longsword was coated with a devastating layer of cold air. The air that came into contact with it all got frozen immediately.</span></p>

His Golden Battle Halberd was set ablaze, spitting out bright flames. His Nine Stances of the Ancient Divine Battle Technique merged the strong points of his weapons and sent them to attack.</span></p>

The result was to be expected. His strength was inferior to his opponent. The only thing that could weaken him was the Emperor’s Qi and the Art of Pursuing. The Heavenly Talisman and Vajra Subdues Demons also could do so, but they had little to no effect. The main problem was that his opponent was too strong. Weakening his opponent this way was not as effective as using Emperor’s Qi and the Art of Pursuing. The opponent could easily get rid of the minor effects with some special powers.</span></p>

But he still had his Battle God Halo and Formation. They weren’t absolutely effective against every enemy, but they were still very powerful, especially with Qing Shui’s modifications to the Halo. These things were not able to go through all defenses, but it would do.</span></p>
