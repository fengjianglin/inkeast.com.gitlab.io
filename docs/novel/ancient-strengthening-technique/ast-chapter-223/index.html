  <p><strong>AST 223 – Can you pretend to be my hubby?</strong></p>
  <p>This caused the Canghai couple to be happy as well as worried, especially Canghai. After eating something so amazing that he had never eaten before and drinking the Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine which was loved by both men and women, Canghai was really worried what would happen if Qing Shui were to leave one day.</p>
  <p>So what if he thickened his skin and requested more from Qing Shui before he left? The enjoyable stuff would be finished sooner or later. Now, Canghai regretted that he didn’t thicken his skin enough to ask Qing Shui for the recipe of the Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine. Now his hopes were all on the shoulders of his daughter.</p>
  <p>If Qing Shui really became his son-in-law, not only would his daughter marry a good husband, but also Canghai could enjoy good food every day as well.</p>
  <p>Just seeing the way Canghai behaved made one already guess what this 60 year old man was thinking about. Taking gains and loss with equanimity, he had the attitude of a younger guy. He didn’t want his daughter to miss out on such a good catch that could also make him and his wife happy.</p>
  <p>“Senior, do you know who is the owner of the Greencloud Furniture City?” After they ate, Qing Shui asked Canghai curiously. Qing Shui thought that there was a high probability for the owner to be from the Immortal Sword Sect, Joyous Sect, or the Imperial Beast Aristocrats.</p>
  <p>Canghai wasn’t surprised when he heard Qing Shui’s question. Looking at Qing Shui, he laughed as he replied, “A very powerful person. Qing Shui, you have to know that over in this region, the Immortal Sword Sect, the Joyous Sect, and the Imperial Beasts Aristocrats may appear very powerful, but this is merely on the surface. There are still some very powerful figures that are all alone, and appear extremely ordinary.”</p>
  <p>After hearing the words of Canghai, Qing Shui could deduce that Canghai didn’t even place the Immortal Sword Sect and the rest in his eyes. From Canghai’s words, Qing Shui could gather that there were indeed many powerful experts who chose to live an idle life, appearing to be a an ordinary commoner.</p>
  <p>“If that’s the case, could Senior alert me to some of these very powerful people? In the future, I would take note and avoid them.” Qing Shui casually inquired as he drank his tea.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li both turned their gazes towards Canghai.</p>
  <p>“Let me tell you about those that I know of, but if you want an exact number, I don’t think anyone would know. You never know that the inconspicuous fishmonger you might meet down the street might actually be a peerless expert.” Canghai laughed.<br></p>
  <p>“Around this region, the Sword Tower is an extremely powerful and mysterious existence. The Sword Tower has little people yet they are all extremely strong. The reputation of their sword techniques resound far and wide. However, this organization is really mysterious. They would only open once every two years and set up a test for interested people. As long as there are those that could reached the 9th level, they would be able to obtain a precious treasure.” Canghai replied.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>“Sword Tower? You mean that Nine Level Bamboo Tower?” Canghai Mingyue asked in surprise.</p>
  <p>“Yes, that bamboo tower. However, that bamboo is no ordinary bamboo. Instead, it’s the Purple Heart Bamboo from the Southern Seas, and it’s even stronger than steel.”</p>
  <p>“Senior, why does the Sword Tower organise such tests?” Qing Shui didn’t understand. If you were a powerful sect, there shouldn’t be any problems attracting disciples. However, the Sword Tower did have very little people. Not only that, if you won, they would still gift a precious treasure to you. What exactly were they planning?</p>
  <p>Canghai shook his head, “I don’t know either. Some things are done without any rhyme or reason.”</p>
  <p>“Has Senior tried the test of the Sword Tower before?” QIng Shui felt that this matter was pretty interesting.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, yup. I tried it once about fifty years ago.” Canghai laughed.</p>
  <p>“What level did Senior reach previously?” Qing Shui curiously inquired. Qing Shui wanted to know how strong the Sword Tower exactly was.</p>
  <p>“2nd level.” Canghai replied.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was thunderstruck. 50 years ago. Canghai should, at the very least already, have been at the Xiantian Realm. However, he only reached the 2nd level? How powerful was the Sword Tower exactly?</p>
  <p>“Senior, in these fifty years, you didn’t try again?” Qing Shui continued asking. He really wanted to know how far could he go at Canghai’s level.</p>
  <p>“I went to try again about three years ago. However, I won’t tell you the results.” Canghai smiled.</p>
  <p>“Dad, just tell us. We won’t tell others. I wanna know as well.” Canghai Mingyue hugged one of Canghai’s arms as she pouted.</p>
  <p>“Nope, if I said it, you guys will definitely brush it off as a lie. To save all the trouble, I don’t want my daughter to accuse me of lying.” Canghai laughed as he replied to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“Hmph, daddy is so petty.”</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui didn’t go out but chose to stay alone in his room instead. Qing Shui preferred the solitude and quietness. Only during such moments would he be able to sort out his thoughts and think things through.</p>
  <p>However, before he could get to enjoy the peace and quiet, the two other ladies already made their way into his room. They wanted to drag him out for breakfast and visit the streets. Over the course of these two months, Qing Shui realised that he had gotten extremely familiar with both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, are you planning to challenge the Sword Tower?” Huoyun casually asked after she stepped into the room.</p>
  <p>“Why? Are you worried about me?” Qing Shui snickered. Qing Shui realised it had been too long since he last teased Huoyun. He also realised that in the presence of Canghai Mingyue and her family, Huoyun Liu-Li seemed to be holding her charm back.</p>
  <p>“Who’s worried about you? Go to hell!” Huoyun Liu-Li adorably rolled her eyes at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui discovered that his willpower now was many times stronger compared to the past. Even when seeing the peerless beauty of Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li, he was able to hold his disposition. If it was the past him, he would have definitely already lost control of himself. However, there was still an impulse to rush over to hug them, or to press himself down on their soft bodies.</p>
  <p>No matter what, Qing Shui was someone that had already tasted women before, just like a cat doused with catnip. After knowing the taste of women, Qing Shui kept yearning for that taste again. Speaking of which, it had already been a period of time since he last touched a woman.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, I actually need your help with something. This is why I came to look for you today.” Canghai Mingyue hummed and hawed, as she stated.</p>
  <p>Looking at the behaviour of Canghai Mingyue, Qing Shui was somewhat puzzled. Could she have wanted him to be her doctor? Did she have any illnesses or other medical conditions?</p>
  <p>Bewilderedly, Qing Shui stared at Canghai Mingyue. He stared for quite a long time and even activated his Heavenly Vision Technique. However, to his surprise, Canghai Mingyue was in perfect condition and didn’t seem to have any illnesses or medical conditions.</p>
  <p>“You seem perfectly fine, or is there some awkward spot like your buttocks or some other place that’s uncomfortable? Tell me, we are friends. I will help you, hehehe. I’m not boasting but my medical skills are pretty good.” Qing Shui teased her, trying to lighten up the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>“Go and die, you are crazy. You are talking nonsense…” Canghai Mingyue blushed. Previously, she suppressed herself because she was in front of her parents. Now, she could finally give free rein and didn’t need to suppress her words.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect that the imposing and majestic presence atop the Golden Winged Thunder Condor would actually have such a girlish side to her. This sense of beauty unexpectedly struck him right in his heart.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue inclined her head, as her beautiful black eyes were rimmed with wetness. </p>
  <p>“What do you need? As long as your dad doesn’t force me into a marriage, I’m okay with anything.” Qing Shui continued his teasing.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was stunned, as her heartbeat quickened.</p>
  <p>“Cou…could…you… pretend to be my husband tomorrow?” The volume of Canghai Mingyue’s voice got smaller and smaller, as she quickly turned her gaze below. She did not dare to meet Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt surprise in his heart. Such a peerless beauty akin to an immortal was actually talking to him in such a shy manner. Not only that, her words were also capable of causing one’s imagination to roam about wildly.</p>
  <p>“Pretend? What do you mean by pretend? If you want to, I can be your real hubby!” Qing Shui laughed out loud.</p>
  <p>Maybe it was how relaxed Qing Shui appeared to be that Canghai Mingyue’s awkwardness also disappeared. A woman like her making such a request most definitely meant that she had a reason behind it. Qing Shui didn’t question her reasons but merely agreed in hopes of sharing her burdens.</p>
  <p>“Hmph, be more serious…” Canghai Mingyue scolded.</p>
  <p>“Okay okay, no need to be so nervous. Tell me what you want. I was kidding earlier. Even if your dad wanted to force me into a marriage with you, I will agree too.” Qing Shui replied.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue casted a glance at Qing Shui before replying, “Tomorrow, a bosom friend of my father will be coming over. Not only that, he will bring his son along to propose a marriage engagement with me.”</p>
  <p>“You don’t like him?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p>“Of course I don’t like him.” Canghai Mingyue was speechless.</p>
  <p>“Actually, emotions can slowly be nurtured after marriage…” Qing Shui spoke like a wise man as he nodded his head to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>After a certain amount of silence, Qing Shui broke out laughing, “Okay, I will stop teasing you. Tell me what I should do, how can I help you? Would our pretty Miss here be more gentle to me, and take pity on this little guy here, okay?”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue, “…”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue discovered that she was totally helpless in front of Qing Shui. How many years had it been since someone dared to be so impolite to her? This brat’s mouth dared to say anything.</p>
  <p>Huoyun, at the side, giggled non-stop. She caused Canghai Mingyue to feel even more bashful.</p>
  <p>“Tomorrow, you would pretend to be Sister Mingyue’s hubby. We will just say that both of you are already married. This way, the guy should stop his fantasy.” Huoyun Liu-Li giggled.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue asked Huoyun to be by her side today just so she could say that!</p>
  <p>“Relax, but how should I address you? Mingyue, Yueyue, Beloved Waifu, Honey, Dear…” Qing Shui snickered as his thoughts ran wild.</p>
  <p>The moment Canghai Mingyue heard the words ‘Yueyue’, she was totally unable to show her face. That next sentence of Qing Shui kept resounding in her mind. “Yueyue, let’s go. It’s time for our baby to drink milk!” </p>
  <p>“I don’t care what you address me as, but you better act the part well. You are also not allowed to take advantage of me.” Canghai Mingyue breathed heavily as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Oh, hmm… then there’s gonna be some difficulty. If we don’t appear like a couple, it’s impossible to get the guy to believe, right?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he stated seriously.</p>
  <p>“Then… you are not allowed to be too cheeky.” Canghai Mingyue blushed again as she lowered her head.</p>
  <p>“Yueyue, maybe we should think about how you would address me to make him give up the idea of pursuing you.” Qing Shui added.<br></p>
  <p>“Hmm… Hubby?”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>“Yes? Did Yueyue miss me?” Qing Shui snickered.</p>
  <p>Mist clouded Canghai Mingyue’s eyes as she hurried pulled Huoyun and left the room.</p>
  <p>As they left, Qing Shui bitterly smiled as he stood at the windows, gazing at the departing back views of the two beautiful girls. Who would have thought that Canghai Mingyue would make such a request of him?</p>
  <p>These kind of “harming others but no benefits to oneself” things weren’t things he would do usually. After all, Canghai Mingyue wasn’t his woman. Despite so, they were still friends, and ultimately, he still decided to help her.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui lazed about in his room and finally took out the Ferocious Tiger Departing the Mountains Portrait to hang it up in his room. Qing Shui laid on his bed and meticulously analysed the portrait.</p>
  <p>Although he had already reached the Great Perfection Stage for his Tiger Form, Qing Shui discovered that there were still improvements to be made. Akin to his Deer Cantering Technique, practicing his Tiger Form despite it already being at the Great Perfection Stage would still enable him to gain increments in his attributes. Qing Shui wondered what came after the Great Perfection Stage. Could it be that his Great Perfection Stage wasn’t the real level? Only the stage after his current status could be considered the genuine Great Perfection Stage.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui spent the entire afternoon studying the portrait, as well as the formless aura the tiger in the portrait seemed to emit. He immersed himself in the concept of the painting.</p>
  <p>At night, Qing Shui learnt that the Canghai Couple also agreed to this. After all, they didn’t want to force their daughter. If his bosom buddy really came, Canghai would also find it difficult to reject him. After all, they had a friendship over several decades.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, be careful tomorrow. That little guy is a 8th grade Xiantian expert. He would definitely challenge you. Do you have confidence?” Canghai inquired.</p>
  <p>Upon hearing the words of Canghai, Qing Shui frowned. A 8th grade Xiantian expert was someone on the level of Skysword Sect Sovereign, Gongsun Sanqian. Qing Shui sighed. Why were the friends of Canghai so powerful? Even their descendents had this level of might. All these made Qing Shui even more curious about Canghai.</p>
  <p>“What happens if I injure the guy tomorrow?” Qing Shui smiled in response.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, as long as you don’t kill him, injuries don’t matter.” Canghai sighed.</p>
  <p>This reply caused Qing Shui to be slightly stunned. It seemed that matters weren’t that simple as shown on the surface.</p>
  <p>However, Qing Shui also knew that if his opponent was at the level of Gongsun Sanqian, he wasn’t that worried. After all, he had his hidden weapons, the Big Dipper Sword, and his mastery over the 3rd waves of the Nine Waves Great Golden Palm…</p>

There are still some very powerful figures that are all alone, and appear extremely ordinary.”</p>
 <p>After hearing the words of Canghai, Qing Shui could deduce that Canghai didn’t even place the Immortal Sword Sect and the rest in his eyes. From Canghai’s words, Qing Shui could gather that there were indeed many powerful experts who chose to live an idle life, appearing to be a an ordinary commoner.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, could Senior alert me to some of these very powerful people? In the future, I would take note and avoid them.” Qing Shui casually inquired as he drank his tea.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li both turned their gazes towards Canghai.</p>
 <p>“Let me tell you about those that I know of, but if you want an exact number, I don’t think anyone would know. You never know that the inconspicuous fishmonger you might meet down the street might actually be a peerless expert.” Canghai laughed.<br></p>
 <p>“Around this region, the Sword Tower is an extremely powerful and mysterious existence. The Sword Tower has little people yet they are all extremely strong. The reputation of their sword techniques resound far and wide. However, this organization is really mysterious. They would only open once every two years and set up a test for interested people. As long as there are those that could reached the 9th level, they would be able to obtain a precious treasure.” Canghai replied.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Sword Tower? You mean that Nine Level Bamboo Tower?” Canghai Mingyue asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Yes, that bamboo tower. However, that bamboo is no ordinary bamboo. Instead, it’s the Purple Heart Bamboo from the Southern Seas, and it’s even stronger than steel.”</p>
 <p>“Senior, why does the Sword Tower organise such tests?” Qing Shui didn’t understand. If you were a powerful sect, there shouldn’t be any problems attracting disciples. However, the Sword Tower did have very little people. Not only that, if you won, they would still gift a precious treasure to you. What exactly were they planning?</p>
 <p>Canghai shook his head, “I don’t know either. Some things are done without any rhyme or reason.”</p>
 <p>“Has Senior tried the test of the Sword Tower before?” QIng Shui felt that this matter was pretty interesting.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, yup. I tried it once about fifty years ago.” Canghai laughed.</p>
 <p>“What level did Senior reach previously?” Qing Shui curiously inquired. Qing Shui wanted to know how strong the Sword Tower exactly was.</p>
 <p>“2nd level.” Canghai replied.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was thunderstruck. 50 years ago. Canghai should, at the very least already, have been at the Xiantian Realm. However, he only reached the 2nd level? How powerful was the Sword Tower exactly?</p>
 <p>“Senior, in these fifty years, you didn’t try again?” Qing Shui continued asking. He really wanted to know how far could he go at Canghai’s level.</p>
 <p>“I went to try again about three years ago. However, I won’t tell you the results.” Canghai smiled.</p>
 <p>“Dad, just tell us. We won’t tell others. I wanna know as well.” Canghai Mingyue hugged one of Canghai’s arms as she pouted.</p>
 <p>“Nope, if I said it, you guys will definitely brush it off as a lie. To save all the trouble, I don’t want my daughter to accuse me of lying.” Canghai laughed as he replied to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, daddy is so petty.”</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui didn’t go out but chose to stay alone in his room instead. Qing Shui preferred the solitude and quietness. Only during such moments would he be able to sort out his thoughts and think things through.</p>
 <p>However, before he could get to enjoy the peace and quiet, the two other ladies already made their way into his room. They wanted to drag him out for breakfast and visit the streets. Over the course of these two months, Qing Shui realised that he had gotten extremely familiar with both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you planning to challenge the Sword Tower?” Huoyun casually asked after she stepped into the room.</p>
 <p>“Why? Are you worried about me?” Qing Shui snickered. Qing Shui realised it had been too long since he last teased Huoyun. He also realised that in the presence of Canghai Mingyue and her family, Huoyun Liu-Li seemed to be holding her charm back.</p>
 <p>“Who’s worried about you? Go to hell!” Huoyun Liu-Li adorably rolled her eyes at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui discovered that his willpower now was many times stronger compared to the past. Even when seeing the peerless beauty of Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li, he was able to hold his disposition. If it was the past him, he would have definitely already lost control of himself. However, there was still an impulse to rush over to hug them, or to press himself down on their soft bodies.</p>
 <p>No matter what, Qing Shui was someone that had already tasted women before, just like a cat doused with catnip. After knowing the taste of women, Qing Shui kept yearning for that taste again. Speaking of which, it had already been a period of time since he last touched a woman.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I actually need your help with something. This is why I came to look for you today.” Canghai Mingyue hummed and hawed, as she stated.</p>
 <p>Looking at the behaviour of Canghai Mingyue, Qing Shui was somewhat puzzled. Could she have wanted him to be her doctor? Did she have any illnesses or other medical conditions?</p>
 <p>Bewilderedly, Qing Shui stared at Canghai Mingyue. He stared for quite a long time and even activated his Heavenly Vision Technique. However, to his surprise, Canghai Mingyue was in perfect condition and didn’t seem to have any illnesses or medical conditions.</p>
 <p>“You seem perfectly fine, or is there some awkward spot like your buttocks or some other place that’s uncomfortable? Tell me, we are friends. I will help you, hehehe. I’m not boasting but my medical skills are pretty good.” Qing Shui teased her, trying to lighten up the atmosphere.</p>
 <p>“Go and die, you are crazy. You are talking nonsense…” Canghai Mingyue blushed. Previously, she suppressed herself because she was in front of her parents. Now, she could finally give free rein and didn’t need to suppress her words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect that the imposing and majestic presence atop the Golden Winged Thunder Condor would actually have such a girlish side to her. This sense of beauty unexpectedly struck him right in his heart.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue inclined her head, as her beautiful black eyes were rimmed with wetness. </p>
 <p>“What do you need? As long as your dad doesn’t force me into a marriage, I’m okay with anything.” Qing Shui continued his teasing.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue was stunned, as her heartbeat quickened.</p>
 <p>“Cou…could…you… pretend to be my husband tomorrow?” The volume of Canghai Mingyue’s voice got smaller and smaller, as she quickly turned her gaze below. She did not dare to meet Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt surprise in his heart. Such a peerless beauty akin to an immortal was actually talking to him in such a shy manner. Not only that, her words were also capable of causing one’s imagination to roam about wildly.</p>
 <p>“Pretend? What do you mean by pretend? If you want to, I can be your real hubby!” Qing Shui laughed out loud.</p>
 <p>Maybe it was how relaxed Qing Shui appeared to be that Canghai Mingyue’s awkwardness also disappeared. A woman like her making such a request most definitely meant that she had a reason behind it. Qing Shui didn’t question her reasons but merely agreed in hopes of sharing her burdens.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, be more serious…” Canghai Mingyue scolded.</p>
 <p>“Okay okay, no need to be so nervous. Tell me what you want. I was kidding earlier. Even if your dad wanted to force me into a marriage with you, I will agree too.” Qing Shui replied.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue casted a glance at Qing Shui before replying, “Tomorrow, a bosom friend of my father will be coming over. Not only that, he will bring his son along to propose a marriage engagement with me.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t like him?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Of course I don’t like him.” Canghai Mingyue was speechless.</p>
 <p>“Actually, emotions can slowly be nurtured after marriage…” Qing Shui spoke like a wise man as he nodded his head to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>After a certain amount of silence, Qing Shui broke out laughing, “Okay, I will stop teasing you. Tell me what I should do, how can I help you? Would our pretty Miss here be more gentle to me, and take pity on this little guy here, okay?”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue, “…”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue discovered that she was totally helpless in front of Qing Shui. How many years had it been since someone dared to be so impolite to her? This brat’s mouth dared to say anything.</p>
 <p>Huoyun, at the side, giggled non-stop. She caused Canghai Mingyue to feel even more bashful.</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow, you would pretend to be Sister Mingyue’s hubby. We will just say that both of you are already married. This way, the guy should stop his fantasy.” Huoyun Liu-Li giggled.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue asked Huoyun to be by her side today just so she could say that!</p>
 <p>“Relax, but how should I address you? Mingyue, Yueyue, Beloved Waifu, Honey, Dear…” Qing Shui snickered as his thoughts ran wild.</p>
 <p>The moment Canghai Mingyue heard the words ‘Yueyue’, she was totally unable to show her face. That next sentence of Qing Shui kept resounding in her mind. “Yueyue, let’s go. It’s time for our baby to drink milk!” </p>
 <p>“I don’t care what you address me as, but you better act the part well. You are also not allowed to take advantage of me.” Canghai Mingyue breathed heavily as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Oh, hmm… then there’s gonna be some difficulty. If we don’t appear like a couple, it’s impossible to get the guy to believe, right?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he stated seriously.</p>
 <p>“Then… you are not allowed to be too cheeky.” Canghai Mingyue blushed again as she lowered her head.</p>
 <p>“Yueyue, maybe we should think about how you would address me to make him give up the idea of pursuing you.” Qing Shui added.<br></p>
 <p>“Hmm… Hubby?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Yes? Did Yueyue miss me?” Qing Shui snickered.</p>
 <p>Mist clouded Canghai Mingyue’s eyes as she hurried pulled Huoyun and left the room.</p>
 <p>As they left, Qing Shui bitterly smiled as he stood at the windows, gazing at the departing back views of the two beautiful girls. Who would have thought that Canghai Mingyue would make such a request of him?</p>
 <p>These kind of “harming others but no benefits to oneself” things weren’t things he would do usually. After all, Canghai Mingyue wasn’t his woman. Despite so, they were still friends, and ultimately, he still decided to help her.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui lazed about in his room and finally took out the Ferocious Tiger Departing the Mountains Portrait to hang it up in his room. Qing Shui laid on his bed and meticulously analysed the portrait.</p>
 <p>Although he had already reached the Great Perfection Stage for his Tiger Form, Qing Shui discovered that there were still improvements to be made. Akin to his Deer Cantering Technique, practicing his Tiger Form despite it already being at the Great Perfection Stage would still enable him to gain increments in his attributes. Qing Shui wondered what came after the Great Perfection Stage. Could it be that his Great Perfection Stage wasn’t the real level? Only the stage after his current status could be considered the genuine Great Perfection Stage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spent the entire afternoon studying the portrait, as well as the formless aura the tiger in the portrait seemed to emit. He immersed himself in the concept of the painting.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui learnt that the Canghai Couple also agreed to this. After all, they didn’t want to force their daughter. If his bosom buddy really came, Canghai would also find it difficult to reject him. After all, they had a friendship over several decades.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, be careful tomorrow. That little guy is a 8th grade Xiantian expert. He would definitely challenge you. Do you have confidence?” Canghai inquired.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the words of Canghai, Qing Shui frowned. A 8th grade Xiantian expert was someone on the level of Skysword Sect Sovereign, Gongsun Sanqian. Qing Shui sighed. Why were the friends of Canghai so powerful? Even their descendents had this level of might. All these made Qing Shui even more curious about Canghai.</p>
 <p>“What happens if I injure the guy tomorrow?” Qing Shui smiled in response.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, as long as you don’t kill him, injuries don’t matter.” Canghai sighed.</p>
 <p>This reply caused Qing Shui to be slightly stunned. It seemed that matters weren’t that simple as shown on the surface.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui also knew that if his opponent was at the level of Gongsun Sanqian, he wasn’t that worried. After all, he had his hidden weapons, the Big Dipper Sword, and his mastery over the 3rd waves of the Nine Waves Great Golden Palm…</p>
