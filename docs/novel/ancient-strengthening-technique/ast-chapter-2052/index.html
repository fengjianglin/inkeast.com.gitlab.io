 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're looking for Miraculous Physician Qing!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at them and greeted. "I'm Qing Shui. How may I help you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He already knew that these people were from the Ji Clan. There was also a man whose countenance looked pale and bore a resemblance to the man who spoke. That guy must be going through a lot of turmoil. The pain alone wasn’t something that ordinary people could bear. He could only withstand it by using his power to suppress it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A charming married lady with a poised appearance stood next to him. Her beautiful brows furrowed slightly as she occasionally looked toward the man next to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two slightly young men seemed a little troubled too as they looked at Qing Shui with some doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're here to seek treatment. We’ve heard that Miraculous Physician Qing can cure many different kinds of serious injuries and illnesses." The man in the lead looked at Qing Shui as he was speaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also felt that Qing Shui was too young, resulting in him feeling a little disappointed when he had felt very hopeful to begin with. He felt that this whole trip was a disappointment, after traveling so far to see treatment. They had wanted to come when they heard that there was a Miraculous Physician in the Azure Rainbow City. After all, how amazing could a person in the Azure Rainbow City be? And now that they were here, they realized that it was someone so extremely young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His men didn't want to come, but they also didn't wish to let any chances slip by, and thus made this trip. Even if the man leading was disappointed at the sight of Qing Shui, he didn't show any dissatisfaction. He was very polite and didn't appear dissatisfied or contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, feeling pleased with the way the man had reacted. If it was any other person, they would feel very disappointed in this scenario and show signs of being displeased. After all, they would feel that there wasn't much hope and their attitude would slowly change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Come this way please." Qing Shui got them to enter the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How do I address you?" Qing Shui didn't ask what the medical condition was right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm called Ji Yixun. These are my younger brother Ji Yilie and his wife. The two juniors from our clan went by the names Ji Lang and Ji Nian. " The man in the lead, Ji Yixun, answered forwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already found out what the members of the Ji Clan were called and thus asked casually. The other party didn't hide anything either and even though it wouldn't be much if they were to hide anything, they would appear more sincere when they didn't.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they took a seat, Qing Shui made a pot of tea and poured a cup for each of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being done with the formalities, Qing Shui knew that they couldn’t hold it in anymore. As expected, right after Qing Shui had finished pouring tea for each of them, that married lady said hurriedly, "Miraculous Physician, can you take a look at Yilie? He's in great pain."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui lifted his head to look at the married lady, then at Yilie. He suddenly tapped on Yilie's body a few times at a speed that was so fast that it was blurry. His technique was extremely profound as well, brushing past Yilie’s Sanguan Heaven Acupoint and other parts. Qing Shui's hand almost became invisible during this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Yixun was taken by surprise and almost wanted to stop Qing Shui but he held it in. It took only the time for two breaths before Qing Shui came to a stop. "Are you still in pain?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It’s not painful anymore!" Ji Yilie looked at Qing Shui in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and returned to filling up their teacups. Qing Shui didn't fill up their cups completely earlier, but they didn't drink the tea. After Qing Shui's second time of filling, the cups became almost full and they quickly picked up the cups, appearing a little awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Your condition is a little tricky. The time for the treatment will be a little long. I'll need to take ten days to treat your Dantian, ten days to treat your meridian channels, and then another ten days to help you condition and deal with your illness." Qing Shui drank the tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Yixun shuddered, "Physician, please treat him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That will not be an issue." Qing Shui assured them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui actually knew that there had been some miraculous physicians in this world in the past. Before they took action, they would make things clear, such as getting the other party to help them deal with a matter or to owe them a favor if they were healed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doing this would allow them to build a lot of connections and there would always be people helping them out in all sorts of situations. There had been cases where someone didn't fulfill their promise after receiving the treatment and the miraculous physician got some other influences who had also owed him a favor to do something for him. That favor was to get rid of the influence who had gone back on their words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After something like this had happened, no one would ever dare to go back on their words anymore. Although this miraculous physician didn't have a long life, he had been a prominent existence of his time and many powerful influences didn't dare to offend him. It was because if he was willing, he could cause those great influences to be instantly wiped out. This was the power of a great miraculous physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now felt that he could do the same as well. However, he was still against doing something like this. He hoped that the relationship could be more like between friends. He would be able to find it more acceptable like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui soon found a problem. In his previous life, a doctor would ask for payment for his medical services. However, despite having so many patients, there were very few who could become friends with him. It was impossible to make all the patients his friends. A person with great medical skills probably had countless patients he had treated before and wouldn't recognize all of them. So how could he then become friends with all of them? There might not even be 1 in 10,000 who could become friends with the doctor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Qing Shui believed that the things miraculous physician had done in the past were correct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Before I provide the treatment, let's talk about the remuneration. If you agree, I'll start immediately."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Miraculous Physician Qing, please go ahead and say them!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You guys should be from the Ji Clan, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other party nodded. Since they gave their names, they weren't afraid of being recognized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"People with great power should have great responsibilities. How much I ask from my patients depends on who they are."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're willing to pay regardless of the amount." That married lady quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head. "If I were to treat a poor person, even if the person is about to die, I can do so without asking for anything in return. I can sustain losses to help that person. You can ask around. I'm not doing this for reputation, but for a peace of mind." Qing Shui claimed</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's words made Ji Yixun reveal a look of admiration. There were few people that Ji Yixun respected, let alone a young man like Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"However, when I provide treatment for capable people, I won't ask for money. Instead, you will owe me a favor. In the future, you'll have to do something for me without asking for anything in return. This matter could be something very difficult or it could be something very simple. You might even not be required to do anything for the rest of your life." Qing Shui looked at Ji Yixun and spoke seriously.</span></p>

Will it be something that will send the entire Ji Clan to their deaths?" At that moment, Ji Yilie asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can only say that it won't be something that goes against morals, nor will I ask for your people to sacrifice their lives needlessly. I can't give any other guarantees. I can give you time to consider this. Let me know your answer after you've thought it through." Qing Shui explained and heaved a sigh of relief. He had finally taken the first step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need to consider. I will give you my word!" Ji Yixun said immediately.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, I have the final say. Miraculous Physician Qing, I give you my word." Ji Yixun waved his hand and stopped Ji Yilie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Yixun had the feeling that this young man wasn't someone evil and he believed that Qing Shui could be trusted. This was why he decided to agree to this without any hesitation. If the other party was a physician who harbored evil intentions, he would give it more thought. However, there would be times when even if one knew that the other party harbored evil intentions, he still had to accept the condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he felt very lucky in meeting Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't say much and started the treatment immediately. Qing Shui naturally had no problems in dealing with this case. If Qing Shui were to go all out, he would probably be able to let Ji Yilie completely recover within a week. However, Qing Shui didn't need to waste his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique going all out like that. Therefore, he proceeded with the method he said earlier, one that would take a months' time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, the members of the Ji Clan would have to stay here for a month. This was nothing to them. If Ji Yilie's condition could be treated, they would be willing to stay here, even if it took one year or even ten years.</span></p>
