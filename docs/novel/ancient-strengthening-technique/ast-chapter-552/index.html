 <p><strong>Chapter 552 Hai Dongqing.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 552 - Hai Dongqing</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">A day had past by the time Qing Shui returned from his meeting with Elder Ge. Because of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui often felt that time in reality was very short. Thus, most of the day would have already passed by the time he had a chance to take a breather.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Among the three generations of the Qing Clan, Qing Bei joined the Heavenly Palace. Luan Luan, who was the fourth generation of the Qing Clan, also joined the Heavenly Palace. Mingyue Gelou, Shi Qingzhuang, and Wenren Wu-shuang also joined the Heavenly Palace under the banner of the Starmoon Hall rather the Misty Hall’s.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Jiang and Qing He also joined the Starmoon Hall. The rest of them, including Lin Zhanhan, did not join the Heavenly Palace. They either had yet reach the Xiantian Realm yet or reached the Xiantian realm by means of the Xiantian Golden Pellet. As for Lin Zhanhan, Qing Shui intended for him to protect the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even so, Qing Shui was still worried, therefore Qing Shui intended to raise the strength of the Qing Clan members during this period of time. He wanted to make sure they would have the ability to protect themselves the moment he left Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the second day after arriving at the Heavenly Palace, Qing Shui went down the mountain to find a suitable lot of land or pavilion for sale. Qing Shui was not lacking in money, as he had accumulated many treasures, gold, and silver in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left the Heavenly Palace alone, then went to the lively city of Continent's Capital. Continent's Capital’s roads and pavilions were much wider and taller than those of Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the demonic beasts and horse carriages on the road were of a superior grade. After all, this was the Continent's Capital, the most bustling place of the continent. The transportation, business, sects, and family clans were the most developed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui aimlessly wandered among the crowd, his gaze sweeping the pavilions that lined the two sides. The highest pavilions were ten odd stories high. Although they were not particularly high, the pavilions gave off a sense of magnificence and stability, an extraordinary grandeur.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many of the wealthy stayed in villas. The land area was big, and in it were fake mountains, ponds, forest, pavilions, everything that was needed. One could tell in a glance that these belonged to those family clans or the wealthy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This large road was also one of the most flourishing road, and its name was very poetic as well: Ocean Blue Astral Road. Qing Shui didn’t know the origins of this name, neither was he interested in knowing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Along the way, he saw many which were up for rent. When Qing Shui inquired about them, the other party wasn’t willing to sell. Thus, he did not bother trying to offer a high price. Even if he offered a value twice the market prince, they would not sell. Furthermore, Qing Shui was not that satisfied with these places.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every now and then, he would see a few places for sale but they were too small!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not even bother to go up and ask. He simply looked for others. After all, this was the most bustling area, so much so that even the businesses were good. Along the road, the Cloth shop, weapons shop, banks, pawn shops, armor shops, medicine shops, physician store, and countless many others all seemed to have good business. Thus, there were very few shop lots for sale. They would only sell those lots if they were leaving Continent's Capital.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time slowly went by, and soon, it was noon. Qing Shui felt depressed. He had the money but could not spend it. Could it be that he had to buy his own land and build it himself?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head, he could only buy good land. Actually, with Qing Shui’s status as the Heavenly Palace patriarch, he could get anything he wanted in the Continent's Capital. Qing Shui did not want to did it that way, however, as he detested this way of doing things. What’s more, he had no other use for all his money.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En!” Qing Shui noticed a large sign that made him excited. For Sale! More importantly, this place was big enough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at it and felt that this place was better than he imagined. The location was the best spot of the Ocean Blue Astral Road.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The land area was about as big as Qing Village. In the Greencloud Continent, the price of such a villa would be astronomical, and regular people would not be able to afford such a villa.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Normally, people who owned such a villa would not sell it away. After taking another look, Qing Shui became distracted. This was actually the Hai Clan…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hesitated as he stood there. The was the ancestral home of the Hai Clan. Why was the Hai Clan selling away their ancestral home? Qing Shi felt this matter unimaginable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were a famous Clan in the Greencloud Continent. If anyone said that the Hai Clan was lacking money, they would drown to death from the crowd’s spit. However, it seemed that the Hai Clan was selling away their ancestral home now. Who would do that unless they were lacking money?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that they are leaving? Leaving the Greencloud Continent forever?” Qing Shui speculated. The more he thought about it, the more plausible it became.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taking wide strides, Qing Shui stepped through the wide doors of the Hai Clan. There was not even a guard at guarding the door. As he walked, he thought that it would be great if he bought the Hai Clan’s villa.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui felt that it was not so easy to purchase. Otherwise, this offer wouldn’t have even existed. Upon coming to this train of thought, he smiled. Qing Shui felt that there would be a good show to watch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once he entered, he saw two people chatting with each other. When they saw Qing Shui, they quickly kept quiet. The one on the left side was a youth with thick brows. He smile towards Qing Shui and asked: “Sir, how may I help you?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Isn’t this villa for sale? I wish to buy it!” Qing Shui answered with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man on the other side, a slightly plump man with small eyes, gave Qing Shui a few looks. Perhaps Qing Shui had a certain presence, because after the man looked at him, he said: “Sir, please follow me.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, there were not many people in the Hai Clan. plus, it was cold now. In such a large villa, he did not see many people in it. He followed that plump man with small eyes to the backyard.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The did not see anyone on the way!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They stopped at a gorgeous pavilion, after which the man said: “Young Mistress, there is someone here to buy the house.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Allow him to come in!” An elegant voice with a certain magnetic quality rang out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sir, please!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded his head and walked into the gorgeous pavilion. After he entered, he found himself in a huge hall. This was the architectural style of the World of the Nine Continents. The whole of the first floor was basically the living room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A woman stood in the middle of the living room with a smile on her face. Her figure was tall and graceful; there was an intellectual air to it. Her charm was the kind that could captivate others.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s you!” That intellectual and graceful voice, the stunningly exceptional face… they exuded a certain kind of charm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This women was Hai Dongqing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had met this woman at the Old Ancestor’s funeral before, although this was his first time seeing her face. This woman had a intellectual and gracefully charm, in addition, an exceptional face. Even Qing Shui, who had not planned to take in any more woman, could not help but agree that she was peerless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are selling this place?” Qing Shui smile and retracted his gaze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, are you interested?” Hai Dongqing’s eyebrows relaxed as though she was in a particularly good mood at this moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, yes. I wonder how much are you selling for?” Qing Shui was straight to the point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come, have a seat and we will discuss. Let me get you some tea first!” Hai Dongqing invited Qing Shui to the room, then went to a room north of the living room</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat down and looked at the surroundings here. The decorations were not too luxurious, but it allow people to feel that this was a wealthy family. From the furniture to the decorations they were all of a superior standard and brand new.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the west wall, there was an humongous painting of a snowy land. It was a vast expanse of whiteness and the field of view was extremely expansive. On the extreme left, there were snow-white plum blossoms which stood tall and straight in this snowy heaven, unafraid of the cold. In the middle was a big ice mountain, and on the extreme right, there was a endless glacier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The roof and walls were a light green color. In this hot summer day, it caused Qing Shui to a faint coolness. He felt very comfortable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Hai Dongqing brought out a wooden tray which carried a pot of tea and two snow-white cups. He noticed everything in the room, as well as everything on Hai Dongqing, were all white. He knew then that this woman liked snow-white colors.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sorry for the wait!” Hai Dongqing treaded lightly to across the table.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s fine, sorry to trouble you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing filled the two tea cups to 70 percent, upon which a faint tea fragrance wafted out. Although the tea fragrance was faint, it was very distinct. Any person would feel refreshed upon smelling it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is it very busy being the patriarch of Heavenly Palace?” Hai Dongqing smiled as she offered Qing Shui a cup of tea.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly replied: “Not really, I just came back yesterday. I am still not clear on the Heavenly Palace’s matters.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The working class uses strength, the middle class uses their intelligence, the upper class uses people!” Hai Dongqing smiled as she picked up her cup.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am not as good as you say I am. I just lack time.” Qing Shui shook his head and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing smiled and looked at Qing Shui, that gaze seeming to show that she was especially curious about Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t look at me like that. Curious about me? I’m here to buy the house.” Qing Shui smiled at this beautiful yet stunningly graceful woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing was not embarrassed. Instead, she seemed even happier: “I was quite curious about you. I wonder how you cultivate? You could reach such heights at such a young age. Within the World of the Nine Continents, there would not be many youths who could achieve the same cultivation as you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t do too curious about men, otherwise you might get yourself into a difficult situation. It’s a good thing that I’m young.” Qing Shui did not even look at Hai Dongqing. It was not that he did not wish to look at her, but that they were too close. They were separated by not even a distance of a meter, and he could smell the faint fragrance from her body. Her chest had a elegant curvature. It was also full, and there was a healthy luster to it to her sparkling and translucent snow-white skin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How narcissistic. I have no interest in younger guys.” Hai Dongqing found it funny.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If this was the past, especially his past life, Qing Shui would look at such woman and drool. At that time, Qing Shui would never have thought that there would be any interaction with them because of his personality. He never would have been able to manage these kind of women.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s talk business. I feel that you all are leaving this place, right?” Qing Shui raised his head and looked at Hai Dongqing as he finished speaking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You guessed right, but there is no prize. Let’s talk about this villa, then. This villa is not selling for cash.” Hai Dongqing felt like laughing. She seemed to be very relaxed around this youth, despite him being the patriarch of the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and said: “that seemed obvious. After all, the Hai Clan is not short on money.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Miss Hai, what should I use to exchange for this villa?” Qing Shui did not wait for Hai Dongqing to reply before asking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know. Anything is fine, as long as I can be satisfied.” Hai Dongqing said after thinking for a little.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went black, then said: “please give me a rough idea. For example, what kind of things would you like? This way, it would speed up this transaction if I have it.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That's hard to say. The villa is here, what do you feel this is worth? Unless you have too many good things and have everything? Why don’t you take out what you are willing to exchange and let me pick?” Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled silently, then he took out a silk shirt from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and placed it on the table: “How about this?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing was speechless. She could not help but think that the silk shirt was good, but if he wanted to exchange this shirt of this large villa, it would not be justified.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You wish to use this silk shirt to exchange?” Hai Dongqing was moved by her emotions for the first time, during this period of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, you can try this silk shirt first, then see how much am I lacking? What do you think?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing looked seriously at Qing Shui. which caused Qing Shui to lower his head. Her bright eyes seemed to see through Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!” Hai Dongqing smile. She took that shirt and turned her body to head upstairs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a while, about 15 minutes, Hai Dongqing surprising wore her original clothes down. The silk shirt was arranged neatly as though it had never been worn before. Her eyes were full of excitement.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once again, Hai Dongqing took a seat opposite Qing Shui. She blinked her beautiful eyes and looked at Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright Miss Hai, please stop looking. I already have a woman.” QIng Shui rubbed his nose and said bitterly. He felt uncomfortable when such a beauty looked at him with that kind of gaze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“In your dreams. Learning such bad things at a young age!” Hai Dongqing laughed. It was strange. She did not know why she felt so relaxed within such little time. Maybe it was because this youth was excellent, or maybe he was not like other men who looked at her with ravenous eyes. Perhaps his age was too young…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am very satisfied with this silk shirt, only……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I know you are a honest person, so I won’t take advantage of you.” Qing Shui took out a pair of shoes, bracelet, a Great Revitalizing Pellet, and a Tri-Acupoint Clearing Pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He handed those over to Hai Dongqing. With such a big villa, Qing Shui felt it inconceivable to trade a silk shirt for it. Maybe the miss of the Hai Clan liked it a lot and did not know what to do. She also was too embarrassed to bargain. After all, the value of that silk shirt was not small. This bit of Martial Saint beast skin was incredibly valuable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Great Revitalizing Pellet!” Hai Dongqing exclaimed in shock when she saw the pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You recognized this pellet?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, but the one you have seemed to be a little different from the one in the legends. Maybe in the future, you would be able to refine a true Great Revitalizing Pellet.” Hai Dongqing said excitedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A true Great Revitalizing Pellet?” Qing Shu felt a little deceived. Wasn’t this the Great Revitalizing Pellet? What true Great Revitalizing Pellet……&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The true Great Revitalizing Pellet is out of the strong medicines of the World of the Nine Continents. It is very rare but does exist. Its effects are also very strong, it can regrow flesh or even a leg. No matter what it is, the pill is capable of regrowing it. However, the amount each pill can regrow is only 2 jin. The effects of a permanent increase of 50% of strength is only applicable to the first pallet. It can temporarily raise strength by 100% and lasts for 15 minutes! What effects does your pill have?” Hai Dongqing smiled at Qing Shui. Her expression was a little hopeful.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 552 - Hai Dongqing</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">A day had past by the time Qing Shui returned from his meeting with Elder Ge. Because of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui often felt that time in reality was very short. Thus, most of the day would have already passed by the time he had a chance to take a breather.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Among the three generations of the Qing Clan, Qing Bei joined the Heavenly Palace. Luan Luan, who was the fourth generation of the Qing Clan, also joined the Heavenly Palace. Mingyue Gelou, Shi Qingzhuang, and Wenren Wu-shuang also joined the Heavenly Palace under the banner of the Starmoon Hall rather the Misty Hall’s.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Jiang and Qing He also joined the Starmoon Hall. The rest of them, including Lin Zhanhan, did not join the Heavenly Palace. They either had yet reach the Xiantian Realm yet or reached the Xiantian realm by means of the Xiantian Golden Pellet. As for Lin Zhanhan, Qing Shui intended for him to protect the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even so, Qing Shui was still worried, therefore Qing Shui intended to raise the strength of the Qing Clan members during this period of time. He wanted to make sure they would have the ability to protect themselves the moment he left Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the second day after arriving at the Heavenly Palace, Qing Shui went down the mountain to find a suitable lot of land or pavilion for sale. Qing Shui was not lacking in money, as he had accumulated many treasures, gold, and silver in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left the Heavenly Palace alone, then went to the lively city of Continent's Capital. Continent's Capital’s roads and pavilions were much wider and taller than those of Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the demonic beasts and horse carriages on the road were of a superior grade. After all, this was the Continent's Capital, the most bustling place of the continent. The transportation, business, sects, and family clans were the most developed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui aimlessly wandered among the crowd, his gaze sweeping the pavilions that lined the two sides. The highest pavilions were ten odd stories high. Although they were not particularly high, the pavilions gave off a sense of magnificence and stability, an extraordinary grandeur.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Many of the wealthy stayed in villas. The land area was big, and in it were fake mountains, ponds, forest, pavilions, everything that was needed. One could tell in a glance that these belonged to those family clans or the wealthy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This large road was also one of the most flourishing road, and its name was very poetic as well: Ocean Blue Astral Road. Qing Shui didn’t know the origins of this name, neither was he interested in knowing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Along the way, he saw many which were up for rent. When Qing Shui inquired about them, the other party wasn’t willing to sell. Thus, he did not bother trying to offer a high price. Even if he offered a value twice the market prince, they would not sell. Furthermore, Qing Shui was not that satisfied with these places.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every now and then, he would see a few places for sale but they were too small!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not even bother to go up and ask. He simply looked for others. After all, this was the most bustling area, so much so that even the businesses were good. Along the road, the Cloth shop, weapons shop, banks, pawn shops, armor shops, medicine shops, physician store, and countless many others all seemed to have good business. Thus, there were very few shop lots for sale. They would only sell those lots if they were leaving Continent's Capital.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time slowly went by, and soon, it was noon. Qing Shui felt depressed. He had the money but could not spend it. Could it be that he had to buy his own land and build it himself?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head, he could only buy good land. Actually, with Qing Shui’s status as the Heavenly Palace patriarch, he could get anything he wanted in the Continent's Capital. Qing Shui did not want to did it that way, however, as he detested this way of doing things. What’s more, he had no other use for all his money.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En!” Qing Shui noticed a large sign that made him excited. For Sale! More importantly, this place was big enough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at it and felt that this place was better than he imagined. The location was the best spot of the Ocean Blue Astral Road.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The land area was about as big as Qing Village. In the Greencloud Continent, the price of such a villa would be astronomical, and regular people would not be able to afford such a villa.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Normally, people who owned such a villa would not sell it away. After taking another look, Qing Shui became distracted. This was actually the Hai Clan…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hesitated as he stood there. The was the ancestral home of the Hai Clan. Why was the Hai Clan selling away their ancestral home? Qing Shi felt this matter unimaginable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were a famous Clan in the Greencloud Continent. If anyone said that the Hai Clan was lacking money, they would drown to death from the crowd’s spit. However, it seemed that the Hai Clan was selling away their ancestral home now. Who would do that unless they were lacking money?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that they are leaving? Leaving the Greencloud Continent forever?” Qing Shui speculated. The more he thought about it, the more plausible it became.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Taking wide strides, Qing Shui stepped through the wide doors of the Hai Clan. There was not even a guard at guarding the door. As he walked, he thought that it would be great if he bought the Hai Clan’s villa.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui felt that it was not so easy to purchase. Otherwise, this offer wouldn’t have even existed. Upon coming to this train of thought, he smiled. Qing Shui felt that there would be a good show to watch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once he entered, he saw two people chatting with each other. When they saw Qing Shui, they quickly kept quiet. The one on the left side was a youth with thick brows. He smile towards Qing Shui and asked: “Sir, how may I help you?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Isn’t this villa for sale? I wish to buy it!” Qing Shui answered with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man on the other side, a slightly plump man with small eyes, gave Qing Shui a few looks. Perhaps Qing Shui had a certain presence, because after the man looked at him, he said: “Sir, please follow me.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, there were not many people in the Hai Clan. plus, it was cold now. In such a large villa, he did not see many people in it. He followed that plump man with small eyes to the backyard.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The did not see anyone on the way!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They stopped at a gorgeous pavilion, after which the man said: “Young Mistress, there is someone here to buy the house.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Allow him to come in!” An elegant voice with a certain magnetic quality rang out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sir, please!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded his head and walked into the gorgeous pavilion. After he entered, he found himself in a huge hall. This was the architectural style of the World of the Nine Continents. The whole of the first floor was basically the living room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A woman stood in the middle of the living room with a smile on her face. Her figure was tall and graceful; there was an intellectual air to it. Her charm was the kind that could captivate others.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s you!” That intellectual and graceful voice, the stunningly exceptional face… they exuded a certain kind of charm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This women was Hai Dongqing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had met this woman at the Old Ancestor’s funeral before, although this was his first time seeing her face. This woman had a intellectual and gracefully charm, in addition, an exceptional face. Even Qing Shui, who had not planned to take in any more woman, could not help but agree that she was peerless.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are selling this place?” Qing Shui smile and retracted his gaze.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, are you interested?” Hai Dongqing’s eyebrows relaxed as though she was in a particularly good mood at this moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En, yes. I wonder how much are you selling for?” Qing Shui was straight to the point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come, have a seat and we will discuss. Let me get you some tea first!” Hai Dongqing invited Qing Shui to the room, then went to a room north of the living room</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat down and looked at the surroundings here. The decorations were not too luxurious, but it allow people to feel that this was a wealthy family. From the furniture to the decorations they were all of a superior standard and brand new.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the west wall, there was an humongous painting of a snowy land. It was a vast expanse of whiteness and the field of view was extremely expansive. On the extreme left, there were snow-white plum blossoms which stood tall and straight in this snowy heaven, unafraid of the cold. In the middle was a big ice mountain, and on the extreme right, there was a endless glacier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The roof and walls were a light green color. In this hot summer day, it caused Qing Shui to a faint coolness. He felt very comfortable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Hai Dongqing brought out a wooden tray which carried a pot of tea and two snow-white cups. He noticed everything in the room, as well as everything on Hai Dongqing, were all white. He knew then that this woman liked snow-white colors.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sorry for the wait!” Hai Dongqing treaded lightly to across the table.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s fine, sorry to trouble you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing filled the two tea cups to 70 percent, upon which a faint tea fragrance wafted out. Although the tea fragrance was faint, it was very distinct. Any person would feel refreshed upon smelling it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is it very busy being the patriarch of Heavenly Palace?” Hai Dongqing smiled as she offered Qing Shui a cup of tea.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly replied: “Not really, I just came back yesterday. I am still not clear on the Heavenly Palace’s matters.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The working class uses strength, the middle class uses their intelligence, the upper class uses people!” Hai Dongqing smiled as she picked up her cup.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am not as good as you say I am. I just lack time.” Qing Shui shook his head and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing smiled and looked at Qing Shui, that gaze seeming to show that she was especially curious about Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t look at me like that. Curious about me? I’m here to buy the house.” Qing Shui smiled at this beautiful yet stunningly graceful woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing was not embarrassed. Instead, she seemed even happier: “I was quite curious about you. I wonder how you cultivate? You could reach such heights at such a young age. Within the World of the Nine Continents, there would not be many youths who could achieve the same cultivation as you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t do too curious about men, otherwise you might get yourself into a difficult situation. It’s a good thing that I’m young.” Qing Shui did not even look at Hai Dongqing. It was not that he did not wish to look at her, but that they were too close. They were separated by not even a distance of a meter, and he could smell the faint fragrance from her body. Her chest had a elegant curvature. It was also full, and there was a healthy luster to it to her sparkling and translucent snow-white skin.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How narcissistic. I have no interest in younger guys.” Hai Dongqing found it funny.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If this was the past, especially his past life, Qing Shui would look at such woman and drool. At that time, Qing Shui would never have thought that there would be any interaction with them because of his personality. He never would have been able to manage these kind of women.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s talk business. I feel that you all are leaving this place, right?” Qing Shui raised his head and looked at Hai Dongqing as he finished speaking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You guessed right, but there is no prize. Let’s talk about this villa, then. This villa is not selling for cash.” Hai Dongqing felt like laughing. She seemed to be very relaxed around this youth, despite him being the patriarch of the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and said: “that seemed obvious. After all, the Hai Clan is not short on money.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Miss Hai, what should I use to exchange for this villa?” Qing Shui did not wait for Hai Dongqing to reply before asking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know. Anything is fine, as long as I can be satisfied.” Hai Dongqing said after thinking for a little.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went black, then said: “please give me a rough idea. For example, what kind of things would you like? This way, it would speed up this transaction if I have it.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That's hard to say. The villa is here, what do you feel this is worth? Unless you have too many good things and have everything? Why don’t you take out what you are willing to exchange and let me pick?” Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled silently, then he took out a silk shirt from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and placed it on the table: “How about this?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing was speechless. She could not help but think that the silk shirt was good, but if he wanted to exchange this shirt of this large villa, it would not be justified.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You wish to use this silk shirt to exchange?” Hai Dongqing was moved by her emotions for the first time, during this period of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, you can try this silk shirt first, then see how much am I lacking? What do you think?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing looked seriously at Qing Shui. which caused Qing Shui to lower his head. Her bright eyes seemed to see through Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!” Hai Dongqing smile. She took that shirt and turned her body to head upstairs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a while, about 15 minutes, Hai Dongqing surprising wore her original clothes down. The silk shirt was arranged neatly as though it had never been worn before. Her eyes were full of excitement.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once again, Hai Dongqing took a seat opposite Qing Shui. She blinked her beautiful eyes and looked at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright Miss Hai, please stop looking. I already have a woman.” QIng Shui rubbed his nose and said bitterly. He felt uncomfortable when such a beauty looked at him with that kind of gaze.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“In your dreams. Learning such bad things at a young age!” Hai Dongqing laughed. It was strange. She did not know why she felt so relaxed within such little time. Maybe it was because this youth was excellent, or maybe he was not like other men who looked at her with ravenous eyes. Perhaps his age was too young…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am very satisfied with this silk shirt, only……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I know you are a honest person, so I won’t take advantage of you.” Qing Shui took out a pair of shoes, bracelet, a Great Revitalizing Pellet, and a Tri-Acupoint Clearing Pellet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He handed those over to Hai Dongqing. With such a big villa, Qing Shui felt it inconceivable to trade a silk shirt for it. Maybe the miss of the Hai Clan liked it a lot and did not know what to do. She also was too embarrassed to bargain. After all, the value of that silk shirt was not small. This bit of Martial Saint beast skin was incredibly valuable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Great Revitalizing Pellet!” Hai Dongqing exclaimed in shock when she saw the pellet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You recognized this pellet?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En, but the one you have seemed to be a little different from the one in the legends. Maybe in the future, you would be able to refine a true Great Revitalizing Pellet.” Hai Dongqing said excitedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A true Great Revitalizing Pellet?” Qing Shu felt a little deceived. Wasn’t this the Great Revitalizing Pellet? What true Great Revitalizing Pellet……&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The true Great Revitalizing Pellet is out of the strong medicines of the World of the Nine Continents. It is very rare but does exist. Its effects are also very strong, it can regrow flesh or even a leg. No matter what it is, the pill is capable of regrowing it. However, the amount each pill can regrow is only 2 jin. The effects of a permanent increase of 50% of strength is only applicable to the first pallet. It can temporarily raise strength by 100% and lasts for 15 minutes! What effects does your pill have?” Hai Dongqing smiled at Qing Shui. Her expression was a little hopeful.</p>
