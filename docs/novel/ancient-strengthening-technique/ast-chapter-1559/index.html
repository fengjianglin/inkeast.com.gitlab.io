 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Qin Qing’s shy face, Qing Shui felt very satisfied. He immediately pulled her and embraced her with his arms. In response to that, Qin Qing cried out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t move… All I want to do is just to hug you. I promise I won’t do anything else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing didn’t struggle. Instead, she put both of her arms around his shoulders and slightly lifted up her head to look at him. She was a bit shorter compared to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have already got quite a few wives……” Qing Shui found himself really stupid for saying it. Why did he choose to mention this when everything was going so well? Nevertheless, it’s too late now as he has already said it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response to that, Qin Qing’s reaction wasn’t really that dramatic. She looked at Qing Shui very calmly and said, “Good thing that you are being honest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I just want to let you know that… I have thought of giving up on you before, but I find it impossible to do so…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing had already managed to feel it from the last time Qing Shui made his temporary departure. Eventually, he was still unable to let go of her and came back. She smiled and said, “There is something which I am really curious to know. You have been sacrificing your love for the women around you, but are you really able to share it among them so equally?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched as she shook her head, “Why must i share my love? I dedicate 100% of my love to each and everyone of them. Both physically and mentally, I give them my everything. I can’t afford to give up on any of them. If I must choose to sacrifice one of them, I would rather that person to be me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are so greedy!” Qin Qing sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, she would never have thought about sharing a man with other women. Of course, it was given that she was able to find a man to get married to. But now, though she might not have entrusted herself to Qing Shui yet, she knew that her age was slowly catching up to her. She was well aware that Qing Shui had other wives, but she was still unable to let him go firmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am greedy, I am well aware of that. I used to also look forward to being an ordinary person, where I would find myself a wife who may not look really beautiful, but she would be whom I love and she would love me back, and I would spend my life with her.” Qing Shui was reminded of the things from his previous incarnation. Unfortunately, not everything could return to how it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why would you want a wife who doesn’t look beautiful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If an ordinary man was to find a very beautiful wife, he would find it really hard to keep her. In some extreme cases, they might even suffer from some catastrophes because of it. Beautiful women tend to have very wild hearts. If you weren’t capable enough, it’s best not to provoke them, or else, you would be bound to suffer from it.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do I look beautiful? Do the rest of your women look beautiful?” Qin Qing asked gently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Beautiful, very beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Won’t you feel troubled with it then?” Qin Qing asked in a joking manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also smiled. Indeed, beautiful women tend to carry troubles with them. Just like a few of the women around him, they all had their own problems. It was through the process of helping them solve their own problems when Qing Shui started nurturing feelings for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course I am scared. But when compared to you, these troubles are nothing.” Qing Shui said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing couldn’t help but shake her head as she saw such a lowly action from Qing Shui. She then carried on and said, “Give me some time, alright? I am not ready yet for this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ready for what? Are you afraid that I might swallow you whole?” Qing Shui asked in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you asking for a beating? Regardless of whether I am getting married or not, I won’t look for other men. Are you feeling more satisfied now?” Qin Qing said after a few thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in his previous incarnations, some people had feared marriage before. But those who feared it were usually people who had divorced before or children whom have experienced their parents living separately. Qing Shui didn’t know if she was one of them, but that didn’t seem to be the case.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I would never force a person whom I love. So long as you are not ready, I won’t swallow you whole.” Qing Shui said in a serious tone. He did this purposely all just so he could cling to her for a while longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing didn’t want to continue talking about this, “Let’s head back. You still have to prepare for your journey tomorrow. It will be better if you get ready now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is nothing which I have to prepare for. Are you feeling reluctant to part ways with me?” Qing Shui was being vain. His expression when he said it was a bit exaggerated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing felt a strong urge to punch him in the face. She nodded and said with her teeth clenched, “Yes, I am reluctant to part with you. Does that mean you will stay behind for me instead of searching for your wife?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his head, “You are also my woman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the next day, Qing Shui bid his farewell to the people from Qin King Manor with the exception of Qin Qing, whom sent him off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is as far as I will take you. Stay cautious along your journey.” Qin Qing slowly floated up from the Hellfire Phoenix’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui summoned back his Hellfire Phoenix, leaving only himself and Qin Qing in mid-air. He didn’t say much. Instead, Qin Qing was the one who took a few steps forward. Qin Qing’s good figure was extremely stunning. Even air-walking itself, when used by Qin Qing, had managed to reach its peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She slowly embraced Qing Shui’s neck, “Are you satisfied now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his arms and wrapped them around her waist. The sensation of her body which Qing Shui felt when hugging her made him felt as if blood was rushing through his entire body. The detailed and fine curve of her body was very distinct.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am satisfied now. But it will be better if you would give me a kiss.” Qing Shui said in a greedy tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing slightly lowered down her head. This time, it could be considered that she had responded to his request. Though she didn’t agree to it directly, it was basically no different from her actually doing so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, she quickly lifted up her head and kissed Qing Shui’s cheek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. The soft and tender sensation which he felt on his face was very clear and distinct. Though it might be small. Qing Shui felt unusually startled by it. In return, he also landed a gentle kiss on her cheek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, like he was still unsatisfied with her kiss, he immediately stuck his mouth onto her cherry lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The kiss this time lasted for quite a while. While kissing, Qing Shui’s hands were also constantly on the move. At the beginning, he was only slowly feeling her round butt. But soon, he began to rub and pinch it, though he was only doing it very gently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only until when one of his hands has reached up to the bulging part of &nbsp;her chest that Qin Qing pushed down his hands and stopped him from touching her. But now, Qing Shui’s hand was already grabbing her breast. Not only so, he was directly touching her skin. The smooth and spongy sensation when touching her caused Qing Shui’s body to undergo changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing also felt it. Her breath started getting a bit hurried, “Don’t move!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped moving. He slowly loosen up his grasp on her breast. As he looked at the attractive side-view of her face, he couldn’t help but move his head forward again and suck on her cherry lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remember what you promised me before. Don’t go over the line, otherwise, I will never see you ever again.” Qin Qing broke free from Qing Shui’s lips and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It would be a while until I come back. Why don’t you let me kiss you until I am satisfied?” Right now, Qing SHui was feeling a strong urge to swallow her whole. But he was aware that he mustn’t let everything go to ruin just because of his impatience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing didn’t say anything. Instead, she took the initiative and kissed Qing Shui… Passionately responding to his feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui left. In his head, it was full of Qin Qing’s figure. Qing Shui had managed to kiss her to the extent that her cherry lips were slightly swollen because of it. But this only made her even sexier than before. With the exception of a few of the important parts across her body, Qing Shui had basically felt every single part of her body with his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Somehow, Qing Shui now felt that his mind had already been put at ease. For his entire lifetime, he would only allow for Qin Qing to be his woman. Also, he was able to feel that Qin Qing loved him. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have tolerated him so much.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miss Qin was the type of person who couldn’t stand even a tiny bit of sand in her eye. The reason why she hadn’t agreed to Qing Shui’s request might possibly be due to that she was yet to be able to completely loosen up. But she was also aware that there was no longer any retreat route for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sacred Might Dynasty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui once again arrived at Sacred Might Dynasty. His purpose of visiting this place was in order to wait for the mysterious woman. It was just that at the moment, there was still one month until the designated meeting time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like usual, Qing Shui disguised himself with the look of the middle-aged man. He wasn’t afraid. He was just trying to avoid trouble. He was alone drinking wine in the Prosperous Longevity Inn while enjoying the view outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t sure if the mysterious woman would renege her promise and not turn up. Nevertheless, he still decided to stay behind and wait for a while. Since it was related to Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui regretted not following her. Though it was a bit rude, it shouldn’t be bad to the extent to which he would lose track of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But back then, it was due to the concern he had for Qin Qing… Indeed, one could never have things in both ways. The only thing Qing Shui could do now was to pray that the woman was fine and could make it back here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Qing Shui didn’t feel anything different. Sacred Might Dynasty was just like how it used to be before. Furthermore, the Chen Clan and the Tang Clan had also received sudden boosts in strength respectively and were slowly taking the Chai and Yue clan’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just now, Qing Shui had finally come to understand that a particular dynasty would need strength from different parts of the area to act as its support. There were some who were directly exposed to the public, whereas some would be well hidden in the dark. Unless an extremely powerful and formidable clan was capable of protecting the entire dynasty, in usual cases, a dynasty would normally require a group of clans together to help support itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a lot of aristocratic clans. Some enjoyed doing things in public, and some others would prefer to be more conservative. There were only very few clans that could rise to the top and hold high positions. Hence, for those who truly achieved it, though they might be honored by people, due to the fact that they were exposed, they were also bound to face more danger than others. The reason being that they would continuously be put in different sorts of troubles, so much so that they might end up being blamed for certain problems by others or becoming scapegoats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when Qing Shui took up his wine cup and was about to drink his wine, he realized that the man sitting nearby was looking at him. When the man realized that Qing Shui was looking at him, he smiled and approached with his own wine cup.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Would you mind if I sit here?” The man’s age was very unpredictable. He might seem young, but he also had a matured look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take a seat. Do you know me?” Qing Shui greeted him casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I found your body figure really familiar. Was my assumption right?” The man held up his wine cup and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned and smiled. The disguised face only altered the user’s face and hair. Other than that, it didn’t serve any other purpose. It would have been wiser if he went on to change his body figure or structure as well. But nothing could beat changing the aura emitting out of his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected for him to be exposed in this way. It seemed that it would be tough for people who had the intention to know him to not recognize him. In fact, it was already to the point that he was right below the person’s eyelid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t scared of people noticing him, hence, he smiled and said, “Yes, is there anything I can do for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Tang Yilong. I would like to be your friend.” The man smiled and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui figured out that he was a member of the Tang Clan. At the moment, the Tang Clan was counted as the most honorable clan in the Holy Might Dynasty. As he gazed at the man in front of him, he could feel a decent amount of strength being emitted from him. However, it was still not enough to amuse Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why would you want to know me? I am an outsider and will be leaving soon. Could it be that you are also leaving?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked elegant. However, his main feature lied in how he gave people the impression that he was a knowledgeable person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t necessarily have to go with you to be your friend. I can do just the same by staying here. To put it bluntly, making friends with you will benefit the both of us.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, I would like to hear how it will benefit the both of us.” Qing Shui put down the wine cup he was holding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there not anyone you would be concerned about once you leave this place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Qing Shui was about to say something, the man continued on and said, “I don’t mean anything wrong. I just want to be your friend. As for Qin King Manor, I ensure that the Tang Clan will build a sustainable relationship with them, even more than being great friends. As the saying goes, the more allies you make, the stronger you become.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Listening up to this point, Qing Shui smiled, “Well then, can you tell me what I would have to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope that you can interact with the Tang Clan a few times and let the public know that the Tang Clan, Qin King Manor and you share a really good relationship.”</span></p>
