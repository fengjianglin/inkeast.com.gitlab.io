 <p><strong>Chapter 555 Qing Shui's Methods.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 555 - Qing Shui's Methods</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen's thoughts flew very far away...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her birth father had sent her to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord when she was very young; the person she had called elder brother for decades now wanted her to be his wife; the Elder Martial Brother who had treated her very well all this time also had ill-intentions toward her; the person who she had addressed as her adoptive husband also wanted her to marry his son...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Gradually, the same happened to everyone close to her. She started to reject everyone, especially men in particular, that was until she met Qing Shui. Back then, she had wanted to kill this guy who had taken advantage of her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But because the situation was prolonged, tens of times a day, although she did not met him in person, his presence was imprinted in her heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was hate!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But no matter what, even if it was hate, he was already cast a shadow in her heart. He had become a memory she could not erase from her mind. If she were to get married to someone in the future, she must at least kill this guy who had acted indecently toward her for so long. But whenever she saw this man with a pair of clear eyes, she hesitated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Women are very strange creatures, especially ladies like Di Chen, who would not be able to accept any taints on themselves, even if it was just a scene in the Dream Among The Sea of Flowers.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Therefore, after a series of unexpected events, she held back and decided to give him a chance. At the same time, was giving herself a chance. This was also the reason why she went through so much trouble so many times in order to save Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen looked at Qing Shui in a daze. This man had not let her down. Although he was still not comparable to those people, it was just a matter of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She hoped that one day, she would be able to fall in love with him. Hoped that one day he could stand at the top of the world. She hoped that one day, he could bring her back to that family to show them that she was living an extremely good life and let them know that their decisions back then were extremely foolish.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, do you really have to go to the Central Continent now? With your talent, you should be able to reach the Martial Saint level very quickly. By then, you should be able to fend for yourself. If you were to go now, everyone will be worried." Di Chen spoke softly to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Sister Chen, I know this. But I must go to the Central Continent. The main reason is because I feel that I've reached a bottleneck. I feel that if I were to leave now, I will be able to attain a breakthrough. Qing Shui looked at this goddess-like lady with a majestic aura. When he heard her words of concern, he felt very warm inside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"How about this, let Qing`er return with you. She needs to go home too. With her along, the two of you can take care of each other along the journey." Di Chen paused a little before she continued.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that her intention was because of what Di Qing had said previously. After they had reached the Central Continent, she wanted some people to feel that because of Di Qing, Di Clan's Young Miss was very close to this man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Why? Are you not happy with this arrangement? How about you just take it as &nbsp;escorting me back to the Central Continent?" Di Qing smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know why, but he felt nothing towards this beauty who’s presence was wispy like an illusion. Her disposition was a bit like Di Chen and Yiye Jiange, but yet something was different about her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen was one who was spiritually unrestrained, Yiye Jiange was one who was otherworldly, but Di Qing had a humanly aura to her. However, at the same time, it was hard for others to see through her. She was wispy, mysterious, decisive, and sharp.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Alright!" In the end, Qing Shui could only reply this one word...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Treat my elder sister better!" Di Qing said teasingly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing`er, what rubbish are you talking about?" Di Chen shot back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was once again confused. This was the second time. He had always been intelligent and held only respect toward Di Chen. Moreover, he had never thought of having a relationship with Di Chen. Therefore, he was feeling at a loss, but he would not think too much of it either.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"When are you planning to head off?" Di Qing grinned and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Soon, no longer than half a year." Qing Shui did not think much and replied. He had already planned out everything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the Heavenly Palace's main hall!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"The reason I've called everyone here today is just to say some simple things." Qing Shui smiled and looked at the hundreds of people below.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"This is Elder Ge, I'm sure many of you know of him!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Isn't this Elder Feng?!" A voice full of disdain spoke up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Elder Jiang, do not be disrespectful. Elder Ge is a senior from the Old Ancestor's generation." Elder Gongsun looked toward that elder with triangular eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old man Gongsun, why the act? Everyone knows that this is Elder Feng, someone who was goofing off in the Heavenly Palace for a few hundred years and had also tainted our reputation." Old Man Jin from the Golden Throne Palace smirked as he said to Elder Gongsun.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Enough! This isn't a marketplace. After I'm done saying my piece, if you want to quarrel, take it outside!" Feeling annoyed, Qing Shui waved his hand and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Jin Clan's old man with disgust. This guy was short-sighted, did not repent, and the longer he lived, the more ignorant he became.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'll be leaving for a period of time and will be leaving the affairs of the Heavenly Palace to Elder Ge."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui finished, everyone fell into a daze. Many people did not say anything, but everyone knew that this Elder Ge was a crazy man and was only at the Xiantian level. Was it not a joke to leave the matters of Heavenly Palace to a person like him?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, many people still chose to remain silent. Although they had a lot to say, they decided to keep quiet. This was the way to do things in life and was also a means of survival.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Patriarch, are you kidding? Getting a lunatic to take charge of us?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Elder Jin is right. If that's the case, I, Jian Nianhe, will be the first person to disagree." That Elder Jiang from earlier spoke up again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not understand. Did these people not know that the bird which takes the lead was usually the one to be shot down? Could it be that they had lived long enough a life and had seen through a lot of things?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It doesn't matter whether you agree or not. Are you the Patriarch or am I the Patriarch? Do you believe that I'll strip you of your position right now?" Qing Shui asked calmly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These people had lived a bulk of their life, but some of them still liked to flaunt their seniority. Qing Shui did not mind teaching them a lesson before he left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Patriarch, the Heavenly Palace is one of the top sects in Greencloud Continent. If we let a lunatic take charge of things, we would become a laughing stock..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slap!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a flash, Qing Shui appeared next to Elder Jin and launched his Tiger Fist! His speed was so fast that no one could see him clearly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ahhh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a terrible cry, Elder Jin was sent flying!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not stop. He kicked out with his left foot as if it was a gigantic whip!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slap!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elder Jiang was sent flying with the kick as well!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not kill them but merely crippled them by snapping off their meridian channels. With this, they would not be able to use their cultivation but their lifespan would not be reduced.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"In the future, when I speak, those who interrupt before I'm done will be crippled immediately." Qing Shui returned to his seat.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The main hall immediately turned speechless and Qing Shui looked at Elder Jin and Elder Jiang who were not able to get up yet and said, "Don't think I don't know what you guys have been up to. You've sold out the Heavenly Palace's benefits to exchange for your own. I'll settle this with the two of you later."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"From today onward, Elder Ge will temporarily take over my position until I return. One more thing, Elder Ge has recovered and is now at the Martial Saint level." Qing Shui looked at Elder Jin and Elder Jiang as he smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone in the main hall had an excited expression. Even Cang Wuya did not know about this beforehand. Qing Shui saw that Elder Jin's and Elder Jiang's expression had turned pale immediately!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Elder Ge, Patriarch, we were blind to not have seen this earlier!" Elder Jin and Elder Jiang turned to kneel on the floor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Shut up. One more word and I'll make the two of you disappear."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui suddenly recalled what he had said to Huoyun Liu-Li earlier in the day. He was about to leave. For the past few years, it had been tough on this lass. She liked him, and he should give her some hope and promise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although a promise meant nothing, Qing Shui would definitely make good on his words.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They knew Qing Shui's character, and would not let him make them any promises. They hoped that their relationship with Qing Shui was one filled with spiritual connection and love, and not one for the sake of fulfilling a promise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Walking up to Huoyun Liu-Li's room, Qing Shui softly pushed the door!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was locked!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's activated his Spiritual Sense and knew that Huoyun Liu-Li was not asleep. He knocked gently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Dong dong!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the silent night, the sound was very clear. This was a Continent's Capital and could also be said to be a bustling city. The place was bustling with activity and excitement all day long, both in the day and at night.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During nighttime, the streets would be filled with food stalls and night markets. Even shops like the cloth stores, the clothes stores, and the medicinal stores would remain open. The most lively place would, of course, be some of the taverns and the places with unique businesses.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such places were not uncommon in the World of the Nine Continents. There were many adventurers in this world and they would frequently hunt down demonic beasts or take on jobs to escort and protect mercenary teams. They lived a dangerous life and could lose their life at anytime.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They earned a lot of money but tended to not live to enjoy them. They were suppressed mentally and needed a place to relax and vent their stress.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The best way to vent out would be on women!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Each time they stopped by a place, they would release their frustrations without a care on how much money they spent. Of course, it was an exception for those who had their partners with them. Those without would look for the brothels in the area.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, those who could set up such brothels would tend to be sects or reputable clans with great power and authority. However, Qing Shui had not heard that that the brothel was opened by the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sound of the door opening rang out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui regained his senses and saw that Huoyun Liu-Li was in her pajamas. After seeing that it was Qing Shui, she quickly lowered her head!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a flash, Qing Shui squeezed in and closed the door after him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I hope that this time around, it would not be the same as the other time!" Qing Shui recalled the agony of how he could only hug her for a night but not have his way with her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"This time around, even if you don't wish to touch me, I won't allow it."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui heard that magnetic and intoxicating voice and those words which made his blood gush all the way up to his head. He lifted Huoyun Liu-Li's slender body and walked toward that purple and beautiful bed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crazily kissed Huoyun Liu-Li on her eyes, nose, lips, neck, and lifted up her purple-colored nightwear. Her snow-white and flat abs were very firm, with no flabs at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li's body trembled and her hands hugged Qing Shui around the neck tightly! Her face burned up as if on fire, her eyes were soft like silk and and her messed up nightwear partially revealed her beautiful body before Qing Shui, exuding a fatal sense of seduction.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">"Why? Are you not happy with this arrangement? How about you just take it as &nbsp;escorting me back to the Central Continent?" Di Qing smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know why, but he felt nothing towards this beauty who’s presence was wispy like an illusion. Her disposition was a bit like Di Chen and Yiye Jiange, but yet something was different about her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Chen was one who was spiritually unrestrained, Yiye Jiange was one who was otherworldly, but Di Qing had a humanly aura to her. However, at the same time, it was hard for others to see through her. She was wispy, mysterious, decisive, and sharp.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Alright!" In the end, Qing Shui could only reply this one word...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Treat my elder sister better!" Di Qing said teasingly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing`er, what rubbish are you talking about?" Di Chen shot back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was once again confused. This was the second time. He had always been intelligent and held only respect toward Di Chen. Moreover, he had never thought of having a relationship with Di Chen. Therefore, he was feeling at a loss, but he would not think too much of it either.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"When are you planning to head off?" Di Qing grinned and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Soon, no longer than half a year." Qing Shui did not think much and replied. He had already planned out everything.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the Heavenly Palace's main hall!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"The reason I've called everyone here today is just to say some simple things." Qing Shui smiled and looked at the hundreds of people below.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"This is Elder Ge, I'm sure many of you know of him!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Isn't this Elder Feng?!" A voice full of disdain spoke up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Elder Jiang, do not be disrespectful. Elder Ge is a senior from the Old Ancestor's generation." Elder Gongsun looked toward that elder with triangular eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old man Gongsun, why the act? Everyone knows that this is Elder Feng, someone who was goofing off in the Heavenly Palace for a few hundred years and had also tainted our reputation." Old Man Jin from the Golden Throne Palace smirked as he said to Elder Gongsun.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Enough! This isn't a marketplace. After I'm done saying my piece, if you want to quarrel, take it outside!" Feeling annoyed, Qing Shui waved his hand and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Jin Clan's old man with disgust. This guy was short-sighted, did not repent, and the longer he lived, the more ignorant he became.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'll be leaving for a period of time and will be leaving the affairs of the Heavenly Palace to Elder Ge."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui finished, everyone fell into a daze. Many people did not say anything, but everyone knew that this Elder Ge was a crazy man and was only at the Xiantian level. Was it not a joke to leave the matters of Heavenly Palace to a person like him?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, many people still chose to remain silent. Although they had a lot to say, they decided to keep quiet. This was the way to do things in life and was also a means of survival.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Patriarch, are you kidding? Getting a lunatic to take charge of us?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Elder Jin is right. If that's the case, I, Jian Nianhe, will be the first person to disagree." That Elder Jiang from earlier spoke up again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not understand. Did these people not know that the bird which takes the lead was usually the one to be shot down? Could it be that they had lived long enough a life and had seen through a lot of things?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It doesn't matter whether you agree or not. Are you the Patriarch or am I the Patriarch? Do you believe that I'll strip you of your position right now?" Qing Shui asked calmly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These people had lived a bulk of their life, but some of them still liked to flaunt their seniority. Qing Shui did not mind teaching them a lesson before he left.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Patriarch, the Heavenly Palace is one of the top sects in Greencloud Continent. If we let a lunatic take charge of things, we would become a laughing stock..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slap!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a flash, Qing Shui appeared next to Elder Jin and launched his Tiger Fist! His speed was so fast that no one could see him clearly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ahhh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a terrible cry, Elder Jin was sent flying!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not stop. He kicked out with his left foot as if it was a gigantic whip!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slap!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Jiang was sent flying with the kick as well!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not kill them but merely crippled them by snapping off their meridian channels. With this, they would not be able to use their cultivation but their lifespan would not be reduced.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"In the future, when I speak, those who interrupt before I'm done will be crippled immediately." Qing Shui returned to his seat.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The main hall immediately turned speechless and Qing Shui looked at Elder Jin and Elder Jiang who were not able to get up yet and said, "Don't think I don't know what you guys have been up to. You've sold out the Heavenly Palace's benefits to exchange for your own. I'll settle this with the two of you later."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"From today onward, Elder Ge will temporarily take over my position until I return. One more thing, Elder Ge has recovered and is now at the Martial Saint level." Qing Shui looked at Elder Jin and Elder Jiang as he smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone in the main hall had an excited expression. Even Cang Wuya did not know about this beforehand. Qing Shui saw that Elder Jin's and Elder Jiang's expression had turned pale immediately!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Elder Ge, Patriarch, we were blind to not have seen this earlier!" Elder Jin and Elder Jiang turned to kneel on the floor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Shut up. One more word and I'll make the two of you disappear."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui suddenly recalled what he had said to Huoyun Liu-Li earlier in the day. He was about to leave. For the past few years, it had been tough on this lass. She liked him, and he should give her some hope and promise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although a promise meant nothing, Qing Shui would definitely make good on his words.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They knew Qing Shui's character, and would not let him make them any promises. They hoped that their relationship with Qing Shui was one filled with spiritual connection and love, and not one for the sake of fulfilling a promise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Walking up to Huoyun Liu-Li's room, Qing Shui softly pushed the door!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was locked!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's activated his Spiritual Sense and knew that Huoyun Liu-Li was not asleep. He knocked gently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dong dong!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the silent night, the sound was very clear. This was a Continent's Capital and could also be said to be a bustling city. The place was bustling with activity and excitement all day long, both in the day and at night.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During nighttime, the streets would be filled with food stalls and night markets. Even shops like the cloth stores, the clothes stores, and the medicinal stores would remain open. The most lively place would, of course, be some of the taverns and the places with unique businesses.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Such places were not uncommon in the World of the Nine Continents. There were many adventurers in this world and they would frequently hunt down demonic beasts or take on jobs to escort and protect mercenary teams. They lived a dangerous life and could lose their life at anytime.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They earned a lot of money but tended to not live to enjoy them. They were suppressed mentally and needed a place to relax and vent their stress.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The best way to vent out would be on women!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Each time they stopped by a place, they would release their frustrations without a care on how much money they spent. Of course, it was an exception for those who had their partners with them. Those without would look for the brothels in the area.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, those who could set up such brothels would tend to be sects or reputable clans with great power and authority. However, Qing Shui had not heard that that the brothel was opened by the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sound of the door opening rang out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui regained his senses and saw that Huoyun Liu-Li was in her pajamas. After seeing that it was Qing Shui, she quickly lowered her head!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a flash, Qing Shui squeezed in and closed the door after him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I hope that this time around, it would not be the same as the other time!" Qing Shui recalled the agony of how he could only hug her for a night but not have his way with her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"This time around, even if you don't wish to touch me, I won't allow it."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui heard that magnetic and intoxicating voice and those words which made his blood gush all the way up to his head. He lifted Huoyun Liu-Li's slender body and walked toward that purple and beautiful bed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crazily kissed Huoyun Liu-Li on her eyes, nose, lips, neck, and lifted up her purple-colored nightwear. Her snow-white and flat abs were very firm, with no flabs at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li's body trembled and her hands hugged Qing Shui around the neck tightly! Her face burned up as if on fire, her eyes were soft like silk and and her messed up nightwear partially revealed her beautiful body before Qing Shui, exuding a fatal sense of seduction.</p>
