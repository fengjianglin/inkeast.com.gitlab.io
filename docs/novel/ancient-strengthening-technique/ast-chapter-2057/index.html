Can you please listen to me and don’t give up until the last moment?” Qing Shui regretted hitting her butt just now. He had been too careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also didn’t know why he would suddenly do that. After all, their relationship had yet to develop to the point where he could do that. What he did was rude. It might have to do with the time when Shen Huang embraced Qing Shui or let him hold her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t blame you. No one has ever dared to do that to me. Since my life is about to end, this might be the closest interaction that I have ever had with a man.” Shen Huang blushed. She said it very softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart shook. He had even begun to think that he wanted to make Shen Huang his own woman. However, he knew that he mustn’t take advantage of other people’s misfortune. Shen Huang might not reject it if Qing Shui was to suggest something that was over the line. However, Qing Shui was unable to get himself to do that. Doing so would just make him unhappy for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bell for the New Year has rung. It was like the great ball across heaven and earth. The ring from the bell marked that the previous year had ended and a New Year was about to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest Mistress, let’s make some preparations to head off to the Blazing Fire Domain.” Qing Shui said in a firm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui!” Shen Huang was about to say something but stopped halfway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you so good to me? Our relationship isn’t worth for you risk your life like this.” Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you suspecting that I might be thirsting for your body to the point I can even throw away my own life?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You aren’t someone like that. I believe in you.” Shen Huang said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I tell you that I am seeking to get your heart and make you fall for me, will you believe me?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then do you love me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “I don’t!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are a player. You have many wives, and every one of them is beauties that can topple over cities. But for some reason, I just can't get myself to hate you. Even as a woman, I don’t have any friends, not to mention men. I can't help but feel that I am a failure?” Shen Huang laughed as she made fun of herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that Shen Huang was a very lonely person. She had no relatives and friends. He couldn't imagine how she lived her life. The only thing she had left was her subordinates. There were many things which she could get others to do for her. It was not that she didn’t try to interact with anyone, nor was it that there was no one who wanted to be her friends. The problem was the people, who got close to her, had agendas. Thus, she never viewed them as real friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who said that you are alone? Don’t you consider me as a friend of yours?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. You are my friend. I have already treated you as one since a long time ago. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come looking for you to celebrate my New Year, and I also wouldn’t have found you at a time like this.” Shen Huang muttered a few words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, let’s head off to the Blazing Fire Domain.” Qing Shui told Big Tiger that he would be leaving for a while and requested him to say hi to Yu Xixuan on his account after New Year. He also said that he would be back within a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After packing some stuff, Qing Shui gazed at the fireworks in the sky before he grabbed Shen Huang and vanished immediately. The Nine Continents Step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Step a few times in a row. From the map, he could tell that the Blazing Fire Domain was located very far away from the Northern Blue Domain. If he was to rush his way there, it would take quite a long time even with the Nine Continents Step. Shen Huang had less than a few days left to live, thus, Qing Shui immediately marked a location close to the Blazing Fire Domain with his Five Elements Space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moving on, Qing Shui brought Shen Huang along and instantly arrived at that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were standing in mid-air and they could already see the Blazing Fire Domain from there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang gave Qing Shui a blank look. She didn’t know how this man managed to pull it off. To think that he was able to arrive at the edge of the Blazing Fire Domain immediately… Despite all of that, she didn’t question him about it. There were too many mysteries in this world, she didn’t find it to be too unacceptable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Fire Domain was a symbolic place. Just like the Northern Blue Domain, the Blazing Fire Domain was also a location. The temperature here was very high, even higher than the deserts in his previous incarnation. However, there were still a huge amount of people who had gotten used to living here. Added on that the people here had great physiques, it was not likely for them to feel unwell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The environment here was beautiful. A lot of the trees here were like the maple leaves from his previous incarnation except they looked more red and fresh. Their daytime was longer than usual, and the sun was unusually hot. But the good thing was, it rained quite often around this place. There was no way they could stand three days without rain. There would be drizzles every day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Shui and Shen Huang appeared inside the Blazing Fire Domain. Qing Shui didn’t know what city in the Blazing Fire Domain he was in, but he could see that the place was drizzling with rain at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, they were still high up in the air. Qing Shui immediately summoned Little Rin. For the time being, Little Rin was the fastest demonic beast in Qing Shui’s arsenal. Thus, he rode on Little Rin along with Shen Huang as they made their way to the Blazing Fire Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The closer they got to the Blazing Fire Domain, the higher the air temperature became. This was very obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang’s expression looked heavy. It was the Blazing Fire Domain they were talking about, which was significantly more dangerous than Northern Blue Domain. Furthermore, this place was already inside the True Nine Continents World. The Blazing Fire Domain, in particular, was the habitat for a lot of strong demonic beasts. The Blaze Moth was just one of them. Though the Blaze Moth was a rare species, it was undeniably a powerful Spiritual Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Fire Domain was distanced quite far away from here. Even with Little Rin’s speed, it would take about half a day for them to only arrive at the border of the Blazing Fire Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Fire Domain might be a dangerous place, but it was a heaven for adventurers. A lot of people would travel there to explore the area. They would either end up on the edge of the border or go deeper into it. Given that it was an adventure, it meant that the people were putting their own life on the line. There were a lot of explorers in this world, and many also managed to earn their fortunes from it. It applied to everyone, which included even the most ordinary people, they would also have the desire to take risks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people might run into lucky encounters and skyrocket their ranks ever since, but even more people died before they even managed to come across that. There was a popular saying ‘If one often walks by the riverside, there is bound to be a time when he will get his shoes wet’. Thus, some people died on their first adventure while there were some who might perish only after a year, ten, or a hundred years. Of course, there would also be people who spent their entire life going on adventures yet still managed to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he got closer to the Blazing Fire Domain, he noticed that the flying beasts across the sky were also gradually increasing. There were a lot of people in groups traveling back and forth the sky on their Flying Beasts. But most of them would choose to turn back as soon as they saw Qing Shui’s Little Rin. A lot of people would be shocked just by looking at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know if this was a wise idea. Maybe it wouldn’t be long until people discovered that a man and a woman had appeared in the sky riding on a fearsome demonic beast.</span></p>

He feared that doing so might cause Shen Huang to lose her best opportunity to get her illness cured. If that really happened, he would regret it for life.</span></p>

He was willing to risk everything to save her. Previously, there was a time when he had rescued her before. In that sense, he could be considered the person who gave her a second chance to live. Now, he was reluctant to see her disappear right in front of him. He had a feeling that her life, or even her entire character, might be closely related to himself, and that he would feel depressed if she was to vanish like that.</span></p>

It was indescribably painful to part ways with the people whom you loved dearly. One would naturally feel very painful seeing the person whom they were familiar with dying and exited from their life permanently. Qing Shui was a formidable physician. All along, he had often thought that there were no diseases which he couldn’t cure. However, the Black Ice Poison was too violent. Until now, Qing Shui could only come up with two methods, the first one was to look for the cores of Blaze Moths and suppressed the poison in her body with the heart of fire. With Qing Shui’s medical skills, this method had a 100% success rate.</span></p>

However, the success rate for this method was only 50%.</span></p>

It was just that he wouldn’t want to use it unless the situation was really urgent and he needed a last resort. Since Qing Shui possessed the Nine Yang Body, he could actually help Shen Huang nullify her poison by making love to her. Furthermore, there was a high chance that this might actually happen. However, this was a method which Qing Shui would only reserve as a last resort.</span></p>
