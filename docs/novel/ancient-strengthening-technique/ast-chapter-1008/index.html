 <p><strong>AST 1008 - Giant Beasts Mountains, Refining Demons, Cultivating, Horrifying Berserk Dragon</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Luan Luan were wandering around the Giant Beasts Mountains randomly, their goal was to find a suitable beast to battle. The battle could be for Luan Luan or Qing Shui depending on the suitability and strength of the beast. If it was not fitting for either of them, they would leave or run away. Since it was the Giant Beasts Mountains, anything could appear.</p>
 <p>After killing the beast, Qing Shui would cast Refining Demons immediately. Refining Demons was best when the body temperature of the demon was still warm since it created a higher probability of gaining the Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl.</p>
 <p>Setting a formation was for the safety of the two of them and battling was for gaining real combat experience. Combat was the best way to raise one’s strength, thus Qing Shui and Luan Luan passed each day in battles.</p>
 <p>Refining Demons after the battle is over produced mostly Crystal Cards and other items. These items could increase attack by 20% or speed and whatnot. The effects were decent since these Crystal Cards were produced from beasts at strength of two thousand stars. Up until this point, no Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl had been produced.</p>
 <p>This was also normal. Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl was a very rare item that was a condensed form of Essence gathered within the beast’s body. It could only be used by beasts; thus, it was a favourite item amongst Beast Tamers and those who own beasts.</p>
 <p>In one day’s time, Luan Luan had become excited. She could clearly feel the growth in herself. It was not a change in strength but rather in her lethality. It was like a person who had been cutting with the back of the knife but suddenly allowing them slice with the blade. Using the same strength but the feeling would be very different.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan was feeling this right now. It was a realm that could allow one to use their strength like a blade, she seemed to have touched the threshold. Every day she was developing and Qing Shui was a witness to her growth. If it was not a matter of life and death, he would not aid her, even if she was injured.</p>
 <p>He did not want Luan Luan to develop a habit where she would never experience death and expect that each time there was danger, Qing Shui would immediately appear in front of her. The result of this habit would be fatal for her in the future.</p>
 <p>The days went by.</p>
 <p>It could be said that Luan Luan had gotten injured every day but Qing Shui would only heal her injuries after her battles were done. Luan Luan was excited, the fire in her eyes was like the flames of war.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would also battle but the times he battled were far fewer than Luan Luan. Most of his time was spent on Refining Beasts. From the second day onwards, Qing Shui had almost gotten one Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl every two days. If he had better luck, he would get one a day. One of those days, he had gotten three, which made him overcome with joy.</p>
 <p>All the beasts they were fighting had strength between 2000 to 6000 stars. Anything above four thousand stars would be handled by Qing Shui, the others were dealt with by Luan Luan and her beasts.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl from beasts that were 2000 stars in strength had a chance to raise a beast’s strength by 20 stars. Crystal cards could buff the original strength by 20%. It can only be used with one attribute, like power, speed, penetration or poison… … 3000 stars would receive a buff of about 30 stars and so on… Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl was also restricted in the amount that could be consumed. Consumption of Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl was restricted to two per stage.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui released his own beasts to form the Four Symbols Formation for battle. To train his own strength while battling was not only effective for</p>
 <p>Massacre!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Luan Luan brought the beasts to Giant Beasts Mountains to begin a difficult slaughter. At the same time, they also gathered materials and rare objects from the beasts. In addition, Qing Shui had the ridiculous Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Compared to the Interspatial Silk Sachet, the difference was like heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used up beast material at a terrifying speed. Using them for Drawing, Talisman Drawing, Refining Beasts, Formation Flags for setting formations, etc… … Even for making bone soup he would use the best Beast Bones.</p>
 <p>Demonic beast’s cores were Fire Bird and Demonic Spider’s favourite food…</p>
 <p>As everyone concentrated on certain things, time went by quickly. Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl produced from Refining Demons was fed to suitable beasts immediately. In the subsequent battle, it would be digested quickly, which would better allow them to absorb the benefits.</p>
 <p>Berserk Dragon!</p>
 <p>After forty days, Qing Shui could see a beast in the distance, a giant, Berserk Dragon!</p>
 <p>Berserk Dragon was not a dragon, it was closer to a Jiao or Earth Dragon Beast. The Blood of Dragons ran through its veins.</p>
 <p>But the Berserk Dragon in front of them was clearly stronger than any Earth Dragon Beast or Golden Jiao King. Even the Golden-Back Giant Crocodile Emperor could not compare.</p>
 <p>Berserk Dragon had the head of a Jiao, body of a lion, tail of a snake and a giant body that had a length of two hundred meters when measured with its tail. When it came to its giant tail, it looked like a giant python. Its body was tall and sturdy like a small mountain. Its Jiao head puffed out a breath that was three meters long. Its two eyes were the size of two giant water jars, it was as bright as two giant fireballs.</p>
 <p>Its entire body let off a violent energy, its giant tail continuously twisted and turned. Its movement had a rhythm that could not be described with words. The scales on its body let off a light violet aura, like battle armor similar to that of the giant metal beast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Luan Luan were both wearing Battle Armor and Battle Dress made from the hide on the back of the Golden-Back Giant Crocodile Emperor. Qing Shui did not dare be careless now. Qing Shui felt that this beast could release a power that was not less than ten thousand stars in strength.</p>
 <p>Formidable. Qing Shui let Luan Luan watch from the distance, then set the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation. If the situation changed, he would make Luan Luan go inside the formation. He slowly allowed the Berserk Dragon to approach.</p>
 <p>At this time, Qing Shui had only used Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl to raise the strength of Thunderous Beast and Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Since Thunderous Beast had only been at ten stars, he spent the extra effort to finally get it to 25 stars. Its strength was too weak, Qing Shui did not dare feed it the Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearls that were too powerful.</p>
 <p>Upon reaching 20 stars, Violet Thunder Protection leveled up. It increased from the original doubling in strength to tripling. Until it reached 25 stars, Qing Shui finally let out a breath of relief. He directly fed the Thunderous Beast two Hallow Pills. Violet Thunder Protection immediately powered up to now having quintuple effect on strength. Each Hallow Pill had powered up Violet Thunder Protection once.</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast could become so formidable, Qing Shui was not overly surprised. Even if Thunderous Beast was not a mythical existence, it was still a scary existence because of its ability to crowd control.</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast’s strength was already 225 stars!</p>
 <p>Violet Thunder Protection: The Thunderous Beast’s unique ability that activates automatically to quintuple its strength with zero energy consumption. When the Thunderous Beast is under physical attack, it has a chance to paralyze the enemy. At the same time, it can reduce the enemy’s attack by 20%.</p>
 <p>“Not bad, to reduce an enemy’s attack power by 20%. It was still a reactive technique but with zero energy consumption, the stronger it gets the more powerful it becomes.”</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt: A thunder attack emitted from the beast’s core, with an 800 meter attack range. The attack causes a slight Paralysis effect as well as Deceleration and Reaction Delay debuffs. These effects are stackable.</p>
 <p>The range increased by 300 meters from the last power up, this was also normal. Formidable beasts were all like small mountains that could been seen clearly from several thousand meters out.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike: Harnesses the core’s power and releases a powerful lightning strike to disable the opponent. It has a one hundred percent chance to paralyze the enemy, with the length of the paralysis depending on the opponent’s abilities. This skill can only be used every twenty four hours.</p>
 <p>Lightning Recovery: The Thunderous Beast grew up in the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, harnessing an extremely powerful self-recovery ability. Using Lightning Recovery, the Thunderous Beast can immediately heal 70% of the injuries on its body. Its natural restoration speed will also increase by tenfold for an hour. After two uses, the cool down time will be two hours.</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast was a control type, its attack power was not comparable to those of the same level. However, it could restrict the movement of an opponent. If it was paired with another beast or a martial artist, it would lead to better results which could even overturn a dire situation.</p>
 <p>This time the haul was decent but was barely enough. A beating that had to be endured. However, Diamond Gigantic Elephant had raised its original strength of 230 stars to 300 stars.</p>
 <p>Risen by 70 stars already. Qing Shui had the Origin Essence Soul Pearl that could raise its strength by another 60 stars but using it on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was too dangerous. Thus, it should only be used on beasts with at least 2000 stars’ strength. He would have to save the higher-level ones for later use.</p>
 <p>Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s increase in strength could benefit Qing Shui in many ways. Unfortunately, Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s buff increased from 10% to 20% and would not increase by much anymore.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had always wanted the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s strength to increase, since it provided him with many benefits. The other one he wanted to rise in strength was the Spirited Snake Turtle.</p>
 <p>In between, he had allowed the Spirited Snake Turtle to increase in strength by 40 stars. Rising in strength required time. Beasts eating pills or other items required a bit of transition time.</p>
 <p>Right now, the Spirited Snake Turtle’s strength had already reached 340 stars. After a while, the Spirited Snake Turtle had only reached 1360 stars of strength, Qing Shui still wanted to raise its strength. He wished that Area Dominance could power up once more. This would provide additional assurance to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>To raise his strength to its peak, seeing the Berserk Dragon in the distance, Qing Shui thought about battling the Berserk Dragon as a challenge to himself. The beasts here were not as strong as the Seven-headed Scarlet Serpent from the Sacred Land of Panacea. That area was not limited by any restrictions but this area was restricted.</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the skill that came from the Spirited Snake Turtle at the peak of his strength, at the same time, he cast the Descending Heavens Talisman towards the Berserk Dragon.</p>
 <p>Five hundred fifty!</p>
 <p>Descending Heavens Talisman had directly debuffed its strength by 550 stars.</p>
 <p>Eleven thousand stars in strength!</p>
 <p>If the Berserk Dragon’s strength was not bound by the laws of heaven and earth, had it been in the other four continents or Sacred Land of Panacea, its strength would have been 65000 stars.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A huge roar that shook the core of people’s souls. Two huge eyes locked onto Qing Shui. With a body like that of a small hill, its movement was strangely coordinated. Once it began to move, it became as vigorous as a soaring dragon and as active as a leaping tiger. Its huge tail swept over.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not dare be careless, he immediately used his trump card.</p>
 <p>Directly resulting in a debuff of two thousand two hundred stars.</p>
 <p>Berserk Dragon Beast still had the strength of 8200 stars remaining!</p>
 <p>His heart felt a bit more at ease, at least right now there was a chance to fight back. Although Qing Shui’s strength was just under 7000 stars, he still had Nine Palace Steps. More importantly, his Big Dipper Sword had a 20% chance to do bonus damage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already aware that even if he struck with double damage, it would still only be 7900 stars in power. It was not even 8000 stars in strength. The debuffed Berserk Dragon Beast still had 8200 stars left.</p>
 <p>“Mn, Crystal Card, how could I forget about this!”</p>
