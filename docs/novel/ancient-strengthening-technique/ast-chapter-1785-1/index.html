Smoke and dust filled up the place. There was fog formed in the atmosphere and agonizing cries coming from the beast rides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a big palm imprint, the area in the center of the group was completely destroyed. Although not many of them were hurt, they were all rendered in a pathetic state. Earlier on, with just a glance, Qing Shui got an estimation of their abilities and thus he knew that his attack could reach this effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Astonishing impact. This was what he was striving for. He wanted his opponents to know that they were weak and useless before him and in the future, if they wished to deal with him, they should remember the scene today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although most of the people darted away in a pathetic state, there were also quite a number of them who were injured. There were also a number of them who had light injuries. All of them turned pale as they looked at this young man in great disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were also a few people who didn't move in the slightest The powerful Qi force didn't astonish them and right now, they were also looking at Qing Shui with a grim countenance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the few people who were perfectly fine. Two of them looked like elderly people wearing black robes that were embroidered with a sharp saber. There were also two men who appeared to be middle-aged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man in the middle appeared refined, had a tall and slender figure with broad shoulders. His upright figure wouldn't lose out to any young men. Time hadn't left much traces on his mature face and his eyes were bright yet filled with determination and dignity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't that Qing Shui didn't want to hurt them, but he knew that if he did, there would definitely be a lot of people losing their lives. Qing Shui didn't want to kill. It wasn't because he was showing them pity, but he wanted to see if these people would persist to the very end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you need me to request for you guys to come down again?" Qing Shui smiled as he looked at the remaining few people in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That earlier strike had already brought down quite a large number of them and only a few of them still remained standing in the air. Qing Shui didn't like to look at people while raising his head. He smiled coldly and disdainfully toward the people who were up there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why are you going against our Heavenly Saber Manor?" That refined middle-aged man didn't come down but merely asked as he lowered his head and looked at Qing Shui and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't say a word and struck out once again. This time around, it was with an impact that was several times stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground shook and the mountains trembled. Now, not a single person remained in the air. Qing Shui looked at the huge crater before him, where the few people were at and said, "How does it feel?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For one to put up a front, they needed to be strong. Otherwise, it would just be a joke!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The few men's faces instantly changed, with most of them feeling anxious. Offending strong experts and their dignities would easily cause them their deaths. Earlier on, their actions were already considered as an offense and he had all the right to kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more they thought about it, the more afraid they were. They remained standing in the huge crater, even forgetting about getting out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Speak up. Who are you guys in the Heavenly Saber Manor? If the head of the Heavenly Saber Manor isn't here, then you guys can just commit suicide." Qing Shui now felt a little more at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm the head of the Heavenly Saber Manor. These few people are the Custodians. Mister Qing, may I ask why you've called for me?" That refined middle-aged man lowered his attitude and said, while bowing slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was satisfied with their performance. However, when he heard what this man said, he frowned. With just these few words alone, he could tell that this refined man wasn't anyone good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, it wasn't strange for them to know who he was. The people who had left previously should have already told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you really not know why I've asked you to come?" Qing Shui said. He was displeased. His expression turned cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sigh, Mister Qing should know that our Heavenly Saber Manor don't involve ourselves with the matter of this world. We're also forced to do something like this. To ensure that our sect isn't wiped out, I can only follow the orders of someone else." The Heavenly Saber Manor's head sighed and said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kept his eyes on the head of the Heavenly Saber Manor, especially on his expression and what he was feeling when he spoke. Qing Shui felt the helplessness the man felt when he was saying this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're at Peak Grade False God, being only one step away from the Divine Grade. Why are you following someone’s orders?" Qing Shui felt curious. Who was the one behind all of this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qing Shui asked, his thoughts were already moving. Right now, his women were all at the Dancing Phoenix Continent and although the place was a little further from here, it was hard to say if only the Dancing Phoenix Continent was affected by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I only know that this organization is known as the Phoenix God Organization. I don't know anything else. What they want to do is to bring together the powers of the entire Dancing Phoenix Continent, so that they can go up against the other continents in the future." The head of the Heavenly Saber Manor shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What position are you in this Phoenix God Organization?" Qing Shui continued to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm only one of the 100 sects under the Phoenix God Organization and acting on their instructions." The head of the Heavenly Saber Manor looked at Qing Shui, as if he had thought of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister Qing, there'll probably be someone looking for you very soon. My level isn't high enough." the man continued to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Qing Shui felt less worried. He had heard before that there was going to be a Grand War of the Nine Continents and when the time came, all nine continents would be involved. It seemed like this had turned out to be true and there were already signs of this happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't that there were signs showing that such a thing would be happening. Only that he was already strong enough to come into contact with things of this level. Not everyone would be involved in the battle. It would only be amongst the top level warriors and should be something that had always been on-going. It was only now that Qing Shui came into contact with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his current powers, they probably won't raise their hands against his friends or family. At the very least, before they deal with him they wouldn't be so foolish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's actually not a bad thing to join this Phoenix God Organization. The name of your sect or clan won't change and you won't have to do anything for most of the time. The organization is very lively and you'll be able to come into contact with many people. It's a good opportunity and you'll also receive good resources. Of course, the benefits aren't for free. You must do things for the Phoenix God Organization and must also listen to their commands in periods of emergency."</span></p>

This was normal. There were two groups of people in the world of martial arts. The first type would be those who were headstrong and would never stoop to flattery or bow down toward others. Although these people were tough, they could be easily broken as well. Those who could allow themselves to fawn on others would easily stop in their own progress.</span></p>

This was why Qing Shui had agreed to let them off. Everything was attributed to the differences in their abilities, just like how it was for jealousy. When the gap between the two people was too big, there won't be any jealousy. There would only be admiration.</span></p>
