 <p><strong>AST 1094 - Dragon Qi’s Massive Effect, Laying the Foundation</strong></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui felt that most of the demonic beasts strength increase by one fold. This precious Dragon Qi did not just increase their strength by onefold, its main effect was that it could change the constitution of someone, regardless of whether they were beast or human. Being able to increase their strength by onefold was the current benefit, while the other benefits were expected to be in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was almost time, so Qing Shui decided to rest right there. Although trouble had been stirred up in this exact location, Qing Shui was not worried that people would come to cause more trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span>Many beasts were released outside. Qing Shui had only kept two hundred Jade Emperor Bees that had not absorbed any Dragon Qi. Luckily, this place was the Land of Dragon Qi. He could leave the Jade Emperor Bees outside as warning alarms while letting them absorb the residual Dragon Qi in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span>After Qing Shui greeted several of the women, many of them sought a place to absorb and appreciate the changes in their constitutions. Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal covertly.</span></p>
 <p><span>He had taken too much time before finally entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, Qing Shui was happy. Even if he was unable to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for several consecutive dayshe would still be happy.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui felt that it was a pity that many people close to him did not have the opportunity to absorb the Dragon Qi. On the other hand, these things occurred by chance and many of those close to him had also received the benefits. It was more than enough that none of the Dragon Qi had been wasted. If only his demonic beast and himself absorbed the Dragon Qi, it would have been a waste of good resources.</span></p>
 <p><span>In general, the result this time was good. Looking at the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, it had received the most benefits. It was probably due to its Dragon Bloodline. After all, when it evolved into the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the Dragon Bloodline within its constitution had become more formidable compared to before.</span></p>
 <p><span>Its physical strength grew rapidly from 800 stars to 3000 stars, making Qing Shui feel inwardly invigorated. This was the result of directly receiving the benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dragon Elephant Force: passive combat ability, permanently increases strength by tenfolds.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dragon Elephant Force had powered up and it was a power up of several grades. This was the effect of Dragon Qi. It was like having the right medicine prescribed for an illness. At this moment, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s power grew swiftly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui quickly checked the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s abilities. Many of them had changed and grown stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span>Mighty Dragon Elephant’s Recklessness: Increases attacks by threefolds, randomly attacking at most twenty targets.</span></p>
 <p><span>Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp, Grand Perfection Stage, Tenfold increase in physical strength and offensive power. A certain chance in paralyzing the opponent’s limbs, immobilizing them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion: An instantaneous leap within a distance of 2000 meters!</span></p>
 <p><span>Diamond Sword Qi: Spits out a wave of Core Qi to attack the opponent. Possesses a formidable attack power. It can reduce a target’s speed by 20% and its effect lasts for two hours.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The distance improved greatly and its self-protection ability became stronger! Diamond Sword Qi’s duration became longer, the number of attack targets and the attack power also increased.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Vajra Subdues Demons: Lowers the strengths of multiple targets by 10% within a radius of 1000 meters after casting. Number of targets cannot exceed fifty. Effect lasts for two hours!</span></p>
 <p><span>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack: Launches an attack at one target in an instant. Can raise offensive power by four folds!</span></p>
 <p><span>Dark Infernal Flames and Mighty Dragon Elephant Armor had no changes. Although no changes occurred to the ability, since the physical strength of the elephant became stronger, the ability would be stronger regardless.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant cast the Ferocious Diamond Attack, it could reach a strength of 150,000 stars. Furthermore, similar to how the Spirit Gathering Lamp works, the Heaven Shaking Drum from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal could now provide a one fold boost to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s attack power. One increased a demonic beast’s spirit energy while the other increased a beast’s physical attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span>Therefore, Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant could cast out a strength of 300,000 stars. Unfortunately, this location was bounded by the Laws of Heaven and Earth, thus the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s max strength was capped at approximately 40,000 stars.</span></p>
 <p><span>Afterwards, Qing Shui took a look at Fire Bird and Five-headed Demonic Spider, or more precisely, the Six-Headed Demonic Spider. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider evolved into a Six-Headed beast. Its strength had also increased significantly.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the Fire Bird’s increase was worst when compared to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. From this, it could be seen that Dragon Qi was more suitable for the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Fire Bird’s physical strength had reached 1500 stars, exactly one fold less than the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens: passive combat ability, zero energy consumption, permanently increases physical strength by seven times. All combat abilities performed would have their energy consumption reduced by half!</span></p>
 <p><span>Even in the aspect of combat abilities, it had not increased to the degree of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</span></p>
 <p><span>Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens: When the Fire Bird performs the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens, the damage inflicted by its flames attacks would increase by many folds. It can be sustained for 30 minutes and it can be used four times daily. During this period, all damage received would be reduced.</span></p>
 <p><span>The others had no change, nor had the appearance changed like the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Compared to before, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had become more majestic, the scales on its body had toughened while its vicious aura had increased by several folds. &nbsp;It no longer had its previous simple and honest appearance. It was more like a ferocious beast.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
 <p><span>O</span><span>n the other hand, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider had gained an extra giant hideous head. This head was more ferocious than the others and its color carried a hint of gold and the location of the head was in the middle, which surprised Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Six-Headed Demonic Spider’s current physical strength was equivalent to Fire Bird, reaching a strength of 1500 stars. This surprised Qing Shui. This was likely due to the Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s sudden breakthrough, otherwise, it would not be so strong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Five Qi Origin: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider's innate battle technique, permanently increases its physical strength by six folds and has zero energy consumption.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing the change in the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the Fire Bird, the Six-Headed Demonic Spider’s growth felt a little pitiful. Even though Qing Shui knew that it was nothing worth pitying about since the Six-Headed Demonic Spider was already a mutated beast of Heaven and Earth—the Emperor of Demonic Spiders.</span></p>
 <p><span>Poison Silk Entanglement: The Five-Headed Demonic Spider can fire a thread of poison silk within a range of 800 meters, attacking and entangling the target. Its speed is very fast and it is highly toxic and sticky.</span></p>
 <p><span>Flying Spider Silk: After using this, its speed will increase by five times. This skill will last for seven and a half minutes. It can be used once every day.</span></p>
 <p><span>The other abilities had not changed. However, at the very bottom, Qing Shui noticed a new combat ability.</span></p>
 <p><span>Demonic Spider Golden Armor: Increased the strength and sharpness of the Six-Headed Demonic Spider’s body by one fold. The toughness, stickiness and toxicity of the Six-Headed Demonic Spider’s silk are also increased by one fold. Furthermore, endurance and durability are both enhanced by one fold.</span></p>
 <p><span>After Qing Shui saw the last ability, he understood that the Six-Headed Demonic Spider had become formidable. After absorbing the Dragon Qi, its constitution had morphed wholly. It could now be considered one of Qing Shui’s formidable crowd control beasts. It could be paired with the Thunderous Beast, playing as a part of his battle force.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable’s physical strength had almost doubled. It was now at the strength of 500 stars, though its body was about a meter in length. It seemed to have gained more spiritual intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Five Colored Poison Passive: Increases physical strength and its venomous nature by five folds, passive combat ability with zero energy consumption.</span></p>
 <p><span>Five Colored Poison: Venomous Five Colored Poison will be released together during attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Spiritual Sensitivity: Increases speed by five folds, passive combat ability with zero energy consumption.</span></p>
 <p><span>Its strength had been increased significantly. This time, its capabilities had become quite formidable.</span></p>
 <p><span>Once Qing Shui glanced over at Thunderous Beast and he could not help but laugh. He had never thought that the Thunderous Beast would give him such a surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span>Physical Strength of 2000 stars!</span></p>
 <p><span>Violet Thunder Protection: The Thunderous Beast’s unique ability that activates automatically. This ability increases its strength by eight folds with zero energy consumption. When the Thunderous Beast is under a physical attack, it has a chance to paralyze the enemy. At the same time, it can reduce the enemy’s attack power by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span>Violet Lightning Strike: Harnesses the core’s power and releases a powerful lightning strike to disable the opponent, resulting in an attack with four fold strength. It has a 100% chance to paralyze the enemy, with the length of the paralysis depending on the opponent’s abilities. This skill can be used four times every twenty four hours.</span></p>
 <p><span>Violet Lightning Armor: Battle Armor formed from condensed Violet Lightning. Can withstand 40% of physical and spiritual attacks!</span></p>
 <p><span>Thunder Flash: Passive ability, permanently increase speed by six folds.</span></p>
 <p><span>In addition to these enhancements, the others had no change. The Thunderous Beast’s strength was in its speed and resistance, being able to resist 60% of all attacks. Thunderous Beast was a crowd control type beast and even though its attack was lacking, its resistance was strong. The lack of attack was relative. The Thunderous Beast was a legendary existence, it could possibly evolve into a legendary beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>Further down, Qing Shui saw that the Thunderous Beast gained a new battle ability. His heart began to race.</span></p>
 <p><span>Mutual Destruction: Inflicts 80% of total health and damages itself in exchange for 80% damage to the opposition. Damage is mutual, that is, using a frightening attack to inflict damage to the opponent resulting in damage on the opponent as well as itself. Mutual Destruction cannot directly take the life of the target.</span></p>
 <p><span>It could only be used once a month! If the disparity in strength was too great, the success rate would be very low!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui laughed after seeing this skill. It was too frightening. Instantaneously causing 80% damage to the target and itself. 80% damage would basically result in movement problems for the target.</span></p>
 <p><span>Had this been any other beast, this ability would only be used in a dire situation without much effect. However, the Thunderous Beast was an exception to this. This was because the Thunderous Beast had the godly skill Lightning Recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lightning Recovery: The Thunderous Beast grew up in the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, harnessing an extremely powerful self-recovery ability. Using the Lightning Recovery, the Thunderous Beast can immediately heal 70% of the injuries on its body. Its natural restoration speed will also increase by tenfold for an hour. After two uses, the cooldown time will be two hours.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Spirited Snake Turtle’s had also experienced great changes, even its appearance seemed to have changed a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span>Its physical strength had reached 500 stars!</span></p>
 <p><span>Spirited Snake Turtle: Spiritual Type of Heaven and Earth, Ancient Bloodline, with natural Area Dominance. 30% reduction in its owner's spirit energy consumption and 20% reduction in spirit energy damaged received.</span></p>
 <p><span>Spirited Snake Movement: Increase physical strength by five folds.</span></p>
 <p><span>Area Dominance: third grade, within a kilometer radius, Spiritual Pressure of Heaven and Earth, atmospheric pressure, deterrence, seal, toxic venom are negated ……this effect is directly related to the master’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>Area Dominance was already at the third grade. Now, Qing Shui placed particular emphasis on Area Dominance’s other effects. Negating the Laws of Heaven and Earth did not excite him, he already had the Arhat Rosary Beads.</span></p>
 <p><span>His own beast had become formidable. Yiye Jiange and the other women also benefitted greatly. However, only the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast, the Six-Headed Windfire Wolf, and the other later tamed beasts were formidable enough. Qing Shui’s tamed beasts were beginning to strengthen, especially the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</span></p>
 <p><span>Under the effect of Spirit Gathering Lamp and Heaven Shaking Drum, his beasts could be considered powerful. However, given the Laws of Heaven and Earth on the Five Continents, the difference was very small.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the direct benefit of absorbing Dragon Qi. After being bathed in Dragon Qi, one’s strength would increase at a faster rate than before. Of course, the Golden Scale Dragon Elephant’s strength would increase the fastest.</span></p>
