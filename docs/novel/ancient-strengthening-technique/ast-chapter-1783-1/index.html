People said that one who was skilled was generally bold. Only those with power wouldn't be afraid of such issues. Therefore, he felt that he could easily solve this issue without problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of this made him feel more relaxed. This world had never been peaceful before, there would be many great battles happening around on a daily basis and it wasn't a rare sight. Where there were humans, there would be fights. In this world, there weren't just battles between humans, but also between demonic beasts and similar existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The action from the</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly Saber Manor previously didn't come to spoil everyone's mood. They sat together to chat about rare occurrences in the world as they drank wine. However, it was only between Qing Shui, Soul Search, and Puyang Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange, Li Ji, and Li Yan sat together and talked about some other topics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Old Master, has everything been well at home?" Qing Shui put down his wine cup and asked, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's good. How has it been for you over these years?" Puyang Qing was a little curious. He had no idea what level Qing Shui was current at. Over the years, he had also gotten a lot stronger. Back then, he had become a False God cultivator with Qing Shui's help. However, he knew that in this life, he was basically going to stop at the False God realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puyang Qing wasn't aware that Qing Shui was now a Divinity. If he knew, he would be completely shocked. Of course, he had no idea how strong Yiye Jiange was either. This divine beauty looked just like an ordinary person as she carried a child. In fact, she was also a Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've been in the ocean domain with Jiange all these years and haven't been able to leave since then. I only managed to free myself two days ago and rushed back home to take a look." Qing Shui also felt that he was quite lucky, to be encountering such things the moment he came back. He could help to solve their problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't reveal too much about his clan. In fact, the few ladies at home would also be able to handle the Heavenly Saber Manor, if there were no influences that were especially terrifying backing them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You haven't had the chance to head home yet, right?" Puyang Qing also felt that he was especially fortunate. Good fortune could change a person's life and many other things as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We've just arrived. This is good too. I hope that the leader of the Heavenly Saber Manor would be able to come on that day. Otherwise, we'll head there to take a look. If he really is a person of great evils, then we'll just kill him. Otherwise, it'd continue to be a burden in our hearts." Qing Shui said after gave it some thought, as he won't leave future troubles for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"With Tian Jiu dead, even if the head of the Heavenly Saber Manor doesn't come, other people would."</span></p>

As long as they dare to come and create trouble, I'll make them stay here forever."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had promised her earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sister Jiange, I'll be heading over first." Li Yan smiled and said to Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Go on. Treating injuries are more important." Yiye Jiange nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui realized that he was a little agitated to be alone with Li Yan. It should be agitation, one that was hidden deep in one's heart. In his previous life, there had been nothing between them and they didn't become a couple. They had their own lives and Qing Shui also had his own difficulties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was an inextinguishable feeling in his heart. Even till now, he would still occasionally think about it. Sometimes, he would even wonder if Li Yan's appearance this time was so that he could calm the regret in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sir!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was "woken up" by Li Yan. She was puzzled by Qing Shui, as he had been staring at her in a daze. She didn't understand why he would look at her with such a gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a gaze filled with yearning, regret, love, and something she couldn't put into words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're thinking about her again? Seems like I really look a lot like her then." Li Yan smiled softly and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Almost exactly the same, even in terms of character and voice." Qing Shui didn't deny and shook his head, smiling bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You love her a lot." Li Yan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I do, I love her a lot. It has been several decades but I still can't forget about her. The two of us aren't lovers. I like her a lot, but I don't even know if she likes me." Qing Shui shook his head and said bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was until now that he could say the words that had been buried in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the first girl whom Qing Shui had truly fallen in love with. Although their relationship wasn't the closest, she was the most unique one and he would be willing to give up many girls for her sake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Yan was stunned. She found it hard to imagine that the girl whom he liked, was the one he had a one-sided love with. Moreover, that girl was exactly like herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"She left you." Li Yan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"She left me forever."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Qing Shui was the one who had left, he had left to another world. However, he couldn't say this and could only put things this way. He had been given another life and the memories... The beautiful memories from the past were something he could no longer return to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Have you been treating me like her?" Li Yan asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"When I see you, I'd only be reminded of her. But you are you and I won't treat you as her." Qing Shui shook his head and said smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank you. If you really were to treat me as her, I would have to hide from you in the future." Li Yan smiled and her crescent-shaped eyes looked very beautiful. Qing Shui was moved. It was a familiar feeling, it was linked with the purest memories which he had in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then applied acupuncture for Li Yan. During the acupuncture treatment, he had done it through her clothes. Her injured meridian channels were treated very quickly and were in a better condition than before they were hurt.&nbsp;</span></p>

The treatment hasn't taken a very long time and when they came out, a few more people had arrived. One of them was an exquisite looking girl.</span></p>

The little lass was now at the height of Qing Shui's chest. Girls went through puberty at a younger age and Puyang Zhengming now already had a slender figure.</span></p>

There was a hint of coldness in them but they were gleaming with intelligence, giving off the feeling that she was a very clever person.</span></p>

Puyang Qing said to the lass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Uncle!" &nbsp;Puyang Zhengming walked up next to Puyang Qing and then smiled as she called Qing Shui. Her voice was crisp and her actions were graceful and very earnest.</span></p>

I haven't prepared anything for you. Take this as a present. I'll make it up for you in the future." Qing Shui handed a copy of the Free Spirit Steps and Solitary Rapid Fist to the lass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could tell the lass' aptitude and she wasn't suitable to learn the Ghostly Steps. The Solitary Rapid Fist was a good complementary skill to the Free Spirit Steps and at a later time, she could practice it with the swords. If she could really get together with Qing Long, it wouldn't be bad either.</span></p>

The lass thanked him with grace and smile, revealing two faint dimples.</span></p>

Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange were going to stay, while they waited for the people from the Heavenly Saber Manor to come the next day. They could only head back home after the matters here were settled. Although they were still very far from the Qing Clan, he could still arrive very quickly if he were to use the Nine Continents Steps. However, Qing Shui was afraid that something would happen if he were to leave. After all, he had killed Tian Jiu.</span></p>
