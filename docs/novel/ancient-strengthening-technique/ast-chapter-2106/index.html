 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 2106 - How can you still be so alluring, even without a man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could feel himself sweating. It had been such a long time since a person last called him that. He said a bit nervously, “Ahem, I have heard people claiming that Palace Mistress seems to know a thing or two about the art of healing. I would like to invite you over to the Northern Emperor City to open a clinic with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Nuo Lan looked at Qing Shui curiously, “You also know about the art of healing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded as he saw the woman’s shocked expression, “Yes, I do know a little bit about it. In fact, I have been running my own clinics for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan was unconvinced by Qing Shui’s words. She could have taken it if he had only said that he knew about the art of healing, but to her, it was almost impossible that a Battle God Inheritor would keep running a clinic. Yet now, that was what he was suggesting her to do with him. Thus, for a moment, she was at a loss on whether she should believe him or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you give me a reason why you want to open a clinic? Do you plan to only open it for a short period of time?” Nuo Lan asked after a moment of thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No. The opposite, actually. But usually, when I first opened a clinic, I will stay in that particular area first until I can find someone to take over it. Some of them are my friends, while others are my disciples. In any case, I think it’s safe to assume that I will be staying in the Northern Emperor City for a long period of time.” As Qing Shui was saying this, he started thinking about all of his journeys which had ultimately led up to where he was now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing Qing Shui’s words, Nuo Lan was intrigued. She then nodded, “Alright, opening a clinic with you wouldn’t a problem, but you must show me some of your medical skills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is fine by me. How do you plan on testing my skills?” Qing Shui smiled. It would go well, so long as she agreed to it. After all, it wasn’t an easy task to look for a partner in such a short time, let alone a woman this strong. Thus, he wouldn’t need to worry about a lot of things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t you try to examine my body and see if there are any problems with it?” Nuo Lan spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded and gestured her that he wanted to help her feel her pulse. Without any hesitations, Nuo Lan let out her pale hand for Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui must say that the woman’s body was functioning well. Even though he could still help her remove some of the impurities to enhance the functions of her body and increase her lifespan, since these weren’t obvious, Qing Shui hesitated for a while and eventually answered, “Your body is in good health.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you mean to say that there is nothing wrong with me?” Nuo Lan asked further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you insist on making me point out a problem, it will be your inconsistent menstruation each month. Your Yin-yang Energy is a bit imbalanced.” Qing Shui felt that this was only a minor problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan was surprised. She then glanced at Qing Shui with an unnatural look, “Hmph, not bad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she didn’t consider her problem to be that serious, she had yet to figure out any ways to cure it. Putting aside the physicians capable of healing it, not many people could even tell what her problem was. The reason was that she understood well that depending on the patients themselves, her illness could either be treated easily, or it could also be very tough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have any ways of treating it?” Nuo Lan asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your problem is caused by an imbalance between your Yin and Yang Qi. Your Yang Qi is too concentrated, causing you to have insufficient Yang Qi. There are two ways of solving this, the first method is for you to channel some Yang Qi into your body. Alternatively, you can also release your Yin Qi to balance out the two elements. It seems you may not have enjoyed your life with your husband.” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that she was single. This was her punishment for calling him a little boy back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Nuo Lan was able to interpret Qing Shui’s words. She glared at Qing Shui with an angry look, “Little boy, I am still single.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Nuo Lan in shock, “I didn’t really expect a person to be so alluring even without a man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You damned brat, are you looking for a beating?” It was out of Nuo Lan’s expectations that Qing Shui would say something like this. She must admit that this man looked handsome. He was more of the gentle and reserved type that was worth taking a second look. He was clearly different from the people with baby-looks, and those with masculine built. Instead, he was more like a mixture of those two, having a baby-face while retaining his gentle yet manly look. The combinations of those two had caused him to possess a very unusual kind of temperament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, alright, I am just kidding. Why don’t you follow me and look for a place to open the clinic together?” Qing Shui said in a mischievous tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan didn’t say anything further. She nodded and left with Qing Shui. Before she left, she greeted the people in the shrine. The people inside the shrine were given full freedom to do whatever they wanted. But usually, it would be best if they had a way to communicate with each other. For instance, in the case of people like Qing Shui, he could be located very easily since he was going to run a clinic in the Northern Emperor City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There weren’t many things which Nuo Lan needed to pack. She kept most of the things which she used on a regular basis in her storage type treasures. Not only would they not degenerate, but they would also be untainted by even a speck of dust. Hence, she could head off to wherever she wanted so long as she had that with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know a place that’s suitable for opening a clinic. However, are you confident that you can succeed it with your medical skills?” Nuo Lan stared at Qing Shui. She kept having a feeling that Qing Shui was too young to open a clinic. Furthermore, since he was a Battle God, there was no doubt that he would be strong. Nuo Lan had even begun to sense that she was unable to see through this man. Even a genius would very rarely be able to do two or three things at once. Considering how powerful he was, where could he possibly find the time to practice his medical skills?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan’s medical skills could only be considered decent. She only specialized in certain fields. This was reasonable as she didn’t spend that much time practicing her medical skills, nor was she eager to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that you are still unconvinced with my words. How about this? Once we find a place to settle down, I will have my ways to make you believe me.” Qing Shui knew that it would be very hard for him to come to a mutual agreement with the woman unless he showed her to what extent his medical skills had reached.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great! That’d be perfect.” Nuo Lan said in joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even with that said, Qing Shui wasn’t confident that he could beat her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And this was still under the condition that she still hadn’t unleashed her strength. The charm that merely emitted from her body by accident had already caused Qing Shui to let up his guard, in fear that he might end up embarrassing himself</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Emperor City was the biggest city in Northern Emperor Domain. Various forces dwelled inside this area. A few examples of these were the commoners, members of royal and aristocratic clans, disciples from certain sects, and more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tall buildings made the humans seemed very tiny and insignificant. From time to time, huge beasts could be seen flying over the sky. Usually, these beasts would end up being tamed. Strong demonic beasts, with the exceptions of those that could turn into humans. would rarely appear in places with a lot of humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But beings like the Great Demon wouldn’t just be found everywhere. It only appeared in certain cities, or rather, to be more specific, certain parts within a city. This was a rule that was formed a long time ago. After all, it was nothing if a Great Demon got killed by humans, since this place was a human’s territory, to begin with. However, it would be a great deal if it was a Great Demon who slaughtered humans instead. Thus, it was unlikely that a Great Demon would cause any troubles around a human territory unless it was invincible around the area. But even so, this would only attract even stronger warriors to come and slaughter it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, that’s the one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were at one of the streets that were flourishing inside the Northern Emperor City. Though it was not considered the best one, Qing Shui felt that it should be fine. “Good products sold itself”. By relying on his own strength, he could bring up the reputation of this street.</span></p>

It was only a tiny pavilion that was significantly smaller than the buildings around it. Nevertheless, it was already quite decent.
