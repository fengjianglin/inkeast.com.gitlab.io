 <p><strong>AST 1392 - Devil Suppression Formation, Devil Slaying Golden Lock Formation, Che Clan and Left Custodian </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't too surprised that the Spirit Gathering Lamp had lost its effect. At grade six, the level of the Spirit Gathering Lamp was considered to be too low. Even if it were to increase by one grade, it would be hard for there to be any effect. Although these things were very good, it was too hard to increase their grades.</p>
 <p>This was even when Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Otherwise, even if he had these treasures, there was no way that they could be of any use. This was unless he could find some things which could increase the grade of the treasures directly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was satisfied. In the future, after the Spirit Gathering Lamp leveled up, it could be a huge surprise. Right now, the Fire Bird's strength of 22 million sun was already sufficient to deal with the current situation.</p>
 <p>With a great feeling of surprise and joy, Qing Shui started his cultivation!</p>
 <p>Formations!</p>
 <p>In the previous battle, Qing Shui once again experienced the prowess of formations. If it was a one-on-one fight, formations were not of much use. Qing Shui had the Nine Palace Steps and his family started learning it from a young age. Moreover, all of them learn the same formation as well.</p>
 <p>The Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation!</p>
 <p>The Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation could be adapted into other formations, such as the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Sword Formation. He had taught this formation to them a long time ago, as well as the Five Elements Minor Formation, which was a combination of a confining formation and a killing formation.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui attained a breakthrough to the eighth heavenly layer, he experienced a huge improvement in all areas, including formations. He realized that he could now learn quite a number of formations.</p>
 <p>Devil Suppression Formation, Devil Slaying Golden Lock Formation……</p>
 <p>These formations were all quite good but the prerequisites were very high and they were very strict in positions. Therefore, in order to learn these, there was a need to have a good grasp of time and one must also have considerable cultivation and a powerful brain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could only take a look at them and visualize the implementation in his mind or try to figure it out by himself.</p>
 <p>He continued to cultivate like this, studying some other things, refining demons, tempering when he was taking a rest. Unknowingly, it was time for him to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He had only learned the tip of the iceberg that was these formations but this had already allowed him to feel how powerful these formations were.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had finished the Four-Yang Pills and the people around him could only eat them once a year. It was already a great blessing for one to be able to eat such medicinal pills once a year. There was the Origin Returning Pill as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu had already reached the False God level and thus couldn't use it anymore. It was a pity that they couldn't use such a good medicinal pill. Qing Shui put aside the Four-Yang Pills, Origin Returning Pills and Double Portion Medication he had refined. In the future, the demand for these would be very high.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After just one night, Qing Shui felt as if even the skies appeared to be different now. Right now, he could relax on the highest floor, sipping tea. He didn't worry at all that Che Clan would come to exact revenge and he was even feeling a little expectant.</p>
 <p>Around the Imperial Cuisine Hall, or rather, along the streets where the Imperial Cuisine Hall was located, the traffic flow was over double what it usually was. The restaurants and other places were filled with people.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that Che Clan should already have made their move. Now that things had already reached this stage, there were no other options. Even the Phoenix Dance Organization had to be changed a little.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo sat opposite Qing Shui and drank tea with him.</p>
 <p>"Brother, you aren't worried at all?" Tianhe Renmo looked at Qing Shui, looking unfathomable like a deep swamp or a great ocean. He had no idea what the other was thinking at all. He couldn't sense anything either.</p>
 <p>"Why is there a need to worry? The one who should worry is someone else," Qing Shui smiled and said, feeling extremely relaxed.</p>
 <p>When Tianhe Renmo saw how confident Qing Shui was, he seemed to feel a little more at ease as well. This was a very strange feeling. In the past, he would only feel this way if he was before elders in his clan but that feeling grew increasing faint as time passed. To think that he suddenly had this feeling again.</p>
 <p>Just then, a male attendant from the Imperial Cuisine Hall walked up to them and said, "Physician, someone got me to pass this to you."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had given the instructions earlier for this middle-aged man to handle the trifling issues concerning the Imperial Cuisine Hall. He was considered to be a steward. This person was originally only at Peak Martial King level but after Qing Shui had helped to bring his level up to the Martial Saint level, this man was now completely devoted and loyal to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Who was it?" Qing Shui took it and asked softly.</p>
 <p>"Someone from Linghu Clan," the man said seriously.</p>
 <p>"Alright, I got it. You can help to pay a little more attention."</p>
 <p>The man went down. Qing Shui opened up the beast parchment. After reading it, he immediately handed it to Tianhe Renmo. This was a letter that Linghu Yu had given him.</p>
 <p>It wrote that the Phoenix Dance Organization's Left Custodian had disappeared and Cloud Flutter Organization might not be able to stop them and that Qing Shui should be careful. Linghu Clan and the Left Custodian's status differed by a lot and even if he wanted to help, they didn't seem to be able to.</p>
 <p>"What should we do?" Tianhe Renmo put down the beast parchment and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Just then, Yun Yijian walked over. When he saw the beast parchment before Qing Shui and Tianhe Renmo, he said helplessly, "Old Master and the others have been held up by the people from the Phoenix Dance Organization. Within 15 minutes, Che Clan and the Left Custodian will be rushing over. Brother Qing, what should we do?"</p>
 <p>"I thought that Cloud Flutter would be able to stop them," Qing Shui said softly, not looking at Yun Yijian.</p>
 <p>Yun Yijian's face turned flushed red. Previously, he had even said confidently that they guaranteed that they would be able to hold back the Phoenix Dance. He hadn't expected that the Left Custodian had held this matter in such high regard and didn't even mind mobilizing so much manpower to hold back the obstacles in his way.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yun Yijian who appeared a little awkward. He knew that they weren't trying any tricks. This situation was within Qing Shui's expectation. He wasn't a positive person and he would tend to assume the worst possible situation. He hadn't expected that this time around, he was right.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, at the most crucial moment, the Fire Bird went through a tremendous change, becoming a Hell's Phoenix, a powerful False God demonic beast, an Immortal Demon. Moreover, it was a phoenix-type one.</p>
 <p>"Since that's the case, then we'll face them head-on!" Qing Shui looked at Yun Yijian calmly and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, when that time comes, I'll be the first one to attack." Yun Yijian bit his lips and made a huge decision.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, "The Old Master told you to listen to me. You guys can just continue to help to take care of the Imperial Cuisine Hall as well as my wife and the others."</p>
 <p>After sensing the surging emotions in Yun Yijian, Qing Shui no long held anything against him. After all, the Cloud Flutter Organization were a far cry from the Phoenix Dance Organization. If the Phoenix Dance Organization wished to hold back the Cloud Flutter Organization, it would be possible. In the past, the Cloud Flutter Organization had thought that the Left Custodian would be the only one involved. They were still capable of stopping the Left Custodian. However, if more and more people from the Phoenix Dance Organization got involved, it would be beyond them.</p>
 <p>Eventually, it ended up that Cloud Flutter was the one which was held back by the Phoenix Dance and Qing Shui was left to face the Left Custodian and Che Clan...</p>
 <p>There was less than 15 minutes, enough for only one cup of tea. Qing Shui poured himself a cup of tea. The tea was very hot. This temperature wouldn't affect Qing Shui but appreciating tea was good for passing time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held onto his tea cup and look into the distance. They were at the highest story and had a great view. Neither Tianhe Renmo nor Yun Yijian could calm down. They knew well how terrifying Che Clan and the Left Custodian were.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very calm. If Che Clan and the Left Custodian were to come, then there would be no need for them to go back anymore. The people from the Phoenix Dance Organization who had taken part in this matter could forget about getting off either.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, when Qing Shui was halfway through his cup of tea, several tens of black dots had already appeared in the distance. The speed of the black dots was very fast and in the blink of an eye, arrived very close to them. Qing Shui drank up the last sip of his tea.</p>
 <p>Many people from the opposing side saw that Qing Shui was still drinking tea and were all astonished. This kid could really put up a good act, to be acting calm despite being on the verge of death. Did he really think that he was invincible?</p>
 <p>Of course, this was just what many people thought. No one said it out!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held onto the tea cup and assessed the great number opposite which was close to 100 people. Everyone was riding on a huge demonic beast. Although there were many different varieties, everyone had a ride.</p>
 <p>The aura the opponents exuded was very strong, coming from several tens of False God cultivators, especially the several people in the lead. Qing Shui's gaze landed on the old man who was standing in the middle but more toward the left.</p>
 <p>The old man had an upright pose and only appeared to be slightly old. His clothes, with the prints of a green phoenix, made him stand out a lot. The old man appeared very calm and his gaze was very warm, without a hint of gleam in his eyes. However, Qing Shui could immediately tell that he was the Left Custodian.</p>
 <p>It was a strange feeling. He was an existence like the light from fireflies, yet was more brilliant than the sun. His aura was very reserved and standing there, he seemed to have completely merged into the heaven and earth. It made it hard for one to find a flaw to attack him from.</p>
 <p>There were four or five people next to the old man and these people were all more powerful than their beast rides. Although they weren't as powerful as the old man with the phoenix print clothes but they were still terrifying existences. These people were all powerful experts from the Che Clan.</p>
 <p>Many people at the back were all False God cultivators as well, though there were some who weren't. Despite this, they would still be at least at Martial Emperor level. These people were the core pillars of the Che Clan. Without these people, Che Clan would cease to exist.</p>
 <p>"You guys still came." Qing Shui smiled at them and then gradually stepped onto the air, heading up.</p>
 <p>"You're very outstanding but it's a pity that you stand out too much. If you could hold back for 100 years, there wouldn't be anyone in the Dancing Phoenix Continent who would be able to stop you in your path." An old man next to the old man wearing the green phoenix print clothes stepped forward.</p>
 <p>"100 years? That's too long. I cannot wait." Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>"You really surprise me. I don't know how you can remain so calm now. Is it just because you are a Grade Two False God?" The old looked at Qing Shui, feeling very astonished.</p>
 <p>"Being a Grade Two False God, I wiped out the entire Blood River Chariot Formation single-handedly. Don't you think that the Grade Two False God that I am is different from other Grade Two False Gods?" Qing Shui smiled. This old man was muddled.</p>
 <p>"Alright. I'm called Che Chi. At least I'll let you find out whose hands you're dying in."</p>
 <p>"You're scared," Qing Shui looked at this old man who was called Che Chi and said.</p>
 <p>"Scared? What's there for me to be scared of? There's so many of us here. We'll be able to blast you into smithereens." Che Chi sounded a little proud. This proud feeling was an air of superiority coming from a great clan.</p>
 <p>"Why did you bring along so many people? It goes to show that you're afraid. Do you dare you take me on, one-on-one? Do you dare to take this Grade Two False God head-on by yourself?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spoke with a valiant tone, his voice ringing out to the far distance. People within 100 li could all hear what he said. This made Che Chi's countenance change.</p>
 <p>When things goes wrong, there must be something strange. The more fearless Qing Shui appeared to be, the more the other party won't be able to feel at ease. However, after seeing the old man wearing the green phoenix green clothes, he felt at ease.</p>
 <p>"I'll take you on for a round as you wish. I'll let you know what absolute power is." Che Chi took out two huge hammers and walked toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Alright, this is how a man does things. You're much better than Che Qi. Previously, the whole group of them tried to surround and attack me and yet they dare to shamelessly say that this is the tradition of aristocratic clans. You're better than him. If everyone in the Che Clan was like you, then we wouldn't have to face each other like this. They're too arrogant and are just cowardly bastards." Qing Shui commented on Che Chi seriously, while bringing down some other people in the Che Clan.</p>
