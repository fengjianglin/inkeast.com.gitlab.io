 <p><strong>AST 1302 - Qing Shui's Awkward Transmission With the Five Elements Divine Flags (teaser)</strong></p>
 <p>"Oh, I've been to the Southern Viewing Continent before as well. Why did you move over from the Southern Viewing Continent?"</p>
 <p>The old man was the Ling Clan's clan head, Ling Xiao. When Qing Shui heard the old man mention the Southern Viewing Continent, the first thing he thought of was the Tantai Clan. It was because Tantai Xuan also had an inseparable relationship with Qing Shui now. Moreover, he had been the to Tantai Clan before. The Putuo Mountain in the five continents was only a branch of the Western Oxhe Continent's Putuo Mountain. Moreover, Qing Shui had received the Five Elements Divine Flag from the head of the Western Oxhe Continent's Putuo Mountain.</p>
 <p>Additionally, Qing Shui had also thought of Ye Guyan, that proud and lonely woman. He also thought of that young lass. He was the one who had sent her to Ye Guyan personally to let them reunite. He had also helped the Ye Clan resolve their dangerous plight. Even if it was in the past, the Tantai Clan would probably still take care of the Ye Clan, let alone now.</p>
 <p>However, he had no idea if she was doing well now. As he thought of that lady, Qing Shui's memory wasn't very clear, but it wasn't vague either. It only seemed to have been very far away, as if it was something which had happened a long, long time ago. Actually, thinking about it, it was actually already been quite a while.</p>
 <p>"Both the Ling Clan and the Heifeng Clan couldn't stay on the Southern Viewing Continent. They were left with no choice but to move out from there. However, they hadn't expected to encounter a powerful clan like the Qing Clan." Ling Xiao seemed to be a little bitter as he mentioned their problem with survival.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's understanding of the Southern Viewing Continent was only limited to the Southern Sea City. The Southern Sea City was the capital of the Southern Viewing Continent. Basically, all the powerful influences would be gathered there.</p>
 <p>"Old Sir, with the Ling Clan's abilities, there aren't that many people in the five continents who can surpass you. I wonder who is it that was able to force out the Ling Clan. That Heifeng Clan shouldn't be that weak compared to the Ling Clan, right?" Qing Shui felt very curious.</p>
 <p>"The Heifeng Clan is even stronger than the Ling Clan. It's just that even with our two clans combined, we weren't able to fend off the opponents. The other party are barbarians. Our clans were initially based on the Southern Sea Island, but they had taken over. Our clans have lost quite a number of strong fighters and only managed to make our escape." Ling Xiao was very downcasted when he said this.</p>
 <p>"Barbarians?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of the barbarians in the Western Oxhe Continent who were situated close to the Southern Sea. Through the map of the nine continents, he knew that the Southern Sea in the five continents was the same as the one in the Western Oxhe Continent. The Southern Sea was vast, and by right, these barbarians shouldn't be the same ones in the Western Oxhe Continent. Could they be the barbarians from some islands in the Southern Sea?</p>
 <p>There were many islands located in the deeper regions of the Southern Sea, some of which were very big and had a huge population. They were just like a small world themselves.</p>
 <p>The fact that the Ling Clan could escape meant that these barbarians weren't very terrifying. Compared to the Ling Clan and the HeifFeng Clan, they shouldn't be that much more powerful. It might just be that they were greater in numbers.</p>
 <p>"How many people did they have?" Qing Shui suddenly thought of the Tantai Clan and the Ye Clan in the Southern Sea City.</p>
 <p>"There are at least 5,000 of them, and each of them are all very powerful. However, it seems that they don't really dare to get close to the Southern Sea City." Ling Xiao gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>The Southern Sea City's information network should already have informed them of this. Furthermore, the Ling Clan and the Heifeng Clan had already been here for over a year. Moreover, the Southern Sea City would definitely have existences which the barbarians were concerned about. For example, the guardian clans or some clans who were hidden. Although these people wouldn't take action, they had their bottom line. If someone were to surpass their bottom line, they would definitely take action. If the barbarians dared to attack the Southern Sea City, they would definitely step forth.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui didn't plan to head there, and it had already been so long. If anything were to happen, the news would have spread here. The gap between the nine continents was far too great. This made Qing Shui felt that there seemed to be a huge turmoil under the calm appearance.</p>
 <p>The primary reason Qing Shui was here today was to check out how powerful the Ling Clan and the Heifeng Clan were, and also to induce threat. After seeing the Ling Clan's abilities, Qing Shui could now rest at ease. They were a far cry from the current Qing Clan. The Qing Clan could even potentially become the most powerful existence in the surface of the five continents.</p>
 <p>After a chat with the Ling Clan, with the remark of how he hoped that everyone could get along together, Qing Shui bade farewell from the Ling Clan and left with Luan Luan to the Heifeng Clan.</p>
 <p>The Heifeng Clan had heard long ago that Qing Shui visitedthe Ling Clan, and thus they also stood at the door respectfully as they wait for his arrival. Before absolute power, everyone must humble themselves. This was the rule in the martial world, the pride of a cultivator, and the rules of survival.</p>
 <p>The Heifeng Clan was wary of the Qing Clan to begin with because each of those unrivaled beauties in the Qing Clan was all very strong. Moreover, this young man who was coming was an even greater heaven-defying existence. He must have come from the other four continents.</p>
 <p>The people of the Heifeng Clan were a little similar to their surnames and their skin color was darker. This seemed to be due to a bloodline, but it was a pity that it wasn't a Violet Golden Bloodline or Golden Bloodline. It wasn't precious but was still slightly better than an ordinary bloodline. People with this bloodline would have relatively stronger physiques.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that ordinary people would rather prefer to have a normal bloodline than this bloodline. It was because people with such bloodline were too tanned. For men, it wasn't that a big of a deal, but for women, it would be a pity.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't even take half a day to return to the Qing Clan with Luan Luan. Through his spiritual sense, he could tell that there were no experts in the Ling Clan and the Heifeng Clan. He would be assured just by going once. He could also pass some message through the two clans. Moreover, the Buddha Sect and the Demon Sect weren't just watching from the sidelines.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know how the Lion King's Ridge had been. However, Qing Shui didn't find any traces of the Buddha Sect and the Lion King's Ridge in the other four continents. The Buddha Sect wasn't strong enough and the Western Oxhe Continent was far too vast. The Western Oxhe Continent which Qing Shui had been to was just the tip of the iceberg. Although the places he went to were the powerful dynasties, it could be that the Buddha Sect was in a Grade One Dynasty and that the Lion King's Ridge could be in a Grade Two or Three Dynasty. Qing Shui hadn't found anything out. However, they were still a threat and thus, he would have to go and check when he returned.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't plan on heading to the Lion King's Ridge as the news should be able to reach them. Furthermore, news from the other four continents could also reach them. Another thing was that Qing Shui had planned to check out the Formation Immortal Sect when he headed back. Right now, he was capable of doing so.</p>
 <p>After he returned, Qing Shui planned to head to back to the Western Oxhe Continent. He promised them that he would visit them occasionally. Although they couldn't bear to part with him, for him to be able to come back and visit once in awhile had already made them felt satisfied. This was something which they couldn't even dare to dream about in the past. They thought that they wouldn't be able to see him until 10 or 20 years later.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was already afternoon, Qing Shui felt that it was best to return at this timing!</p>
 <p>It was because he needed to use the husband and wife transmission function of the Five Elements Divine Flags. It wouldn't be good if it was too early, and it would be worse if it was too late. Therefore, he chose a time before the sun was going to set to head back.</p>
 <p>After he waved goodbye to the people from the Qing Clan, Qing Shui disappeared.</p>
 <p>When he appeared once again, Qing Shui felt like crying...</p>
 <p>He found himself in water, which meant that that lady was in the water. What kind of water could she be in? He was in a bathtub, it was very large with a diameter of three meters long and there was also a light floral fragrance around him. The blow dealt by these aspects were still considered low. It was because there was a naked demoness right before his eyes.</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui feared the most. He was afraid that she would be sleeping when he transmitted through the places. He was afraid that she could be tending to private affairs. Of course, he was also afraid that she was bathing. He realized that the more fearful he was about something, the greater the likelihood of that something to happen.</p>
 <p>The lady was clearly in a great shock as well. Her long and slender leg kicked out toward Qing Shui, causing a current that was akin to a small dragon to flow toward him. It was a very thin current but had the terrifying intent of a venomous snake.</p>
 <p>The lady quickly saw that it was Qing Shui and recovered her cool. However, she still felt a little complicated. She drew back her attack and then walked over without a care.</p>
 <p>The water in the bathtub was clear and her snow-white figure was one, amongst what Qing Shui had seen before, which could lightt up a fire in a man's heart the most. Her pair of round breasts was well-embodied and exuded a seductive fragrance. Her erect pink-colored peaks were extremely eye-catching.</p>
 <p>She had a flat stomach and the beautiful bosom that was so well-rounded, truly gave one the urge to pounce toward her. However, when Qing Shui saw her private area, he was stunned. It was because it was totally bare, leaving only a pink gap which could cause one's nose to spurt blood.</p>
 <p>"Am I beautiful?" The lady's mature and charming voice rang out as her arms laid on Qing Shui's shoulder.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was as if he was shocked awake. He lifted his head to look at her face which was both mature and graceful, with a little bit of holiness at the same time. There was both awkwardness and a blush on her face. He felt that this lady was very daring and yet very lustful as well.</p>
 <p>"I didn't know that you take a bath at this time." Qing Shui said softly. Since he had already seen her naked, it would feel a little hypocritical to apologize now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had actually been touched in the most important place, both mentally and physically. They should be even now, or rather, he was still on the losing end.</p>
 <p>"Where were you looking at earlier? Was it good to look at?" The lady's expression was calm and doesn’t even show a hint of embarrassment or a tinge of blush.</p>
 <p>"You're a White Tiger [1]!" Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>The lady’s face flushed red and seemed to appear a little bitter as well.</p>
 <p>"That's right, I'm a White Tiger. However, I'm one that is different from others. Don't have any ideas about me, else you'll lose your life." The lady leaped out naked and headed toward inside the room inside where her clothes were..</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still stunned. White Tiger... She should be about the same as Wenren Wu-shuang, and seemed to be someone who would bring bad luck to her husband. It was because if men were to find their way up to their beds, they would die very quickly...</p>
 <p>However, he had the Nine Yang Golden Body which had exceeded the great perfection stage. Therefore, even with Wenren Wu-shuang, he would be able to have sex with her now...</p>
 <p>However, he had a strange relationship with this lady. It was so strange that it made Qing Shui feel as if he was in a dream and everything seemed to be so unnatural.</p>
 <p>He stood up and got out from the bathtub. He channeled his Qi to evaporate the water on his body and very soon after, the lady came out properly dressed. Her plain clothes couldn't hide her well-embodied figure and her face had returned to her composed state. However, there was still a bit of blush on her face which would not be discovered if someone didn’t look carefully.</p>
 <p>"You went back home?" The lady smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>This was the bamboo building the lady had in the Southern Sea. However, Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan weren't around this time.</p>
 <p>"Mhm!" Qing Shui replied.</p>
 <p>He felt very down. To think that the first time he used this to teleport, he had found himself in her bathtub. How could he possibly use this in the future? Although Qing Shui was thick-skinned, she wasn't his woman, and it was still a little abrupt.</p>
 <p>"Is everything at home well?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, everything's fine. In the future, I might return once every month or once every two months..." Qing Shui looked at the lady and said softly.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, that's good too!" The lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"But I'm afraid that something like this will happen again."</p>
 <p>"Do you like to see it?"</p>
 <p>When the lady said this, Qing Shui broke out in perspiration. He touched his forehead as he looked at this seductive lady. She appeared to be a little pure, a little graceful, and the remaining parts were a unique mature disposition. However, right now, her purity and seductiveness and completely merged together.</p>
