 <p><strong>AST 1285 - Divine Beast's Blood Essence, Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm, Dragon Elephant's Power Up</strong></p>
 <p>When Tantai Xuan heard what Yu Ruyan said, she heaved a sigh of relief. She was also very clear that her relationship with Qing Shui had been set into stone, unless she decided not to get married to anyone. If she did decided to get married, she could only do so to Qing Shui. She suddenly thought of her Master. Was her Master's words really spot on? Or was she affected by what her Master had said subconsciously?</p>
 <p>However, these were no longer important. Tantai Xuan looked at the smiling Yu Ruyan who, as usual, didn't seemed to go through any changes with her being in the picture. She had seen too many women like this. There were almost no men who were powerful that only had a single woman, and powerful women wouldn’t be willing to marry an ordinary person. Therefore in the end, even powerful women would have no choice but to share a man with other women.</p>
 <p>Only very, very few powerful men and powerful women would fall in love with each other and would accept only just one partner in their life. However, it was almost impossible to come across a case like this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took Yu Ruyan's hand in one of his, and Tantai Xuan's with another. They then sat down on a long bench in the courtyard. Although the new year was over, the weather was still very cold. The morning sun shone down bright sunlight, making them feel very warm and comfortable.</p>
 <p>The three of them were very quiet and they didn't say anything. Unknowingly, the two ladies each rested their head on Qing Shui’s shoulders. Two faint fragrances came from them and Qing Shui felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction. He would never be able to enjoy such good fortune in his previous life. Even if he could do so with money, it was not worth anything when compared to the linking of the souls like what he experienced now.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, is this place considered one of our homes?" Yu Ruyan lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui as she smiled gently.</p>
 <p>"Of course. In the future, no matter what happens, this will be our home. As long as you wish, we can come here and stay here for a few days. This place has a very great memorability value." Qing Shui said happily.</p>
 <p>When the two ladies heard him saying memorability value, their thoughts strayed off. They quickly realized that it was different from what Qing Shui had meant, but they weren't very sure whether or not he had intended it to be in that way.</p>
 <p>"If Master knows about this, she'll definitely tease me." Tantai Xuan said, a little gloomy.</p>
 <p>"Woman, you're afraid of being teased by your Master just because you've got yourself a man? The two are not the same, right?" Qing Shui looked at Tantai Xuan, dispirited.</p>
 <p>Seeing Qing Shui like this, Tantai Xuan smiled. "You're not my man yet. I might end up divorcing you."</p>
 <p>"Oh, I understand now. You're not happy that I'm not your man. Then let the three of us sleep together tonight." Qing Shui looked at the two ladies and said slowly.</p>
 <p>"Dream on. All men are rascals and their minds were filled with such filthy stuff."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>That night, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal while Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan shared a room. He knew that the two ladies would definitely have a lot to say to each other.</p>
 <p>After he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui started to practice the skills he was already very familiar with. It was almost starting to become a fixed ritual. He took out the bottle that contained the Divine Beast's Blood Essence. Timewise, he should be able to use it now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook the bottle. There was only four drops of the Divine Beast's Blood Essence inside. Through his spiritual sense, he could tell that they contained great power. Additionally, he also sensed a familiar power in it.</p>
 <p>The adolescent Fire Dragon he met in the past and that huge green dragon he saw in his consciousness both had such an aura, but their auras weren't as pure as this one was. After all, this was a blood essence. Another possibility was that the dragons he had encountered previously weren't the most powerful type of dragons.</p>
 <p>Since it was a blood essence of a dragon-type divine beast, then the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant must take one drop.</p>
 <p>Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly thought of this little creature. Should he give one drop to it too? At the thought of this, he felt very excited and he quickly used his intent to call out the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm.</p>
 <p>The small thing now looked very majestic, with two sharp dragon horns and a golden shimmering body. Although its small eyes were only the size of a rice grain, it appeared very intelligent. It rolled happily on Qing Shui's palm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a drop of the Divine Beast's Blood Essence and in that instant he did, a powerful aura spread out. After he sensed this powerful aura, Qing Shui hesitated whether he should let the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm have it. After all, its small body was not as much as bigger than the drop of blood essence.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his thoughts to ask the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm if it would be in danger after it took the blood essence. The reply he got was the small fellow swallowing the one drop of Divine Beast's Blood Essence in a single mouthful. Almost instantaneously, its body exuded a brilliant golden light and it disappeared, directly reappearing in his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool.</p>
 <p>The moment it went into his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool, Qing Shui was stunned. The blood essence in his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool started to seethe. The pool was filled with Qing Shui's blood essence and this seething motion caused all his blood appeared to be boiling and seething.</p>
 <p>The Violet Golden Blood Thread seemed to be getting stronger and thicker now. To Qing Shui's astonishment, his physical strength was gradually increasing.</p>
 <p>What astonished Qing Shui was that his physical strength had increased by 2,000 nimbus. If his overall strength had increased by 2,000 nimbus, it wouldn't be much. But to have his physical strength increased by 2,000 nimbus gave Qing Shui a great surprise. Earlier, he had felt that the blood vessels in his body seemed to have improved qualitatively. This was a result from the increase of the powers in his blood.</p>
 <p>His overall abilities improved a little once again due to the power from his blood. One advantage was that it was easy to absorb and control, just like how a person's physique had gone through an intrinsic improvement, and unknowingly felt the increment in strength.</p>
 <p>The Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm in his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool seemed to have entered into a deep sleep. His entire Central Palace Blood Essence Pool seemed to be in a warm and seething state, as if it was tempering his blood automatically. He could only sense that there were only benefits and no bad effects. When he was about to leave, he saw that there were two Ice Silkworms which were being very active, as if enjoying themselves. They clearly seemed to have grown bigger as well.</p>
 <p>After he ensured that the Ice Silkworms were fine, Qing Shui came out. The Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm seemed to be evolving. He wondered what new changes the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm would go through this time around. It should get a lot more stronger as this little thing had the potential to become Qing Shui's ultimate killing move.</p>
 <p>Having gotten a lot more stronger, Qing Shui felt very satisfied. He called the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant over. This Heaven and Earth Battle Beast's growth still seemed to be a little slow to Qing Shui and he felt that the blood of a divine beast might be able to let it attain a crucial breakthrough.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant let out a low bellow when it sensed the Divine Beast's Blood Essence, like a dragon but yet also like an elephant. Seeing this, Qing Shui no longer had any more hesitation. Right now, he needed to get stronger and also make the abilities of his demonic beasts grow stronger. It might be very soon before the Western Oxhe Continent engage in a battle with the barbarians in the south. It was said that most of those people would be able to drive demonic beasts to fight for them.</p>
 <p>It was because they were close to demonic beasts and were seen as kindred by the demonic beasts. For humans, they were like high-grade demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>After it took the Divine Beast's Blood Essence, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant instantly emitted brilliant golden light. As the Divine Beast's Blood Essence was absorbed directly, the effects were instantaneous. It was just like how it was for the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm which now seemed to also have the dragon bloodline.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant shone in a brilliant, golden light. Its body didn't get any bigger, but the charm it exuded went through a tremendous change and was now more reserved. Compared to before, it now exuded a different aura that was like an ancient ferocious beast that felt a little savageous.</p>
 <p>An aura that was so powerful as if it was going to tear the world apart and bring the skies down was exuded.</p>
 <p>The golden light faded away and Qing Shui looked at the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant in satisfaction. Although the process was very short, the abilities of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was still very impressive.</p>
 <p>His physical strength reached 90,000 nimbus, which was the equivalent to nine sun.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly read on.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Force: Passive battle technique, permanently increases physical strength by 50 times!</p>
 <p>This had increased as well! Qing Shui was very satisfied.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness: Increases random attacks by three times for a maximum of 40 targets.</p>
 <p>The number of targets for the attack had increased by another ten. This was the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's attack for large groups.</p>
 <p>When killing a group of people, this was quite a good battle technique to use.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp: At the great perfection stage. It increases physical attacks to five times as strong, and there was a certain chance for the surrounding targets' limbs to get numb and render them unable to move.</p>
 <p>Its prowess had increased. From the very start, Qing Shui liked the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's Vajra Subdues Demons and the Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp the most. However, at a later time, they became a control-type techniques and were relatively weaker. However, after the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's blood had been awakened, their prowess went through a change once again. In the future, these techniques would shine in the limelight.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion: Instantly leaped across a distance within 3,000 meters!</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi: Instantly spew out Core Qi to attack the opponent and harbors powerful killing prowess. It can decrease the target's speed by 20% for a period of 2 hours.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons: After the technique is performed, multiple targets within a 1,000 meter range would have their strength reduced by 10%. The number of targets cannot exceed 50 and the duration of the effects could last for 2 hours!</p>
 <p>There were no changes to these three battle techniques, but Qing Shui was very satisfied.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack: Launches an attack at one target in an instant. Can raise offensive power by five fold!</p>
 <p>There were no changes to this either, and it made Qing Shui a little dejected.</p>
 <p>Dark Infernal Flames: Dark Infernal Flames under the feet allows the Dragon Elephant’s attack to possess a 20% armor-breaking offensive power. At the same time, it increases the Dragon Elephant’s speed in the sky by two fold.</p>
 <p>Dragon Scale Armor: Allows Dragon Elephant’s defense to double. Having a powerful physical body and attacks were the foundation to the Dragon Elephant's greatest abilities.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the Dragon Scale Armor, he felt like shouting out loud. Right now, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was multiple times stronger than before and was about the same level as the Fire Bird. The Dragon Elephant was an existence which wouldn't lose out even to a dragon.</p>
 <p>When the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant got stronger, Qing Shui could feel that there was something new in his Dantian. It was the reciprocation from the Dragon Elephant. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had a strength increment by four sun in total, and the reciprocation to Qing Shui was 8,000 nimbus. However, it was a pity that he was unable to absorb it immediately. He still needed to continue to temper his body.</p>
 <p>After meeting Tantai Xuan's Master, Qing Shui understood that there would always be someone stronger out there and the path of martial arts was endless. He wanted to continue to work hard and get stronger. After all, he still wanted to head to the other three continents in the future. He need to look for the person his mother had been thinking about, and there was another woman he wanted to look for--Demon Lord Palace's Demon.</p>
 <p>After he tempered his magic treasures once through, Qing Shui was surprised that the Coiled Dragon Statue had gone through an upgrade, doubling the defense of all demonic beasts, including the Fire Bird and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. It was a pity that there were no changes to the Spirit Gathering Lamp and the Heaven Shaking Drum.</p>
 <p>Regardless, there was one which had improved and this was a good start. It meant that the other two would get an upgrade soon. As long as the Spirit Gathering Lamp and the Heaven Shaking Drum were brought up a notch higher, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's and the Fire Bird's attacking prowess would immediately be doubled...</p>
 <p>Right now, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's strongest attack could reach 4,500 sun while the Fire Bird's was 4,000 sun. If the Heaven Shaking Drum and the Spirit Gathering Lamp were to level up, the numbers would be doubled.</p>
