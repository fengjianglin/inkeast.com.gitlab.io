 <p><strong>AST 966 - Apology, Protection for Hai Clan</strong></p>
 <p>It was yet another day of not waking up early, not having morning practice and just enjoying the embrace of a beauty. Such life was like opium for the mind. Many people who could afford to would spend their time indulging in the company of women and even Qing Shui, with his strong determination, could barely keep himself in check.</p>
 <p>Looking at the woman who was hugging him tightly like an octopus, Qing Shui felt very happy. He hadn’t thought that she would be like this as well. When he first met her, he’d never thought that there would be this day.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if he had a Nine Yang Body but he knew that his sexual prowess was very strong. As long as he was awake and he had direct skin contact with a great beauty, that part of his would be upright like a javelin.</p>
 <p>He had not gotten much rest through the night and just did it with her slowly, chatting with her, saying occasionally something shameless, causing her to be extremely embarrassed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui liked to see her beautiful and embarrassed look, do the most embarrassing act with her. It was a visual impact, a deep connection between their souls, especially when it was with such a graceful lady like herself…</p>
 <p>Even if Hai Dongqing was a cultivator, she was still not able to take the drain and midway, they might stop for 15 minutes or so. However, they continued to embrace each other tightly and then continue after a short while…</p>
 <p>It might be because Qing Shui was going to leave soon and knowing that they were going to be apart for a very long while, Hai Dongqing was very proactive. She continued to embrace Qing Shui, asking more and more from him. She wanted him to leave marks from him both on her body and on her soul.</p>
 <p>“It’s morning now. If we don’t get up, someone is probably going to call us for breakfast.” Qing Shui moved a little and said smiling. However, they were still embracing each other tightly.</p>
 <p>“Let me hug you for a little longer. I’m afraid that you’ll be leaving today.” Hai Dongqing snuggled in Qing Shui’s arms.</p>
 <p>"Don't move, if you move, I won't be able to control myself." Qing Shui held her tightly, feeling an evil flame burning in his body.</p>
 <p>"Make love to me one more time! Don't hold back!" Hai Dongqing's voice was very soft.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't contain himself any more. He flipped over to have her leaning down on him, showing her most beautiful face and body before Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing had their breakfast alone, with no one else around to disturb them. They had only sent for food to where Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing were.</p>
 <p>After breakfast, the moment Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing stepped out of the courtyard, they saw a young man from Hai Clan standing there, waiting for them. When he saw them, he immediately came up and said, "Clan head, Mister Qing!"</p>
 <p>"Is anything the matter?" Hai Dongqing said softly.</p>
 <p>"Zheng Clan's clan head is here," The young man said quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui showed no reaction but Hai Dongqing was still a little astonished. To think that he really did come. The fact that someone could wait here calmly with no sound of trouble, it seemed that the situation had not worsened. Could it be that they were really here to offer their apology?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had only asked them to let Zheng Clan's clan head come but didn't say it was for them to apologize. However, his intentions were very clear. Back then, that Elder had also said that they would get their clan's head to come and apologize. No one knew how that Elder had managed to convince the clan's head nor if he was still alive.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui walked up to the front courtyard, he saw a elegant and handsome middle-aged man. However, he didn't look young. He was like Canghai, with a similar dress sense and had caused Qing Shui to fall into a slight daze.</p>
 <p>He had the aura of a leader and also the graceful disposition of an aristocrat. However, all these were shit to Qing Shui. Anyone who was born and brought up in that kind of environment would have the same disposition. Moreover, Qing Shui didn't have any favorable impressions for them. He didn't like these things that people had gotten after they were born. It could cause discomfort and a true gracefulness would only cause others to feel admiration and surprise for it.</p>
 <p>Right now, Hai Dongying was accompanying him. Both parties were smiling, not having daggers against each other. And this time around, there seemed to only have been one person from Zheng Clan who had come.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing appeared, the man sensed it and when he saw the sharp glow and battle will in Qing Shui's eyes, he looked at Qing Shui without trying to hide anything.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui met his gaze, he didn't show any changes to his expression nor did he stop in his tracks. He merely walked over.</p>
 <p>It was true that this guy was more powerful than that Elder and Qing Shui already believed that he was Zheng Clan's clan head. It was because this man who wasn't considered old had a strength of just nice 100 stars.</p>
 <p>Of course, one who could become the clan's head couldn't be an ordinary guy. In Central Continent, there was also differences in the countries' abilities. Some Martial Saint cultivators in certain countries would be able to do as they wish while for others, even those with a strength of 100 stars could lose their lives if they weren't careful.</p>
 <p>"This must be Mister Qing!" The man looked at Qing Shui with a strong battle will but yet still smiled. However, toward Hai Dongqing, he merely threw her a glance and didn't even greet her.</p>
 <p>As the Zheng Clan's clan head, he didn't care for a clan like Hai Clan. If such a thing hadn't happened, they might not even have a chance to have any interactions. But yet, he still had to put down his pride to offer his apology today. Even though he was prepared for it, he still didn't feel good.</p>
 <p>"You're Zheng Clan's clan head?" Qing Shui asked calmly.</p>
 <p>"I'm Zheng Tongxuan, Zheng Clan from Tonghai Country's clan head." The man said seriously.</p>
 <p>"Haha, do you think that your Zheng Clan from Tonghai Country is very powerful?"</p>
 <p>"Do you know what you're here to do today?" Qing Shui looked at Zheng Tongxuan and slowly exerted his spirit energy.</p>
 <p>Zheng Tongxuan only felt a tremendous pressure pushing down on him from the young man. He tried to fight back without any change to his expression but gradually felt that the pressure was getting stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>In this moment, he finally realized that this guy was very powerful and the rumors should be true. After all, they were but rumors; however, given that his young man could suppress him with just his spirit energy alone, it showed that the young man was much much stronger than he was.</p>
 <p>Zheng Tongxuan's body started to tremble slightly and the perspiration on his face was as if he had just washed his face and hadn't dried it. They continued to drip down on the ground.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to look at him, smiling as he increased the impact of his spirit energy at a constant rate. He wanted to crush this guy's sense of superiority and let him understand the reason he was here now.</p>
 <p>Zheng Tongxuan tried his best to hang on, hoping to at least be able to withstand the pressure from Qing Shui's spirit energy. If he couldn't even withstand this, it would be a great humiliation. His battle will from earlier had disappeared and right now, he didn't dare to fight against Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to look at the man and after a short moment, Zheng Tongxuan's eyes flowed as he looked at Qing Shui. There was a bitterness and beseechment in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Now that things had come down to this, Qing Shui would usually give his opponents some leeway. This was also why he didn't use his spirit energy to cripple the man directly. Some people could possibly end up doing crazy things, that was, unless you were to eradicate every single person.</p>
 <p>If he hadn't planned on eradicating right down to the roots, he would try to give some leeway. What he had done was sufficient. Regardless if it was ordinary people or an aristocrat clan, everyone showed admiration for the strong. Qing Shui had demonstrated his horrifying powers and Zheng Clan's clan head had came down himself. This was enough to explain everything. Earlier, he just didn't believe Qing Shui's abilities.</p>
 <p>Right now, Zheng Tongxuan really couldn't take it anymore. He felt helpless and resigned himself to be subjected to humiliation. He was not as strong as Qing Shui and was even the one to provoke him to begin with. However, if he were to be forced to his knees today, it would leave a shadow in his heart in the future, causing him to come to a standstill in the pursuit of martial arts.</p>
 <p>The moment his legs bent, the tremendous pressure disappeared. Zheng Tongxuan abruptly lifted his head and looked at Qing Shui gratefully.</p>
 <p>"I trust that you know what you should do in the future. If anything were to happen to Hai Clan, I'll look for Zheng Clan," Qing Clan smiled and said, releasing a great amount of aura.</p>
 <p>This time around, his aura was not directed at anyone but he had just unleashed all the aura from his body. Zheng Tongxuan almost dropped to the ground and he put his fists together, bowing down to Qing Shui in great fear.</p>
 <p>"I trust that you know what you should do. Qing`er is my wife and Hai Clan is Qing`er's home. Today, I won't keep you here any longer," Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>"Sir, Madam, I'll leave right away. This time around, Zheng Clan is at fault and we thank you for showing us mercy. In the future, if anyone were to do anything to Hai Clan, they'll have to get past our bodies first." With that, he bowed repeatedly before leaving.</p>
 <p>Zheng Tongxuan was extremely clever and thus he wouldn't let go of this great chance to suck up to Qing Shui and to show his loyalty.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing and the others had not regained their senses yet. They had also felt Qing Shui's aura from before and only felt that it was very powerful. However, they had no idea how powerful it was. They only knew that Zheng Tongxuan was very strong and it was said that he had just attained a breakthrough to become an early Martial Emperor. To think that he had been pinned down by Qing Shui's aura earlier.</p>
 <p>"How strong is he actually?" Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui in a daze.</p>
 <p>"Alright, stop looking. Haven't you seen enough yet?" Qing Shui grinned and said to Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>When Hai Dongqing saw Qing Shui's smile, she rolled her eyes and turned away.</p>
 <p>In the late morning, a few beast carriages stopped at Hai Clan's entrance. The people who came in said that they were from Zheng Clan and were here to present gifts as an apology...</p>
 <p>With that, everyone in Cold Ice City knew that Zheng Clan had apologized and the bigger clans even knew that Zheng Clan from Tonghai Country's clan head had gone to Hai Clan personally!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"If you really can't bear to part with me, you can leave with me and let your elder brother take care of Hai Clan." Qing Shui smiled and said to Hai Dongqing who couldn't bear to let him leave.</p>
 <p>"I can't bear to part with you but I can't leave. I might go and look for you in the future." Hai Dongqing said gloomily.</p>
 <p>"Your husband is leaving. Cheer up. I promise that I'll definitely come to visit you." Qing Shui tapped on her straight and upright nose.</p>
 <p>"I'm already very happy. I had thought that you’d never come," Hai Dongqing smiled and said. This time around, her smile was very brilliant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave her a kiss and left. Since he was going to leave, he should be more decisive. He didn't wish to see Hai Dongqing's sad look.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing smiled gracefully, sending Qing Shui off. It was only after she couldn't see Qing Shui anymore that the smile on her face had disappeared.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had left. The reason he had left Zheng Clan alone was so that they could be a shield for Hai Clan. At least for now, this was still necessary for Hai Clan. Therefore, Qing Shui gave them leeway. And with Zheng Clan's clan head expressing his determination, it was all good.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't planning on heading for Di Clan but flew toward where Old Madam Mo was. After so many years had passed, he wanted to see if she was still fine and if she had made any plans. Now, he had gotten stronger, so he wanted to see if there was anything he could help her with.</p>
 <p>His Nine Continent Boots was something which Old Madam Mo had given to him.</p>
 <p>From here to Old Madam Mo's Village of Mo Clan and from there to Di Clan, the journey was not very far. There wouldn't be any detours. Seeing that it was late, Qing Shui decided to just use the Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>After using the leveled up Nine Continents Steps twice, he wasn't that far away. He called out the Fire Bird and it didn't take him long for the familiar mountain peak to come into view.</p>
