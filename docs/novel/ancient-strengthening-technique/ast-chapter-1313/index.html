 <p><strong>AST 1313 - Lady's Seduction, Preparing To Head To the Desolate Mountain Regions </strong></p>
 <p>When he saw that location, Qing Shui went into a daze for a very long time. It was only until he had set the location that he could believe everything was real. Qing Shui looked toward the current Five Elements Divine Flag.</p>
 <p>Five Elements Divine Flags (Husband)!</p>
 <p>Second grade, can be refined with Blood Essence twice a day. For now, two locations can be set up within the map of the Five Elements Divine Flag. The number of locations can increase in accordance with the ascension in grades. The user can shuttle back and forth between the locations. It can be used to travel to each location once every month.</p>
 <p>State: recognized owner!</p>
 <p>It could be used together with the Five Elements Divine Flag (Wife), allowing travel between the two points without any restrictions. The only restriction was that it could be used solely between the two owners of the Five Elements Divine Flag!</p>
 <p>This surprise was too great. The Dancing Phoenix Continent... Qing Shui had thought about it a lot, but had not expected it to be one of the other three continents. He had initially felt that the greatest possibility would be in the five continents, or at worst, in the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood in the space with the Five Elements Divine Flag for very long, feeling so excited that he forgot about the time. After he came out, he had already calmed down. Basically, one problem was resolved.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then used the Five Elements Divine Flag's function, which allowed him to travel between the husband and wife flags.</p>
 <p>He felt very happy, and wanted to share the new grade of the Five Elements Divine Flag with that lady. Therefore, he immediately used the transportation function. This time around, the lady wasn't taking a bath. However, she was on her bed, wearing a set of thin snow-white sleeping gown.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly landed on her bed!</p>
 <p>The lady looked at Qing Shui, as if she wasn't surprised at all. Usually, when the Five Elements Divine Flag was used for transportation, there would be a slight fluctuation one or two breaths of time beforehand. Therefore, she knew that Qing Shui was coming.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled awkwardly.</p>
 <p>The lady patted next to her, "Lay down, let's have a talk for a while."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laid down next to her. This bed was a little big for one person, but a little small for two people. Therefore, when the two of time laid next to each other, it felt a little packed. Their shoulders touched and Qing Shui could smell a faint orchid-like fragrance. Qing Shui subconsciously breathed in, enjoying it.</p>
 <p>The lady was very calm towards Qing Shui's expression and smiled, "Why did you suddenly come back? I know that you're fighting it out with the Great Northern Dynasty."</p>
 <p>"It's already over. You're really well-informed." Qing Shui smiled, not finding it strange that the lady knew about this.</p>
 <p>"For a sect, the most important thing is to have timely information. The Heaven Secrets Academy is the same. You should be the one taking it over." The lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I don't really need it. If I need one, I'll build one by myself. The reason I'm here today is to share a piece of good news with you." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>The lady's body trembled slightly. Even though Qing Shui was next to her, he couldn't tell if she was trembling or if her body had unconsciously moved a little. After so many years, this was the first time she had heard from a man that he wanted to share a piece of good news with her.</p>
 <p>"Oh? What's the good news?" The lady seemed to be very curious as well.</p>
 <p>"The grade of the Five Elements Divine Flag has increased. Guess where I can set the location at now?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Where?" The lady asked curiously.</p>
 <p>"Make a guess!" Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>"The other three continents?" The lady asked, a tad of yearning in her voice.</p>
 <p>"Clever!" Qing Shui was a little speechless, but he didn't find it strange that the lady could guess this. His expression had betrayed him because he was too happy. He already set one of the locations in the five continents, so if it was just somewhere else in the five continents, he wouldn't be so happy. It was unlikely that he would be this happy if the location was in the Western Oxhe Continent either. After all, she was around and he could transmit to where she was without any restrictions. Therefore, there was only one answer left—the other three continents.</p>
 <p>"It's really in the other three continents?" The lady got up abruptly and asked in surprise. When she flipped over, she was leaning against Qing Shui, and her thin sleep gown made Qing Shui's heart beat very quickly.</p>
 <p>"Mmm!" Qing Shui inhaled. He almost reached out his hands to hug her.</p>
 <p>"Which continent?" The lady seemed to have also sensed that her action was ungraceful, but yet thought of something and did not get up. Her well-rounded peaks rested heavily on Qing Shui's chest.</p>
 <p>The lady's figure was very well-embodied. At the very least, her breasts were the biggest Qing Shui had ever seen before. Her rounded snowballs were very heavy, and were unrivaled both in elasticity and beauty. Qing Shui had seen everything that other time.</p>
 <p>"Dancing Phoenix Continent!" Qing Shui gulped.</p>
 <p>Chuckle!</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's gulp and looking at his gaze, she asked seductively, "Do you want to eat...?"</p>
 <p>"Yes..."</p>
 <p>After saying that, Qing Shui seemed to have regained his senses and smiled awkwardly. When he lifted his head, he saw her graceful and pure appearance and her mature charms. It made his heart itch. This was an extremely beautiful elder sister.</p>
 <p>"Erm, I have a weak will. Don't take it seriously." Qing Shui looked at her and smiled awkwardly.</p>
 <p>"Should I let you have a bite?" The lady's arms were pressed down against Qing Shui's and her chest was against his. The soft and tender flesh almost reached Qing Shui's chin. An amazing fragrance went up into his nose.</p>
 <p>"Martial Aunt, I was wrong. I shouldn't have looked at you." Qing Shui felt as if he was half in heaven, half in hell. His upper body felt extremely good, but his lower half felt very uncomfortable...</p>
 <p>"I like to be seen by you. In the future, if you want to look, just look daringly. If it's difficult to see, then you can take off my clothes for me." The lady's mature voice had an unspoken temptation to it.</p>
 <p>Demoness. A demoness who would eat a person whole without even spitting out the bones. Qing Shui didn't believe her words. Until now, this lady still gave him an illusory feeling, as if she wasn't real but was someone who existed only as clouds or fog.</p>
 <p>"What are your plans? Are you going to head to the Dancing Phoenix Continent soon, or will you be heading over at a later time?" The lady no longer teased Qing Shui but rested her forehead against his. When she spoke, her breath entered Qing Shui's mouth and nose. It felt very refreshing. Her teeth were snow-white, having an indescribable demonic charm to them. They were less than an inch away from his face.</p>
 <p>"I don't know yet. We shall see. Maybe I'll head to the Dancing Phoenix Continent to take a look." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said with uncertainty.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, then what are you planning to do in the meantime?"</p>
 <p>"I want to go check out the Beast Blood Tribe. It’s been a while since the Desolate Sect has done anything." Qing Shui had everything planned out. It was impossible for the Desolate Sect to leave things lying. He just didn't know how strong those two geniuses had grown.</p>
 <p>"Mmmm, if you've decided to go to the Dancing Phoenix Continent, remember to pop by before you go. I'd like to go there and have a look too." The lady smiled and said. The tip of her nose had been in contact with Qing Shui's all this time. Sometimes, she would even rub her nose against his. Both of them had arching noses, and their noses would touch each other.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, alright. If you wish to go down, we can go immediately. We can still return immediately if you don't like it there." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>The lady shook her head gently. It seemed as if her eyelashes were going to touch Qing Shui's. Her features looked very mature, but exquisite at the same time. Her snow-white skin was like resin, without a single wrinkle.</p>
 <p>"No need. I'll go when you feel like going. It's not as if I have a strong yearning to go."</p>
 <p>"Martial Aunt, if you don't get up soon, I won't be able to hold it in any further." Qing Shui said. This was pure torture.</p>
 <p>"Haha, I want to see how you won't be able to hold it in." The lady smiled and lifted her head, seeing how Qing Shui's face had turned flushed red.</p>
 <p>"I'm going to take a cold bath!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui licked his lips and then said something which made the lady burst out laughing. Her face, which was so close to hers, was deeply imprinted in his mind. Qing Shui then did something very daring.</p>
 <p>He reached out his head and sucked on the lady's beautiful lips, letting his tongue enter, and gently brushing her beautiful teeth. The lady's body felt a little cold, and so did her mouth. It felt extraordinarily refreshing.</p>
 <p>The lady seemed to have never expected Qing Shui to do something like this. Her eyes narrowed and she once again did something which took Qing Shui by surprise. She neither resisted nor stopped him, but went along with him. However, her actions were so clumsy that Qing Shui once again verified his guess.</p>
 <p>This mature demoness was not only a virgin, but didn’t even know how to kiss, despite acting so daringly and even a little immorally. This stimulated Qing Shui's desire even further. However, he woke up to his senses once again. He hugged the lady, and only let go after kissing her for a very long time.</p>
 <p>The lady appeared very calm and she looked at Qing Shui, licking her lips, "Kissing doesn't feel bad. In the future, if I wish to kiss you, you aren't allowed to reject me."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head. He now knew the lady's situation. She had emotions and desires just like any other person. However, it was a pity that her physique didn't allow her to engage in sex. She could only kiss. However, Qing Shui didn't know why she had kissed him. Seeing how clumsy she was earlier, it should be her first time. This was something which was hard to feign. Moreover, Qing Shui was almost considered to be an expert in this area by now.</p>
 <p>"With Martial Aunt's caliber, you can find yourself all kinds of men. Why did you choose me?" Qing Shui had always wanted to ask this question.</p>
 <p>"I like to eat someone more tender. Kid, are you satisfied with this answer?" The lady's mature and seductive face had a strange charm when paired with her graceful and beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>"This shouldn't be the main reason. Furthermore, it's not like you're that old. You're only 800 years old at most." Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>"You rascal. I'm only a few years older than Ruyan. Alright, your horrible psychological attack to make me confess is effective. Do you really want to know why?" The lady looked at Qing Shui and blinked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded fiercely.</p>
 <p>"Actually, I don't really know why either. It's just a feeling. A lady's intuitive feeling can be very terrifying. Right now, our relationship isn't that clear either. I'm destined to live my life alone. However, if I were to find a soulmate or a friend, it's best to find one who can see me as a woman. However, I won't want to harm the person. I'll treat him like a husband. Would you be able to satisfy this wish of mine?" The lady looked at Qing Shui and smiled. Her smile seemed a little bitter.</p>
 <p>All ordinary people would harbor feelings of love. This was something which was indispensable in one's life. It was even more important than life itself. This lady's physique was even worse than a man's impotence. Impotency could be treated with medicine, but this lady couldn't be touched. If one couldn't bear it, they would have to pay with their life. Who would dare to touch a lady like this?</p>
 <p>"That day when I was having sex with Ruyan, your sudden appearance almost scared the hell out of me." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>The lady thought back to that day and her face flushed red. She said something next to Qing Shui's ears, causing him to almost explode.</p>
 <p>"My physique won't allow me to have sex with you, but I'll definitely use my mouth to try your taste..."</p>
