 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was the only person who was able to understand Canghai Mingyue’s words. He got really fired up just by listening to it. Even the strongest man in the world would want to hear from the person whom he loved most that he was the strongest in the world, especially when it was related to doing that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was just like how a successful man enjoyed sharing with the person they loved the story of their success. If a person was successful but didn’t have someone to share with, they would only get to enjoy half the happiness as someone who has had another person to share with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Canghai Mingyue smiled when she saw Qing Shui in a daze. Sometimes, a few words and expressions from a woman would be able to cause men to be infatuated and fall head over heels in love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few years time was nothing special to ordinary people, but to Qing Shui, it meant a lot. Considering the heaven-defying Violet Jade Immortal Realm he had, he could use the same amount of time to improve albeit the fact that the improvements were small. Right now, his strength has already reached 120 million sun. Naturally, this didn’t include the heavenly talisman, phoenix battle intent, battle god halo, etc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A year to Qing Shui was equivalent to a hundred years for other people. Given the amount of time he has, it’s normal for him to raise this much strength. In fact, he was already considered to be making decent progresses. The majority of Qing Shui’s breakthrough consisted of small breakthroughs followed up with a short span of time to stabilize his power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite having not made any significant breakthrough, these minor and steady breakthroughs were very important. It has helped Qing Shui progress really far from his current state. This could also be considered an unexpected gain. Initially, his plan was only to perfect his foundation even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soaring Dragon Organization already disappeared. As for the three great dynasties, they were gradually growing and have also received quite a lot of resources. The reason why aristocratic clans, sects and dynasties fought against each other was precisely in order to get their hand on precious resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most precious thing across the World of the Nine Continents was its resources, its Heavenly and Earthly Treasure, its herbs and treasures. Some of the places which produced precious and unusual herbs were owned by powerful forces. With enough resources, they would be able to pull away their gap in strength with other people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why large forces with powerful resources were able to develop so quickly. Slowly, they would thoroughly shake themselves away from a lot of the forces for a few hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui has also received quite a few decent stuffs. They mainly centred around medicinal herbs. Furthermore, he found quite a few ingredients for Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and Fortune Golden Pellet. Once he got his hand on the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet, he would definitely experience a significant raise in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why Qing Shui spent a lot of his time on building a good foundation. No, that’s what most of the people around him has been doing as well. As a matter of fact, he has already helped built good foundations for them for more than two times to raise the maximum potential and talents of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If outsiders were to find out that Qing Shui had this kind of strength, they were bound to drop their jaw. Actually, Qing Shui’s ability wasn’t all that unusual. It wasn’t capable of turning an ordinary person into a top-notch genius. The extent to which the person’s would improve had a large part to do with their talent. The more talent a person had, the more they would benefit from it. As for people who came short in talent, it might seem that they benefit greatly from it, in the long-run, the increase in strength they experienced was really insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soaring Dragon Continent seemed to have stabled down from the surface. The three great dynasties became the head of the continent. Certainly, the areas covered by the three great dynasties were also quite limited. After all, the Soaring Dragon Continent was too large. All of these happened at the places within Soaring Dragon Continent nearing Haohan and Dancing Phoenix Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this area was also the place where the most active forces were at. There was also another theory to it. It’s that deep within Soaring Dragon Continent lied a hidden and mysterious being. Legend has it that deep down within Soaring Dragon Continent, both the Haohan Continent and Dancing Phoenix Continent were connected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Zhongyue’s strength was also improving at a really fast pace. Prior to this, he hasn’t really used any of the things which Qing Shui gave him. Throughout these few years, he has already achieved great height in his strength which made him almost as strong as Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he might not be as strong as Old Man Lu, his current strength was already considered to be really terrifying. With him and the old man here, Qing Shui felt really safe. Besides, the strength of each of the members of Qing Clan was also going through tremendous changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, Qing Clan was only a large clan in a village. It could already be considered that they have already achieved an instant success to be able to accomplish so much today. The people from the main branch of Qing Clan was already at least at Martial Saint level. From here onwards, it’s hard for them to further raise their strength. They would need time to slowly accumulate their strength. In fact, it was supposed to be accumulated over time with medicinal pills to begin with. If it wasn’t because of Qing Shui’s formidable medical expertise, they wouldn’t have been able to even absorb it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Yi was under Qing Shui’s care. She managed to break through to Martial Saint Realm just not long ago. Yan Zhongyue has actually played a huge part in it. She even took out some unusual stuff to aid her in breaking through. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to do it so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of both Qing Qing and the Four-eyed Macaque went up by multiple folds. However, Guo Polv was still a lot more powerful than Qing Qing in terms of strength. Qing Shui treated him like a brother of his own. He was his sister’s husband. If he was well, his sister would be happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan looked even younger than before. They have got even healthier mind now than before. The same went for their strength. Now, the strength of all of the people around Qing Shui was experiencing significant boost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was one of the longest times Qing Shui has remained at home since he left Qing Clan. Halfway through, he travelled to Demon Lord Palace quite often. He also visited Western Oxhe Continent and the other five continents only to find no news about Yiye Jiange. Despite all of that, he still insisted to stay there from time to time. He really hoped to relive that familiar moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After such a long time, Qing Shui was very delighted that his Coiled Dragon Stone, Spirit Gathering Lamp and Heaven-shaking Drum had once again gone up by yet another grade. Thus causing the strength of his demonic beasts to be doubled once again. Those were only for its defensive and offensive prowess. As for their speed, not much changes occurred for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, Qing Shui has yet to receive any treasures which boosted his demonic beast’s speed. This has made him really upset. The main feature regarding the Dragon Slaying Beast was its speed. He really hoped that he could find it someday. The strength of the Dragon Slaying Beast wasn’t particularly high, its minimum requirement for the grade of the treasure was unlikely to be that high,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Formation Eye Stone had similarly gone up by one grade, causing the Nine Palace Steps and Laws to experience raise in power as much as three times. Unlike increase in strength, this three times increase wasn’t something which could be estimated with numbers alone, for instance, the gravitation force of Nine Palace Laws has tripled in its base power. Similarly, the speed at which Qing Shui’s energy would be consumed was also tripled. Hence, in a way, this power was still somehow very terrifying, especially when it was used in a battle for endurance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, Qing Shui was happy to find out that there were no clashes between Battle God Halo and his formations. This was an ability Qing Shui just acquired recently after he broke through his Battle God Halo. He used to need to arrange the using order of these techniques just like his formations. But now, this was no longer necessary. It’s just like his normal techniques, he would only need to use it and change its position with his consciousness. Hence, it wouldn’t affect him from setting up his formations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was more normal. If he couldn’t set up formations while using the Battle God Halo, then he could only use it only for himself. After all, in terms of power, the formations outclassed the Battle God Halo by a lot. The only thing was that it consumed a terrifying amount of his energy. Hence, normally, once Qing Shui activated his formations, the only thing left for him to do to make his opponents suffer would be to stack it up with his Nine Palace Laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle God Halo was an inherited mutated battle technique. He was the only person capable of using it. For this kind of thing, one would only be able to acquire it either through inheritance or through their own luck. It wasn’t something which could be simply learnt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also considered a very, very huge improvement. It’s only like this would he be able to unleash Phoenix’s Battle Intent, Battle God Halo, Formations, the Formation Eye Stone and Nine Palace Laws perfectly without any flaws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui has kept a huge amount of things with him and they were really messy altogether. That was when it was from an outsider’s perspective. From Qing Shui’s perspective, there were only a few of them and he could distinguish them clearly. The battle techniques he used to have a long, long time ago had been replaced by him. He also perfected some of the techniques so that he would be able to pass them on to his clan members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t abandon the Blue Lotus Art. He practiced it to its maximum potential after he altered some of the techniques and achieved the 9th Lotus Manifestation Stage with it. However, as he became more and more powerful, he didn’t find it any particularly formidable. Furthermore, it also wasn’t as useful as the Nine Continents Mountain. Hence, Qing Shui would cultivate it from time to time when he was free. But he hardly ever used it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Luo arrived at Qing Village. He didn’t really mention about where he came from, the only thing known was that he came from one of the family branches. But considering that he also hadn’t heard of any existing powerful Qing Clan, Qing Shui decided to not think about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, he still thought that the main branch of Qing Clan would either be an aristocratic clan or the conqueror of the entire continent, but when Qing Shui was standing at the highest point in Greencloud Continent, he still didn’t manage to hear any news about Qing Clan. From there, Qing Shui was already able to tell that he was thinking too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has been so many years, Qing Shui’s, as well as the entire Qing Clan’s strength as a whole has gone through tremendous changes. If there were to be unusual events happening in Qing Clan, Qing Luo was bound to say it. As a matter of fact, he would have said it a long time ago. If he hadn’t mentioned anything until now, it’s surely he has thought too much. It’s not likely for there to be so many contrived incidents across the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving behind some of the necessary things, Qing Shui took a temporary leave ten days after Qing Zun and Qing Yin’s coming of age ceremony. Yan Zhongyue remained in Qing Clan. As for Lu Xin, she left for Great Yan Dynasty along with her other children.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things were slowly progressing more and more smoothly. Seeing that, Qing Shui felt a sense of relief. The problems concerning his parents have been settled. Even though halfway through, Lu Xin appeared as an accident, things were still considered to have been settled nicely. The worry that she has harbored for so many years has finally been solved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than that, it was the problem regarding Yiye Jiange, it, too, has been settled. It’s just that Qing Shui currently didn’t know about her whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The problem concerning Qing Sha has also been settled. Not only so, she has even gotten to find her own blood-related sister. This was a good thing. It could keep her from being too lonely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu, Yu Ruyan, Hai Dongqing, Yun Duan, Mu Qing…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, for now, the current problems at hand could basically be considered to have been solved. The only thing concerning Qing Shui was that he really wanted to settle his problem with Tantai Lingyan, which was definitely not something which could be achieved easily. It has been a really, really long time since she secluded herself. Even Qing Shui himself had no idea whether she had come out of her seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Entering a meditation state wasn’t the only way of seclusion across the World of the Nine Continents. There were some who chose to forcibly seclude themselves. For example, when a person set himself a rule to never come out of his seclusion and interact with anything from the outside world until he reached a particular level of strength. This was to ensure that his mind was always kept at its most calmest state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was unsure on which seclusion Tantai Lingyan went for. He hoped that she could come out of her seclusion by the time he reached Demon Lord Palace. He was also uncertain on whether her seclusion this time would affect their relationship and would feel uneasy everytime he thought about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was already so familiar with the Demon Lord Palace that it was like his own house now. He had his own pavilion here. When he was back there, he greeted the old monster and was surprised to find out that Tantai Lingyan has already come out of her seclusion three days ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

It had been about two years since they last met. She has secluded herself for about two years. Qing Shui couldn’t wait to see her.&nbsp;</span></p>
