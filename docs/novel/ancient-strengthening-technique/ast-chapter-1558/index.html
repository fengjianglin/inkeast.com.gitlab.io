 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><strong>AST 1558 - Kiss</strong></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was wearing a long, snow white skirt. Her flowing, beautiful hair was casually hanging down behind her back. On her beautiful face hung a faint smile. At that time, Qing Shui felt as if the Qin Qing he was once familiar with had come back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was beautiful mainly due to her elegant and unique features. Though unlike Yiye Jiange, who looked very bright and cheerful, she gave people a feeling of inferiority. This was the first time Qing Shui saw her with such a casual outfit. It gave him more of a homely feeling. The aura she emitted had now leaned more towards that of a lovely and devoted woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do I look good?” Though Qin Qing might have noticed that Qing Shui was deadly focused on her, she didn’t feel weird. Without noticing it, she was changing. The state of mind she once had had already been destroyed by Qing Shui, so much so that even her very own nature was beginning to undergo some changes. Without noticing, she was already slowly being influenced by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qin Qing might be the one to ask this question, she didn’t really know what answer she wanted to hear. Or rather, the answer itself wasn’t important, to her, it was more like a way for her to greet Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, it used to be something which had never once crossed her mind. But now, she was able to do it in such a relaxing manner given that she was at the moment in front the very person who made her change.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">。</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter the ending, she was well aware that she was doomed to be somehow entangled with this man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You look really beautiful, beautiful to the point it makes my heart ache.” Qing Shui chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was supposed to have known that nothing good would come out of that filthy mouth. Despite so, she wasn’t angry. On the contrary, she was a bit happy. She wasn’t sure if what she was doing now was considered dating…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely thinking of this word had already caused her to start daydreaming. In the past, she used to think that the term ‘dating’ would never apply to her. Nor it had ever crossed her mind. But now, she didn’t hate it as much as how she used to. As a matter of fact, she began to feel something which she had never felt before. Though she didn’t like it that much, she was a bit excited by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui was able to read her mind, he would have known that she was looking forward to being in love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You little bastard, what are you talking about? You better watch out or I am going to beat you up.” Qin Qing knocked Qing Shui’s head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A vivid fragrant smell entered Qing Shui’s nose. He was already very familiar with it. It was a scent which belonged only to Qin Qing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui exerted all his strength and took a deep breath. The meaning behind his action was clear. He looked very greedy. Seeing this, Qin Qing blushed, “Alright, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and nodded as he walked out the room together with Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere around the banquet this time was considered moderate. Everyone was trying hard to forget about the incident with Qin Ying. They stopped talking about it. If it had been other aristocratic clans, the death of a clan member wouldn’t mean anything to them. No matter whether they were the direct or indirect descendants. So long as they weren’t the disciples who were going to raise their clan in the future, it wouldn’t really mean anything. However, Qin King Manor was not the same as other aristocratic clans. Because they had less people in their clan, they were all closer to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once a person died, they could never be reborn. A life for a life. On the other side, Qin Ying could finally rest in peace now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purpose of the banquet this time was more likely to celebrate Qing Shui’s heroic deed. The things around here could be considered to have been put to an end. In conclusion, Qin King Manor’s reputation has risen significantly like never before. Enemies would have to think twice before doing anything which might upset Qin King Manor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Qing Shui and Qin Qing, their relationship seemed to have gotten back to how it used to be before, yet the people of Qin King Manor didn’t make much comments on this matter. For Qin Qing’s own matter, they would let her decide everything by herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could feel the eyesights of the people from the Qin Clan. They were really warm. A huge part of the reason had to do with Qin Qing. There were still many other factors involved in it which led to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t right to assume that Qin King Manor was behaving like this just because Qing Shui has aided them before. Between two humans, there were bound to be cases in which they would take advantage of each other. In fact, two people who were hardly relevant with each other would never share any in-depth relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one gave aid to a person, the person who received the aid would feel thankful for the other. From there on, they would start getting closer with each other, becoming friends, even as much as becoming life-long buddies. This was really normal. If a person was alone all the time, no matter how strong they could be, they would still feel lonely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, what do you plan to do next?” Old Man Qin asked casually.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were at the point where they were almost done with their meal. Hence, they decided to sit down and have a chit-chat with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am heading off to look for a person. I am yet to have any plans for anything after that.” Qing Shui smiled. At the moment, even he himself was a bit uncertain about plans for the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you need help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have already found evidence for it. There is no need to trouble you guys with it.” Qing Shui smiled and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When are you leaving?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing and Qing Shui were talking to each other after they left the main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tomorrow!” Qing Shui felt a bit reluctant to part with her when he said this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, stay cautious along your journey. I am sure everything will go well for you and you will find the person you are looking for.” Qin Qing smiled and said. She was really calm when she said it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you want to find out who it is?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing shook her head while walking, “If you really wanted to tell me who it was, I wouldn’t have to ask you about it. If you are planning on keeping it to yourself, it would only mean that I am forcing you to do something which you don’t want to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, are you showing me this much empathy?” Qing Shui raised his courage and grabbed her jade-like hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In your dreams, why would I show empathy to someone like you?” Having her hand grabbed by Qing Shui, Qin Qing was a bit upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am going to look for my wife.” Qing Shui tightened his grip when he spoke up to this point. Though it was normal for men to have more than one wife in this world. Women would also wish that they were the only person whom their other half loved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that, Qin Qing’s hand shivered almost instinctively. Though she might look really calm, Qing Shui was able to feel the impact his words had in her heart. Contrary to how she looked from the outside, she wasn’t feeling that calm mentally.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t trying to be a jerk by confessing the fact. His main purpose of doing so was to give her a forewarning about what was about to come. Regardless of whether she knew about it since before or not, he had made it clear himself this time. He wanted to let her be mentally prepared for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why Qing Shui told her was because he didn’t want to give up on her. He was reluctant to let go. He also knew that Qin Qing was upset about it. However, he believed strongly in one quote, “Nothing is difficult to one who sets his mind on it”. Effort would undoubtedly lead to success!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, well then, I wish you all the best in looking for your wife.” Qin Qing smiled and looked at Qing Shui. She was finally calm now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you! Oh yes, about the thing which you mentioned before, when do you plan to marry me?” Qing Shui was holding her hand very tightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing shook her head and looked at Qing Shui, “I have never promised to marry someone as half-hearted as you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haiz, what else can I say other than I’m too outstanding? How much I wish I could have met you way earlier on.” Qing Shui let out a sigh and said in an upset tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing didn’t say anything. She only looked at him and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am really reluctant to part ways with you. Last night, I dreamt of myself marrying you. Why don’t you show me some empathy and marry me? I don’t want to see you simply entrusting yourself to other men.” Qing Shui responded to her with a half true and half false statement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are so greedy. It’s not impossible for me to marry you. As long as you can make me feel like I can’t afford to lose you, I will marry you.” Qin Qing smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui blushed. He started muttering with his mouth like he wanted to say something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there anything which you would like to say?” Qing Shui never expected that there would also be moments when he would feel shy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am scared that you will feel angry. But trust me, I am definitely capable of making you feel like you can’t afford to lose me.” Qing Shui said seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is there that you cannot tell me about? I am listening, just spill the beans. If my heart is truly touched from what you said, I might consider getting married to you.” Qin Qing was smiling as she was saying it. She looked really relaxed. For her to talk about this kind of topic with a man was a feat in itself, which she would never have expected back in the past. Though she might be joking, in the past however, she would hardly ever crack any jokes, not to mention when it was a joke concerning this topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure you want me to say it?” Qing Shui blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was getting more and more puzzled. She then nodded, “Spill the beans!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have got very good skills in bed. Once you feel it, I am sure you will never want to leave me. Oh, you are the one who wanted me to say it……” Qing Shui scratched his head and said in an innocent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You bastard, go to hell!” Prior to this, Qin Qing got tricked by Qing Shui’s look. Now, she was filled with the urge to beat up Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing’s face was very beautiful and tender. For someone her age, she wasn’t the kind of young and inexperienced girl one would expect. At the very least, she would still have a bit of knowledge about the affairs between men and women. It might be that until now, she had yet to find anyone whom she found suitable. This was precisely what’s different about men and women. So long as a beautiful woman appeared in front of them, men would feel a strong urge to approach her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No women wouldn’t yearn for love. It was just that a lot of them would try to pretend that they had managed to repress their emotions. Qin Qing wanted to run away, but her hand was being held tightly by Qing Shui. Before this, she had knocked Qing Shui’s forehead once. And now, the two were facing right by each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart was itching while looking at the side view of that beautiful face. Not only was he thirsting for her, he loved her a lot. The only problem was that he had no idea where all that love came from. This might have a huge part to do with her beauty and the fact that she was one of the women in the Portraits of Beauty. Adding the amount of time he had interacted with her this time, it had greatly affected how he felt towards her. For instance, regardless of how beautiful a woman might be, if she was a vixen and had not even the slightest self-education, or that she didn’t know how to be polite or paid particular attention with her words, people wouldn’t have found her to be charming, so much so that they might even think that she was worse than a pure flower vase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing seemed to have felt something as well and in response to that, she slightly lifted her head up. Just as she did so, Qing Shui’s face was right in front of her. Right at the moment when she was about to avoid him, Qing Shui moved his head forward and stuck his mouth towards her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It felt really soft and tender; Qin Qing’s lips had a sweet scent. As he did so, Qing shui could feel that Qin Qing’s body strongly trembled. But it seemed like she had forgotten struggling to resist him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a person was in shock, the mouth would unconsciously open up. Qin Qing might have been really powerful, but under this kind of circumstances, it no longer had anything to do with strength. After all, Qing Shui wasn’t her enemy. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the chance to be so close to her, so much as hold her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already gotten both of his hands around Qin Qing’s waist. He was greedily sucking on her lips. His kisses weren’t that violent, yet he was able to slowly force her into the kiss in a very clever way. No matter how hard Qin Qing tried to avoid him, she still failed to do so. In fact, at this point, Qin Qing seemed to have even forgotten about what she was supposed to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade-like hands which were initially put in front of Qing Shui’s chest had for some reason, not knowing when, moved up to his neck. While closing his eyes, Qing Shui was surprised to find that Qin Qing seemed to have slowly responded to his kiss. The only problem was that her kissing technique was still very immature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man should find himself lucky if the woman he was kissing had a very immature kissing technique. For now, Qing Shui was feeling a kind of happiness like never before. Without himself noticing, his hands were already slowly crawling their way down towards her round buttocks. Not only were they soft, they were also very bouncy especially the part near the waist; it was so attractive that words couldn’t describe it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing once again trembled. The next thing which Qing Shui felt was a painful sensation on his lips. Suddenly, he tasted something salty. Meanwhile, Qin Qing was already moving her head backwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui lips got bitten by her. Now that there was a small trace of red blood across her lips, her face looked even more alluring. With the additional boost provided by her red cheek as a result of blushing, it gave Qing Shui a strong urge to once again go for her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does it hurt?” Qin Qing extended her hand and wiped off the blood trace on her lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qin Qing, “It hurts, but I am willing to feel the same pain one more time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You bastard!” Qin Qing whose face looked really red pushed Qing Shui away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing`er, my love for you doesn’t just come out of the blue. Though you may look very beautiful, I don’t love you just because of that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was able to feel his words. After all, he was willing to risk his own life to protect her. No matter what, he must have put her at quite an important spot in his heart.</span></p>
