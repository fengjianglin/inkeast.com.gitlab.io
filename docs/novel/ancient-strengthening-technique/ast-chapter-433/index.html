  <p dir="ltr"><strong>433 Canghai Mingyue’s Request, The Success of Godly Force Talisman</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Exiting the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had no idea if the “Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass” would still grow here. He also wondered if he would have the Golden Stone Phoenix Tail Herb in his Realm of Violet Jade Immortal after 100 years by transferring this Stonegold and patch of land in there.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it takes 100 years to mature, then what happens after 1,000 years? Would the medical properties be even more potent? Qing Shui pinned a lot of hope on this “Stonegold”. If he had a continuous supply of Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass and Flower of Life in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, then he would be able to concoct the Great Revitalizing Pellets.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That increase of strength by onefold for an hour was indeed heaven-defying, but with the caveat that it would render the user as weak as an ordinary person for one month. This consequence could be fatal to others, but not to Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This is because he possessed the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and time in the realm made a day outside equivalent to a month inside it. This would allow him to recover in there after using the Great Revitalizing Pellet. By the time he exited the realm, he would be fully recovered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The mere thought of it made Qing Shui all fired up…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After exiting, he discovered the two ladies playing with the “Stonegold Rabbit King” nearby. He had wanted to ask Canghai Mingyue about the strong aspects of the Stonegold Rabbit King, but they strayed off topic every time, and he never received an answer in the end.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sky had already turned dark, but the the moon in the sky was still bright as usual. Reminiscent of silver threads, the moonlight shone down and illuminated the mountain’s summit, shrouding it with a hazy beauty. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beauties under the moonlight appeared even beautiful and fair. The scenery on mountain summit was breathtaking, and the two ladies were like goddesses under the silver light.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The wind was starting to howl. The mountain summit was quite cold at night. At least the three of them were cultivators. Although seeing the dresses of the two ladies fluttering and their tresses flowing in the wind was a beautiful sight, it made Qing Shui feel that they were a little too frail, albeit in a feminine way.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go down. It’s getting cold,” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!” The two ladies nodded their heads!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Stonegold Rabbit King was jumping in front of them, leading the way. He would leap back into Huoyun Liu-Li’s arms from time to time. This made her extremely amused and her distinct laughter could be heard. It was a little melodious and was a type of charm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, I have forgotten to ask you about the abilities of this ‘Stonegold Rabbit King’,” Qing Shui walked up to Canghai Mingyue’s side and asked. Huoyun Liu-Li was one step away in front of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You were in such a hurry just now, and I didn’t even have the time to tell you.” Remembering how Qing Shui was bombarding her with questions just now and didn’t even give her a chance to answer, Canghai Mingyue couldn’t restrain herself from rolling her eyes at Qing Shui. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Right, it’s my fault. Please enlighten me, Lady Mingyue,” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do me a favour and I’ll tell you,” Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui with a smile instead.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was flabbergasted. It was rare for Canghai Mingyue to talk to him this way. For an arrogant gorgeous lady to resort to a method that she wasn’t accustomed to was quite shocking to him. Furthermore, he didn’t have a single clue as to what her request would be.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What is it? I’d even agree if it’s my body you want.” Qing Shui said solemnly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Call me big sister. I have always envied people who have a younger brother. If you can let me be an elder sister for a while today, I will tell you.” Canghai Mingyue didn’t really react to what Qing Shui had said. She had only replied to him gently, with a serene tone in her voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned, and his heart thumped. He then forced a smile and repeated her request. “Be an elder sister just for a while, right?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” Canghai Mingyue confirmed with a smile on her face, but he couldn’t really tell what kind of expression it was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li, who was just beside them, was also smiling at them from the front. She didn’t say anything, but she had an anticipating look on her extremely gentle face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big sister…..”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wait, that doesn’t count. Why did it sound a little awkward? One more time…..” Qing Shui said strenuously with a red face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue watched Qing Shui tenderly and extended her hand to touch his face. Qing Shui felt extremely muddled right now. Canghai Mingyue was a little confused by this situation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could it be that she was feeling insecure?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big sister! You are just as important to me as my real sister!” Qing Shui embraced her gently and spoke to her softly while staring into her beautiful and gentle eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Good!” Canghai Mingyue was still smiling and pinched his cheek!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t say anything else.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This Mountain Leaping Rabbit’s favourite food is actually a type of mountain herb, which explains the reason behind the exceptionally strong medicinal properties in their body. Their blood also contains extremely strong medicinal properties that can cure some leg ailments, activate blood circulation and remove blood stasis. So this Mountain Leaping Rabbit can fetch the price of 5 tales of silver in the city, but they are commonly sold at 10 taels of silver, so they are not something that poor families can afford to eat. After devouring the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass, this “Stonegold Rabbit King” is practically a “Living Medicine”.” Canghai Mingyue explained as she gently pulled away from Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Only this?” Qing Shui was very surprised. He had thought that it would have more value than this…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course not. The Stonegold Rabbit Kings can be battle pets, too. They have strong spirit energy and are highly intellectual, so they are fast learners. On top of that, their speed over a short distance is as fast as lightning, so they can be very dangerous to opponents of the same level of strength. The Stonegold Rabbit King has a lot of room to evolve. &nbsp;Oh right, they have another name, too. Are you interested?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue stopped there and laughed while looking at Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister. Big sister. Dear sister. Sister Yue. Sister Goddess. What’s with you today? &nbsp;Is it that fun to leave someone in suspense…..?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Shush!” Canghai Mingyue blushed at all the random names that Qing Shui came up with for her. She was clearly seen by Qing Shui under the moonlight, and it made his heart itch a little.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Stonegold Rabbit King is also known as the Treasure Seeking Rabbit. It will be able to sense some Gifted Earth Treasures as soon as it evolves into a Stonegold Rabbit King, although this kind of sensory ability only covers one area.” Canghai Mingyue explained while they descended towards the foot of the mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Treasure Seeking Rabbit?” It was out of Qing Shui’s expectation for this dazzling golden rabbit to be a Treasure Seeking Rabbit. Judging from Canghai Mingyue’s serious look on her face just now, it seemed like its treasure-seeking ability was quite impressive. He was actually quite interested in how this rabbit could be a battle pet. In addition, it would imply it could be Huoyun Liu-Li’s assistant.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was extremely happy to have the Stonegold Rabbit King in her arms. She didn’t own any mounts, but this powerful rabbit could be considered as her battle pet now. Owning this Xiantian-graded demonic beast had brought her some sense of security.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they reached the foot of the mountain, Qing Shui bid his farewell to the two ladies and returned to his own tent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cultivate. Qing Shui cultivated one cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique first before he began drawing talismans. He felt that as long as he spent a little more time on this, he would be able to succeed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He still had a lot of “Beast-shaped Beast Skins” and blood of the Darkgold Three-headed Python in surplus from before. So without further ado, Qing Shui started drawing every piece of it carefully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The progress was at 90%!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could easily draw 90% of the entire Godly Force Talisman by now, and he could even feel the subtle movement of spiritual energy emitted by the talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The closer he got to the completion of the talisman drawing, the movement of spiritual energy grew stronger. Qing Shui continued drawing untiringly, the strokes of his brush also turned more vigorous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had used up more than half of the Darkgold Three-headed Python’s skins. Every stroke on the talisman was a drop of Qing Shui’s blood and sweat. Over this period of time, although it didn’t seem long, Qing Shui had been practising diligently for more than half a year in actuality.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could clearly feel that his drawing skill was improving at a speed observable by the naked eye. This made him excited, much like how one could observe their continuous improvements when learning calligraphy or cultivating. It was impossible to unhappy about it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stopped to catch some rest and felt like having some turtle meat. He laid down on the ground and glanced over at the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace sitting not far him. He never had the chance to use it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had been practising the Mighty Elephant Stomp and drawing talismans along with the refining processes lately, so he didn’t manage to do any research, although he had always wanted a Demon Refining Furnace and possessed one now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Demon Refining Furnace was gray in colour, a gray of the purest gray. It wasn’t really spectacular, or maybe it was more accurate to say that it didn’t have any other gorgeous colours on it. But to Qing Shui, it was the most simple and unadorned piece of work he had ever seen. He had not only realised how impressive this kind of silver gray colour could be now but also thought that it looked nice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Never mind, I’ll check out how to use this Demon Refining Furnace next time!” Qing Shui knew that he had the knowledge on Demon Refinery somewhere within his sea of consciousness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Countless of Talisman-shaped Beast Skins were once again scattered and piled up to a thick layer on the ground. Qing Shui was still fully focused on his drawing. The gigantic ape drawing on the Godly Force Talisman was close to completion.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been refining Talisman-shaped Beast Skins in between. He was only left with less than one-fifth of the Darkgold Three-headed Python’s skins by now, but everything was worth it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Talisman drawing was an expensive job. It required the skin and blood of demonic beasts that were at least a Xiantian specimen. One would have difficulty supporting such a great consumption if they were not from a wealthy clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s skills in drawing the Heavenly Talisman could be considered unparalleled. Even so, Qing Shui only cultivated one type of “Godly Force Talisman”, and he had just barely managed to grasp it. A complete drawing required nearly all of the skin on a Darkgold Three-Headed Python that was about a hundred meters long and a few meters thick...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why can’t I get this final stroke right?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had already drawn no less than a hundred talismans for this final stroke. But he always lost the feeling on this final stroke. Or to be exact, that feeling of “flowing water” strength. Qing Shui had been relying on that mysterious natural pushing force to draw talismans. If Lin Zhanhan knew Qing Shui had been using that kind of feeling to draw talisman, he’d definitely be shocked because that was the most difficult to achieve “Divine Talisman Drawing” technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui deliberately refrained from using the Nature Energy or the Diamond Qi in his body when he was drawing the Godly Force Talisman; he had only used the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Failure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Failure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually got used to it, but he had not given up yet. Knowing that he shouldn’t try to run before he could even walk, Qing Shui put down the brush in his hand and went to take a walk in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He went to take a look at the fishes and prawns in the pond.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar was happily chomping on the black fish by the pond. Qing Shui was shocked when he caught a glimpse of its round tummy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He discovered that the Diamond Demonic Boar appeared to have gotten a little larger. Although it was a small gain, it was obvious to his eyes. Rather than fats, it seemed more like its skeletal frame had grown.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Keep growing. It’s my demonic beast anyway. The bigger it grows, the better for me. It’s not a problem of how much it eats.The source of food in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal will never run out.” Qing Shui laughed happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His mood gradually calmed down!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was full of hope about his own future. This was all built on top of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Time was his only issue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again walked towards the forging platform where he drew the talismans. He had always been drawing on the forging platform because it had a smooth and sleek surface and was suited for drawing on it. He was going to draw it half-heartedly this time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was Qing Shui’s habit. He had always used this method to make himself enter a certain state. Much like how he would run in his previous world. He’d slowly run and progressively increase his speed, and then gradually come to a halt. If he abruptly raised his speed to its limits, his heart would not be able to take it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All the thinking he did just now had given him a strong hope towards the future, and he was also confident that he could achieve it. This kind of feeling contained passion and hope, along with a type of confident tranquilness at the same time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of this for the sake of strength, and Qing Shui was certain that it would be in his hands soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With this kind of mood, Qing Shui began to casually draw on the Talisman-shaped Beast Skins. The vigour of his stroke was bold and skillful as usual, along with some spontaneity and calmness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With this wonderful balance of mentality, the talisman succeeded in his hand!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Through thousands of practices, he could finally truly feel the dragons and snakes transmitting through his brush this time. The lively and vigorous flourishes in his calligraphy were like flying dragons and dancing phoenixes. It was as if he was flying and leaping in his heart too.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui lifted his brush, the Godly Force Talisman emitted a flash of brilliant golden light. It wasn’t piercing to the eyes, but it was extremely gentle on the contrary.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s a success?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As if waking up from his deep thoughts, Qing Shui looked at the Godly Force Talisman on the forging platform in amazement. It was exuding a gentle aura, yet giving off a powerful and sturdy impression!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that everything happened too suddenly and was caught off guard. He was actually prepared to painstakingly draw for the whole day or even a few days. He didn’t really expect to succeed on the first attempt, an attempt onto which he hadn’t placed even a modicum of hope.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He looked at the final stroke on the Godly Force Talisman. It was extremely vigorous and was brimming with hope towards the future. Qing Shui thought back on his absentmindedness from earlier. He was filled with hope due to his confidence in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and the Ancient Strengthening Technique, and it was right then that he managed to naturally pull off that final stroke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Talisman drawing emphasized on technique, but even more on verve, because this was the essence of the talisman and its mysterious power!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He shut his eyes and pondered for moment before attempting to draw another one!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Failure!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, a faint smile was hanging on Qing Shui’s face!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He faced about another 10 consecutive failures before he saw that spectacular golden light once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finally grasped the usage of that “Strength of Hope” in the final stroke. This was the true essence of the Godly Force Talisman. He looked at the second successful Godly Force Talisman in his hands and smiled happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt that the talisman he had just learnt to draw seemed to be exuding a stronger wave of spiritual energy than the “Binding Talisman” that Lin Zhanhan drew. He thought that he could give it a try himself too.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui picked up a piece of Godly Force Talisman. He then circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique and slapped it on his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A strong wave of energy immediately poured forth from “Baihui”, shocking Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This talisman that he had just succeeded in drawing should be a Grade 1 Talisman, yet he could feel that his strength was increased by 20%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was an increase of strength to Qing Shui’s physical body. 20% to his physical body’s strength would would be no less than 800,000 jin of tremendous strength. How could Qing Shui not be shocked?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although this kind supplement could increase the physical body’s strength, it would render the additional boosts from other special techniques and cultivation arts ineffective. However, it was perverse enough with just that alone.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui was left wondering if his Godly Force Talisman was of Grade 1 or Grade 2.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>433 Canghai Mingyue’s Request, The Success of Godly Force Talisman</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Exiting the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had no idea if the “Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass” would still grow here. He also wondered if he would have the Golden Stone Phoenix Tail Herb in his Realm of Violet Jade Immortal after 100 years by transferring this Stonegold and patch of land in there.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If it takes 100 years to mature, then what happens after 1,000 years? Would the medical properties be even more potent? Qing Shui pinned a lot of hope on this “Stonegold”. If he had a continuous supply of Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass and Flower of Life in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, then he would be able to concoct the Great Revitalizing Pellets.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That increase of strength by onefold for an hour was indeed heaven-defying, but with the caveat that it would render the user as weak as an ordinary person for one month. This consequence could be fatal to others, but not to Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This is because he possessed the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and time in the realm made a day outside equivalent to a month inside it. This would allow him to recover in there after using the Great Revitalizing Pellet. By the time he exited the realm, he would be fully recovered.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The mere thought of it made Qing Shui all fired up…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After exiting, he discovered the two ladies playing with the “Stonegold Rabbit King” nearby. He had wanted to ask Canghai Mingyue about the strong aspects of the Stonegold Rabbit King, but they strayed off topic every time, and he never received an answer in the end.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sky had already turned dark, but the the moon in the sky was still bright as usual. Reminiscent of silver threads, the moonlight shone down and illuminated the mountain’s summit, shrouding it with a hazy beauty. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beauties under the moonlight appeared even beautiful and fair. The scenery on mountain summit was breathtaking, and the two ladies were like goddesses under the silver light.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The wind was starting to howl. The mountain summit was quite cold at night. At least the three of them were cultivators. Although seeing the dresses of the two ladies fluttering and their tresses flowing in the wind was a beautiful sight, it made Qing Shui feel that they were a little too frail, albeit in a feminine way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go down. It’s getting cold,” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!” The two ladies nodded their heads!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Stonegold Rabbit King was jumping in front of them, leading the way. He would leap back into Huoyun Liu-Li’s arms from time to time. This made her extremely amused and her distinct laughter could be heard. It was a little melodious and was a type of charm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, I have forgotten to ask you about the abilities of this ‘Stonegold Rabbit King’,” Qing Shui walked up to Canghai Mingyue’s side and asked. Huoyun Liu-Li was one step away in front of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You were in such a hurry just now, and I didn’t even have the time to tell you.” Remembering how Qing Shui was bombarding her with questions just now and didn’t even give her a chance to answer, Canghai Mingyue couldn’t restrain herself from rolling her eyes at Qing Shui. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Right, it’s my fault. Please enlighten me, Lady Mingyue,” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do me a favour and I’ll tell you,” Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui with a smile instead.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was flabbergasted. It was rare for Canghai Mingyue to talk to him this way. For an arrogant gorgeous lady to resort to a method that she wasn’t accustomed to was quite shocking to him. Furthermore, he didn’t have a single clue as to what her request would be.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What is it? I’d even agree if it’s my body you want.” Qing Shui said solemnly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Call me big sister. I have always envied people who have a younger brother. If you can let me be an elder sister for a while today, I will tell you.” Canghai Mingyue didn’t really react to what Qing Shui had said. She had only replied to him gently, with a serene tone in her voice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned, and his heart thumped. He then forced a smile and repeated her request. “Be an elder sister just for a while, right?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” Canghai Mingyue confirmed with a smile on her face, but he couldn’t really tell what kind of expression it was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li, who was just beside them, was also smiling at them from the front. She didn’t say anything, but she had an anticipating look on her extremely gentle face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big sister…..”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wait, that doesn’t count. Why did it sound a little awkward? One more time…..” Qing Shui said strenuously with a red face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue watched Qing Shui tenderly and extended her hand to touch his face. Qing Shui felt extremely muddled right now. Canghai Mingyue was a little confused by this situation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Could it be that she was feeling insecure?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big sister! You are just as important to me as my real sister!” Qing Shui embraced her gently and spoke to her softly while staring into her beautiful and gentle eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Good!” Canghai Mingyue was still smiling and pinched his cheek!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This Mountain Leaping Rabbit’s favourite food is actually a type of mountain herb, which explains the reason behind the exceptionally strong medicinal properties in their body. Their blood also contains extremely strong medicinal properties that can cure some leg ailments, activate blood circulation and remove blood stasis. So this Mountain Leaping Rabbit can fetch the price of 5 tales of silver in the city, but they are commonly sold at 10 taels of silver, so they are not something that poor families can afford to eat. After devouring the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass, this “Stonegold Rabbit King” is practically a “Living Medicine”.” Canghai Mingyue explained as she gently pulled away from Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Only this?” Qing Shui was very surprised. He had thought that it would have more value than this…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course not. The Stonegold Rabbit Kings can be battle pets, too. They have strong spirit energy and are highly intellectual, so they are fast learners. On top of that, their speed over a short distance is as fast as lightning, so they can be very dangerous to opponents of the same level of strength. The Stonegold Rabbit King has a lot of room to evolve. &nbsp;Oh right, they have another name, too. Are you interested?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue stopped there and laughed while looking at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister. Big sister. Dear sister. Sister Yue. Sister Goddess. What’s with you today? &nbsp;Is it that fun to leave someone in suspense…..?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Shush!” Canghai Mingyue blushed at all the random names that Qing Shui came up with for her. She was clearly seen by Qing Shui under the moonlight, and it made his heart itch a little.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Stonegold Rabbit King is also known as the Treasure Seeking Rabbit. It will be able to sense some Gifted Earth Treasures as soon as it evolves into a Stonegold Rabbit King, although this kind of sensory ability only covers one area.” Canghai Mingyue explained while they descended towards the foot of the mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Treasure Seeking Rabbit?” It was out of Qing Shui’s expectation for this dazzling golden rabbit to be a Treasure Seeking Rabbit. Judging from Canghai Mingyue’s serious look on her face just now, it seemed like its treasure-seeking ability was quite impressive. He was actually quite interested in how this rabbit could be a battle pet. In addition, it would imply it could be Huoyun Liu-Li’s assistant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was extremely happy to have the Stonegold Rabbit King in her arms. She didn’t own any mounts, but this powerful rabbit could be considered as her battle pet now. Owning this Xiantian-graded demonic beast had brought her some sense of security.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they reached the foot of the mountain, Qing Shui bid his farewell to the two ladies and returned to his own tent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cultivate. Qing Shui cultivated one cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique first before he began drawing talismans. He felt that as long as he spent a little more time on this, he would be able to succeed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He still had a lot of “Beast-shaped Beast Skins” and blood of the Darkgold Three-headed Python in surplus from before. So without further ado, Qing Shui started drawing every piece of it carefully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The progress was at 90%!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could easily draw 90% of the entire Godly Force Talisman by now, and he could even feel the subtle movement of spiritual energy emitted by the talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The closer he got to the completion of the talisman drawing, the movement of spiritual energy grew stronger. Qing Shui continued drawing untiringly, the strokes of his brush also turned more vigorous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had used up more than half of the Darkgold Three-headed Python’s skins. Every stroke on the talisman was a drop of Qing Shui’s blood and sweat. Over this period of time, although it didn’t seem long, Qing Shui had been practising diligently for more than half a year in actuality.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could clearly feel that his drawing skill was improving at a speed observable by the naked eye. This made him excited, much like how one could observe their continuous improvements when learning calligraphy or cultivating. It was impossible to unhappy about it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He stopped to catch some rest and felt like having some turtle meat. He laid down on the ground and glanced over at the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace sitting not far him. He never had the chance to use it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had been practising the Mighty Elephant Stomp and drawing talismans along with the refining processes lately, so he didn’t manage to do any research, although he had always wanted a Demon Refining Furnace and possessed one now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Demon Refining Furnace was gray in colour, a gray of the purest gray. It wasn’t really spectacular, or maybe it was more accurate to say that it didn’t have any other gorgeous colours on it. But to Qing Shui, it was the most simple and unadorned piece of work he had ever seen. He had not only realised how impressive this kind of silver gray colour could be now but also thought that it looked nice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Never mind, I’ll check out how to use this Demon Refining Furnace next time!” Qing Shui knew that he had the knowledge on Demon Refinery somewhere within his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Countless of Talisman-shaped Beast Skins were once again scattered and piled up to a thick layer on the ground. Qing Shui was still fully focused on his drawing. The gigantic ape drawing on the Godly Force Talisman was close to completion.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been refining Talisman-shaped Beast Skins in between. He was only left with less than one-fifth of the Darkgold Three-headed Python’s skins by now, but everything was worth it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Talisman drawing was an expensive job. It required the skin and blood of demonic beasts that were at least a Xiantian specimen. One would have difficulty supporting such a great consumption if they were not from a wealthy clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s skills in drawing the Heavenly Talisman could be considered unparalleled. Even so, Qing Shui only cultivated one type of “Godly Force Talisman”, and he had just barely managed to grasp it. A complete drawing required nearly all of the skin on a Darkgold Three-Headed Python that was about a hundred meters long and a few meters thick...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why can’t I get this final stroke right?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had already drawn no less than a hundred talismans for this final stroke. But he always lost the feeling on this final stroke. Or to be exact, that feeling of “flowing water” strength. Qing Shui had been relying on that mysterious natural pushing force to draw talismans. If Lin Zhanhan knew Qing Shui had been using that kind of feeling to draw talisman, he’d definitely be shocked because that was the most difficult to achieve “Divine Talisman Drawing” technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui deliberately refrained from using the Nature Energy or the Diamond Qi in his body when he was drawing the Godly Force Talisman; he had only used the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Failure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Failure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually got used to it, but he had not given up yet. Knowing that he shouldn’t try to run before he could even walk, Qing Shui put down the brush in his hand and went to take a walk in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He went to take a look at the fishes and prawns in the pond.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar was happily chomping on the black fish by the pond. Qing Shui was shocked when he caught a glimpse of its round tummy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He discovered that the Diamond Demonic Boar appeared to have gotten a little larger. Although it was a small gain, it was obvious to his eyes. Rather than fats, it seemed more like its skeletal frame had grown.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Keep growing. It’s my demonic beast anyway. The bigger it grows, the better for me. It’s not a problem of how much it eats.The source of food in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal will never run out.” Qing Shui laughed happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His mood gradually calmed down!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was full of hope about his own future. This was all built on top of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Time was his only issue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again walked towards the forging platform where he drew the talismans. He had always been drawing on the forging platform because it had a smooth and sleek surface and was suited for drawing on it. He was going to draw it half-heartedly this time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was Qing Shui’s habit. He had always used this method to make himself enter a certain state. Much like how he would run in his previous world. He’d slowly run and progressively increase his speed, and then gradually come to a halt. If he abruptly raised his speed to its limits, his heart would not be able to take it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All the thinking he did just now had given him a strong hope towards the future, and he was also confident that he could achieve it. This kind of feeling contained passion and hope, along with a type of confident tranquilness at the same time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of this for the sake of strength, and Qing Shui was certain that it would be in his hands soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With this kind of mood, Qing Shui began to casually draw on the Talisman-shaped Beast Skins. The vigour of his stroke was bold and skillful as usual, along with some spontaneity and calmness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With this wonderful balance of mentality, the talisman succeeded in his hand!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Through thousands of practices, he could finally truly feel the dragons and snakes transmitting through his brush this time. The lively and vigorous flourishes in his calligraphy were like flying dragons and dancing phoenixes. It was as if he was flying and leaping in his heart too.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui lifted his brush, the Godly Force Talisman emitted a flash of brilliant golden light. It wasn’t piercing to the eyes, but it was extremely gentle on the contrary.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s a success?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As if waking up from his deep thoughts, Qing Shui looked at the Godly Force Talisman on the forging platform in amazement. It was exuding a gentle aura, yet giving off a powerful and sturdy impression!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that everything happened too suddenly and was caught off guard. He was actually prepared to painstakingly draw for the whole day or even a few days. He didn’t really expect to succeed on the first attempt, an attempt onto which he hadn’t placed even a modicum of hope.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He looked at the final stroke on the Godly Force Talisman. It was extremely vigorous and was brimming with hope towards the future. Qing Shui thought back on his absentmindedness from earlier. He was filled with hope due to his confidence in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and the Ancient Strengthening Technique, and it was right then that he managed to naturally pull off that final stroke.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Talisman drawing emphasized on technique, but even more on verve, because this was the essence of the talisman and its mysterious power!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He shut his eyes and pondered for moment before attempting to draw another one!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Failure!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, a faint smile was hanging on Qing Shui’s face!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He faced about another 10 consecutive failures before he saw that spectacular golden light once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finally grasped the usage of that “Strength of Hope” in the final stroke. This was the true essence of the Godly Force Talisman. He looked at the second successful Godly Force Talisman in his hands and smiled happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt that the talisman he had just learnt to draw seemed to be exuding a stronger wave of spiritual energy than the “Binding Talisman” that Lin Zhanhan drew. He thought that he could give it a try himself too.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui picked up a piece of Godly Force Talisman. He then circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique and slapped it on his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A strong wave of energy immediately poured forth from “Baihui”, shocking Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This talisman that he had just succeeded in drawing should be a Grade 1 Talisman, yet he could feel that his strength was increased by 20%.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was an increase of strength to Qing Shui’s physical body. 20% to his physical body’s strength would would be no less than 800,000 jin of tremendous strength. How could Qing Shui not be shocked?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although this kind supplement could increase the physical body’s strength, it would render the additional boosts from other special techniques and cultivation arts ineffective. However, it was perverse enough with just that alone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui was left wondering if his Godly Force Talisman was of Grade 1 or Grade 2.</p>
