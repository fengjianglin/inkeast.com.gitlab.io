 <p><strong>AST 1237 - Women are the root of all troubles; confused. Hugging the Eldest Princess</strong></p>
 <p>It shouldn’t be a problem for him to protect himself. He felt that he was capable of managing at least that. From his perspective, the strength of the Saint Child was worth most likely around fifteen million nimbus. Against this kind of strength, Qing Shui should be able to fight it to a draw. He had a few battle techniques which he could coordinate with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Fifteen million nimbus worth of strength... once it got weakened by both Qing Shui and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, it would worth less than 1.1 million nimbus. Under the condition when the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was at its peak, it could be weakened up to nearly ten million nimbus and a bit more. Basically, once it coordinated with himself, he would be able to fight against someone with an initial strength of 15 million who was weakened to a draw.</p>
 <p>This was just speaking in general, however, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast, Qing Shui felt that if it was merely 15 million nimbus of strength, the Dragon Elephant should be able to defeat the opponent once the opponent was weakened. It wasn’t called the Heaven and Earth Battle Beast for nothing.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of this that Qing Shui decided to send out the challenge letter. He felt that if the Dragon Elephant coordinated with himself, he could at least secure a position for himself where he wouldn’t be defeated. As long as he was able to hinder his opponent, he should be able to defeat his opponent along with his demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>“You finally came back to your senses. What were you thinking? You can still get distracted at a time like this,” said the Eldest Princess in an unsatisfied tone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui came back to his senses and looked at the Eldest Princess embarrassingly. She had her brows slightly knitted. Obviously, she must be worried about this matter. He opened his mouth and smiled, “What’s wrong? Are you worried about me?”</p>
 <p>He was also only saying it playfully. This was all to make the tense atmosphere more relaxed. It’s just that at the time when he finished saying it, he felt a bit weird. Even though the two were considered to be really great friends at the moment, he still found it a bit inappropriate to say this.</p>
 <p>“Who is worried about you? You are not even concerned of your own well being, is there a point of people being worried about you?” The Eldest Princess was mad at the fact that Qing Shui wrote the challenge letter.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about it. Sister Su, you have to cheer for me and not that so-called Saint Child. Even if he wants to woo you, you can’t do that.” Qing Shui smiled while looking at the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>“You are never serious. What kind of situation are you in now? And yet you still have the mood to joke around. I forbid you from sending out this challenge letter.” The Eldest Princess replied after thinking for quite a while.</p>
 <p>Deep down, Qing Shui felt really touched. Suddenly, he had a feeling that he was really close to this woman. The concerns humans had for each other might be shown unintentionally through certain matters. The problem itself might not be huge, it might just be a small incident, but this wasn’t important, what was important was the interaction between two hearts which was felt all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, I know you’re worried about me. Things will be fine. I don’t want to die yet. I still have my family, my wife's and my children. You don’t have to be worried about me, I have a very persistent life, normal people wouldn’t be able to take it away so easily.” Qing Shui said with a smile. He might have sounded really relaxed, but at the same time, he was able to let people know that he was really serious.</p>
 <p>“Listen to me. Currently you aren't suited to battle against him.” The Eldest Princess said seriously while looking at QIng Shui.</p>
 <p>“Sunu, don’t worry, I won’t take his life.” At this moment, a gentle-sounding voice drifted over.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and the Eldest Princess froze in shock. Qing Shui abruptly turned around only to see a man standing high up in the air far in the distance. At this moment, he was staring right at them with a smile. While standing in mid-air, he was emitting an unusually harmonious vibe.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui squinted his eyes as he looked at the man far away. He was unable to tell the age of the man based on his look. He looked as graceful as an immortal. His eyes might look warm, but it was a kind of warmth which no one would dare to look down upon. At this moment, he formed a very distinct contrast with Qing Shui. In between Qing Shui’s brows, there was a purple colored mark. His gentle and reserved nature contained a kind of manliness within it. It’s just that when compared to the man in front, Qing Shui’s gentleness was shown to be more bewitching. Despite so, it wouldn’t make people felt that he was a sissy. On the contrary, people would feel that he had a kind of unusual charm with him.</p>
 <p>This man looked very handsome. But what was more outstanding was his temperament. Anyone who saw him would feel that he was a righteous man, a man who was able to leave good impressions on people of all ages.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t sheer luck that he was able to be the leader of Saint Child Band. He had the imposing attitude for it. Qing Shui could already tell that this person was the Saint Child by merely looking at him. There was also a faintly discernable aura emitted from his body.</p>
 <p>“Take away my life? Are you strong enough to take it away? Take this!” Qing Shui randomly swung his hand and immediately tossed out a challenge letter towards Saint Child.</p>
 <p>The thin beast parchment flew towards the man like a sharp sword. Qing Shui purposely used the Hidden Weapon technique to throw it.</p>
 <p>The man smiled. He extended his hand and effortlessly took over the challenge letter which Qing Shui threw.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t like his arrogant attitude. It might not have necessarily been counted as being arrogant. From Qing Shui’s perspective, this was the kind of impression this man gave people - an arrogant bully. Actually, this was an aura which people usually developed a habit for once they stayed in a high and lofty position for too long.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!” The Eldest Princess pulled Qing Shui’s sleeves. She was worried that Qing Shui would charge in recklessly.</p>
 <p>As the Saint Child saw the Eldest Princess so close to another man, even if it was just pulling his sleeves, his expressions instantly changed.</p>
 <p>“Sunu, stop pulling him. I still mean what I said. Besides, the challenge letter is here already.” The man said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui chuckled and immediately went on to hold the eldest princess’ hand. Previously, he already noticed the unhappy look across the man’s eyes. It’s just that the man managed to hide it really well. Nevertheless, he still managed to see through it. This was because he had heard that this man liked the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess also never expected for Qing Shui to be this daring. She glared at Qing Shui. Despite so, she didn’t try to pull back her hand. Even she herself didn’t really know how she was feeling. She knew that this might be a bad thing, but other than this, there was no other way to make this man give up on her.</p>
 <p>Since her hand has already been held by this very young man here. That man definitely would not stop interfering with her unless Qing Shui died. He was a man of perfection. He wouldn’t allow even the slightest bit of a blemish to appear on whatever he pursued.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess felt that it was way too tiring to live with this kind of person. No one would be willing to be his woman. The reason being that, that was a kind of burden, not happiness. This was also why the Saint Child was single till now.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess was even capable of making him fall in love with her. From here, it could be seen just how outstanding a person the Eldest Princess was.</p>
 <p>“I take back the promise which I made about not killing you. If you break that arm of yours now, I can still consider letting you live.” The man looked really calm. But in actuality, he was more furious than anyone present.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, even though he is a powerful man, he isn’t suited to be a husband. Will it be alright if you leave your marriage to me?” Qing Shui said with a smile. He was not in the least concerned about that man.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui felt that a man who was able to do things up to this extent should be a very outstanding man. But never would he have thought that it would turn out to be such an emphatic man. Even though the Saint Child was really powerful, Qing Shui already had not even the slightest good feelings towards him.</p>
 <p>It’s just that Qing Shui didn’t know that in actuality, the Eldest Princess had long since been considered as Saint Child’s reverse scale even though he hadn’t managed to obtain her. The reason why he lost his self-control was because Qing Shui has been too close to the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>It’s not that he wasn’t generous enough. It’s because he knew that the Eldest Princess wasn’t that close to that man. It’s always been said that if it was a matter which showed no concern to oneself, getting involved in it would only make matters worse. A lifetime of cleverness can be interrupted by moments of stupidity. It had never once crossed his mind that that the Eldest Princess was not someone who could be gone after so easily.</p>
 <p>“There is still one more reason why I came looking for you today. On what condition will you help my little brother remove the poison from his body?" This was the main reason why the Saint Child came.</p>
 <p>“I have said it before. If you want to live, break off both of your arms. If you insist on wanting your arms, you will lose your life. If a warrior is unable to keep even a promise, he wouldn’t be suited to live in this world. Could it be that you really think that you can cover the sky by yourself?” Qing Shui said in neither an obsequious nor supercilious tone. He wasn’t trying to promote anything through his words, he just wasn’t used to seeing this kind of bullying, nasty attitude of Fu Yanting. Let alone, those kinds of people should get the punishments which they deserved.</p>
 <p>“Great, then let's meet each other at the Arena of Life and Death. I’ll let you live for two more days.” The man disappeared after he finished speaking.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “Femme Fatale”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” The Eldest Princess asked angrily.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I only said that eldest princess, you’re a beauty who could topple over cities.” Qing Shui said hurriedly.</p>
 <p>“En, let go of me. You have already made him angry to the point that he left. You certainly have some skills. Only very few people are able to actually anger him to this extent.” The Eldest Princess lifted Qing Shui’s hand speechless. She knew that the person left because of herself. But Qing Shui on the other hand, he has now been put in a very dangerous situation.</p>
 <p>She never once thought that her hand would be held by a man. Furthermore, she also never expected a man to be this daring. Now, she was feeling really complicated, the reason being that she wasn’t actually that angry. She was only treating him as her brother, this was only considered as giving him some small advantages.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly let go of her hand and smiled, “Sister Su wasn’t the one at fault here, I was the one being rude here. I didn’t harbor any dirty intentions towards you. You are like a god in my heart. You’re someone who I could never blaspheme.”</p>
 <p>“Alright stop it.” The Eldest Princess said angrily. She conveniently let out her hand and knocked Qing Shui’s forehead. She felt really relaxed and comfortable while talking to him. In contrast to that, she would sound really lifeless talking to other men. When in front of her, they would either be fake or pretend to be someone else. They were never able to leave even a single deep impression on her.</p>
 <p>“Well, great, he will definitely not let you go now. Why are you always trying to push yourself to the point of no return?” The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui confused.</p>
 <p>“That’s because only at the point of no return will I be able to force out my largest potential. Sister Su, would you like to give me some motivation? For all you know, I might be able to emerge victorious because of it.” Qing Shui said gently.</p>
 <p>“Haih, what kind of motivation? I will give you whatever that’s within my power.” The Eldest Princess said while letting out a sigh.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at both of her eyes. Those pupils of hers looked clear like immortals. He smiled, “It has been a long time since I hugged a person. I feel a sudden urge to hug someone.”</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess stunned. She looked up at Qing Shui, looked at his tranquil and pure eyes which didn’t contain any wicked intentions. There was a kind of undescribable exhausted look within that eyes of his. For a moment, her heart got soft, “I am your sister. There is no next time.”</p>
 <p>At the moment when the Eldest Princess finished speaking, she opened up both her arms and embraced it around Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui regretted a little saying it. He didn’t actually mean to take advantage of her. Everyone would feel tired at some point, and when that happened, they would try to seek support. No matter how tough a person had been, for example, when they got home, no matter how significant a character he was, at the time when he saw both his parents, he would still feel like depending on them. This was because they were forever their children. Even without parents, they would still have a family, a wife, and children of their own.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess found the expression Qing Shui made from before really familiar. She was able to understand how he felt, the reason being that she has been in similar situations countless times prior to this. She wasn’t feeling sympathetic for him... It wasn’t any other kinds of feelings either. Even she herself was unable to understand what she was thinking at this moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged her. He was hugging her very tightly. His entire face was buried in her soft neck. At this moment, he had not even the slightest crooked thought. It was just a simple hug, yet there was an indescribable kind of peacefulness in it.</p>
 <p>Despite having a pair of soft arms embracing him, he was still able to keep his mind clean…… Not everyone could maintain this kind of feeling. It would be hard for it to happen even once throughout one’s life.</p>
 <p>It seemed like the Eldest Princess also shared the same feeling. This was that rare opportunity. The two quietly hugged each other as if they had even forgotten about time itself. Not knowing how long it has been, the Eldest Princess slightly opened up both of her eyes only to be awestruck. She saw both Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess looking back at both of them blankly from far away.</p>
 <p>What’s wrong? People have already managed to get so near and yet they were unable to notice it...</p>
