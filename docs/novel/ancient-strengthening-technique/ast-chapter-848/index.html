 <p><strong>AST 848 - The Person Who Humiliates, Often Receives Humiliation (teaser)</strong></p>
 <p>After sensing that there were a few flying beasts tailing behind him, Qing Shui had wanted to throw them off his track with a Nine Continents Steps. However, thinking of how he had not offended anyone in Central Continent, with the exception of causing that one person to have lost his pride earlier at the Emperor City Auction Hall. Or rather, he had borrowed Tang Wude's status to cause the other party to lose his pride.</p>
 <p>Since the other party was afraid of Tang Manor, it meant that they were not as powerful as Tang Manor. However, they still dared to follow him. They must have investigated his identity and they must also be considered quite a strong clan in the area.</p>
 <p>He gradually flew out of the Central Continent City, where there was a spacious wilderness. This was how the terrain in the world of the nine continents was like. There would basically be a piece of wilderness between any two cities, even if it was near a Continent's Capital.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowed down upon reaching this wilderness. He knew that the people behind him would catch up very quickly. Qing Shui shook his head. There was no fairness in this world, not even in bidding for an auctioned item.</p>
 <p>The prerequisite to having fairness was that both parties must be standing at the same level. If they were not on ground of the same height, there would be no such thing as fairness. It was like now, the person who was following them had pressured the people on the first level of the auction hall and how Tang Wude had pressured him. And now, they were now coming to deal with this outsider.</p>
 <p>"Since you guys are here, just come out!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui came to a stop and said softly. Although his voice was not loud, it could be heard several thousand meters away. Moreover, he had already sensed that those people had followed him here. The only thing was that they were not that strong.</p>
 <p>The sound of a flying beast's flapping wings rang out and three Black Feather Cranes appeared around Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>There were a total of five people on the three Black Feather Cranes, four of which were old men, while the last one seemed to be a young man who should be slightly older than Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Your spiritual sense is not bad. To think that you can discover us from such a distance away," One of the old man who was wearing clothes made of sackcloth said slowly.</p>
 <p>The old man was of a mediocre figure but his face was horrendous. There was almost no gap between his two brows, making them appear like a thick black worm. His eyes were small like the size of beans, flashing hints of cold light. His nose, which was considerably large, took up a huge part of his face. It was hard to forget such a person even after just a single glance.</p>
 <p>The other three old men could be considered normal but these people had a hint of viciousness exuding from them. Qing Shui's spiritual sense was much more powerful now and thus he was positive that the aura they were exuding was related to the martial techniques they cultivated.</p>
 <p>"Why are you following me?" Although Qing Shui guessed that the reason was because of what happened at the auction hall, he was not sure and thus decided to ask.</p>
 <p>"Why did we follow you? We'll tell you when you've died. You're just an outsider but yet you don't know how to keep a low profile. You think that you're a member of Tang Manor?" That young man looked at Qing Shui furiously and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. They were really the other party from the auction hall. Putting aside that they had already suggested it through their words, there was one more thing which made him sure. It was the other party's voice. This voice was from the person who was competing with him at the auction hall.</p>
 <p>"Aren't you guys afraid that Tang Manor will deal with you? I'm a friend of Tang Manor," Qing Shui smiled and said to the young man.</p>
 <p>"Friend? Haha, stop blowing your own trumpet. I have no idea what means you used to save Tang Manor's Tang Chong but you're just a travelling physician. Earlier, at the Emperor City Auction Hall, Tang Manor was the one who paid, right? To think that a poor bloke like you would dare to think of being friends with Tang Manor," The young man laughed. Even when he laughed, he was still exuding a hint of coldness.</p>
 <p>"That's right. What's wrong with that? I'm friends with Tang Manor! Friendship is not measured by wealth." Qing Shui deliberately made it sound as if he was puzzled.</p>
 <p>"Don't you understand that their action just meant that all the debts between you and Tang Manor have been cleared? Friends? You think Tang Manor's friends are so cheap?" The young man said with disdain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it and could not help but agree. If it was not because of his potential it would really be hard for him to become friends with Tang Manor. It was the same in every society. If you don't have the ability, why would people want to become friends with you?</p>
 <p>"You're killing me just because of this?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at the young man, asking.</p>
 <p>"Handover that antique, kneel down before me and I will forget about everything," the young man looked at Qing Shui and said with a domineering tone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the young man and shook his head, "Why are there so many idiots in this world?"</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui's words ended, the young man who was standing on the back of one of the Black Feather Crane dropped to his knees in Qing Shui's direction. Before Qing Shui had spoken, he had sent two silver needles flying, hitting the young man in his knees.</p>
 <p>Do unto people what people do unto you. There was no need to be courteous toward people like this. They needed to be stomped down to their deaths.</p>
 <p>Initially, the silver needles had not fully pierced into his knees but he already felt tremendous pain and could not help but let out a painful cry. However, when he dropped to his knees, his kneecaps came into contact with the Black Feather Crane's hardy back and they dug deeper into his knees, causing him to cry out in agony once again.</p>
 <p>The kneecap is one of a person's most fragile and sensitive spots and there were many acupuncture points there. Now that his kneecaps were pierced by needles and especially when it was done by Qing Shui intentionally, the pain was simply unbearable. Moreover, after he had knelt down, they stabbed into his bones and bent inside his body, causing the pain to reach all the way to his marrow.</p>
 <p>"Kill him! Kill him!"</p>
 <p>The young man rolled on the Black Feather Crane's crying out in agony.</p>
 <p>Three of the old men dashed out toward Qing Shui on the Black Feather Cranes. They were not weak but they were far from a match for the current Qing Shui. Qing Shui calmly took out the Soulshake Bell.</p>
 <p>Ring……</p>
 <p>That piercing sound rang out, causing one to feel as if it could penetrate through the roots of one's teeth as well as one's eardrums. Two of the three Peak Martial King Black Feather Cranes died immediately. The last remaining one went crazy. It was the one the young man was riding on.</p>
 <p>Caught off guard, the one of the young man's leg was bitten off by the Black Feather Crane. The remaining old man, who had stayed behind, quickly saved the young man from the crane's mouth, killing it in fury.</p>
 <p>The old man who was an elementary Martial Saint was able to easily deal with a Peak Martial King demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Ball!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to try the prowess of his Primordial Flame Ball. Although the people before him were a bit weak, he could still give it a try. The Primordial Flame Ball quickly formed in his hands. Sensing the terrifying prowess of the Primordial Flame Ball, the few old men were stunned.</p>
 <p>With this pause, they ended up being devoured by Qing Shui's Primordial Flame Ball.</p>
 <p>This caused the two remaining old man and the young man who had lost one of his legs to panic. Their faces turned pale. This was too scary. The flame ball in Qing Shui's hand had burned two elementary Martial Saints, leaving not even ashes.</p>
 <p>"Which clan are you guys from?" Qing Shui smiled, stepping into the air as he walked over.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had not thought of challenging the backing these people had for now, it would be good for him to know in case they came into contact in the future. He might be able to avoid some trouble.</p>
 <p>The other party did not say a word, nor did they try to fight back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again garnered up a Primordial Flame Ball. Qing Shui was very satisfied with the prowess of this flame ball. It could even instantly kill people who were of the same level as him. Moreover, he also had the Twin Dragon Explosion, which could create a dark black hole with its explosion. Even those who were stronger than Qing Shui could be torn apart by the black hole and thus disappear.</p>
 <p>The countenance of the three of them turned pale. They knew that they would definitely die today but they still held onto a hint of hope. "If I were to say it, would you let me go?" The young man bit his lips and said trembling. "You can't say it. We will die even if we do and we'll end up bringing down the entire clan," one of the old men said firmly.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>The old man who had spoke disappeared immediately, leaving behind an old man holding onto the young man. Otherwise, the young man would have fallen down to the ground.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>The young man's head was smashed by the last remaining old man and Qing Shui also sent out another Primordial Flame Ball without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>He disappeared from this barren land!</p>
 <p>Not long after Qing Clan left, the people from Wan Clan rushed over. When they saw the three dead Black Feather Cranes, they knew that the group must have been killed. A middle-aged man in the lead stood there, frowning.</p>
 <p>"Two of the Black Feather Cranes died from their hearts exploding. There are no traces of them engaging in battle. It seems like they've been suppressed by the Qi of an expert and killed," after taking a look, an old man said softly.</p>
 <p>"Even an ordinary Peak Martial Saint would find it hard to use Qi to kill Peak Martial King demonic beasts." The middle-aged man frowned, shaking his head.</p>
 <p>"Go back and check who Young Master has offended. Let's go!" The middle-aged man frowned but there was no sign of grief on his face.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>By this time, Qing Shui had already arrived in another city. However, he had no intention of staying. He wanted to get to Eastern Victory Divine Continent as soon as possible. The journey was not short and even with the current Fire Bird and Nine Continents Steps, it would still take a very long time, at least half a year or more. Moreover, even if he had reached the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, he still needed to head to the eastmost point of the Eastern Victory Divine Continent.</p>
 <p>When it was dark, Qing Shui found that he had once again arrived in the wilderness between two cities. Looking at the time, he directly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui could not even be bothered to set up his tent. After he had stayed long enough in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would continue on his way straightaway, even if it was at night.</p>
 <p>The moment he entered, Qing Shui picked up the Spirit Gathering Lamp.</p>
 <p>It felt very heavy and gave off a strong aura. This gave him a comfortable feeling. The only thing was that Qing Shui felt that this Spirit Gathering Lamp was very tattered and old.</p>
 <p>Temper!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started to temper it but before he did, he instinctively looked at it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Spirit Gathering Lamp！</p>
 <p>It was an ancient piece and the user could increase the spiritual energy of all tamed beasts which were engaged in battle, causing the attack prowess of the beast tamer's skills to increase. The increase was related to its grade. Passive treasure, zero energy expenditure!</p>
 <p>It was currently at grade zero!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not expected this to be the same as the Spirit Gathering Lamp he knew of. The only thing which he found regretful was that its grade was too low. But thinking about it, if its grade was high, just the powerful spiritual energy it exuded would let people feel that it was no ordinary item. Therefore, he should be happy that it was at grade zero.</p>
 <p>Usually, the time required for him to temper something, to bring it from grade zero to grade one, was very short, therefore Qing Shui did not wish to waste any time. He quickly went through one round. With the time ratio in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal increased greatly, he hoped that by the time he had reached the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, the Spirit Gathering Lamp would reach a good grade.</p>
 <p>He did not know if it was because his abilities had increased or if there were other reasons. Now, Qing Shui could temper each of these treasures for twenty times daily!</p>
 <p>During the process of tempering, a faint dark green glow was emitted by the Spirit Gathering Lamp. However, as it was still blocked by the impurities on the surface, only hints of green light could be seen. Just by looks alone, it was hard to relate this to a treasure.</p>
