 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui observed the leading woman. She should be around her 40’s. However, Qing Shui was unable to figure out her actual age. She seemed very elegant. Though middle-aged, she was still quite an attractive woman. Her make-up seemed a bit thick and she was staring at Qing Shui arrogantly. Moreover, she was the one who said the bad things before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman’s eyes seemed a bit arrogant. Her thin lips were colored very brightly and she had a very sexy figure. However, she kept giving people a feeling that she was an arrogant bully. It was like she thought that no one could ever be as good as her and that a lot of people owed it to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” Qing Shui smiled and asked. Deep down, he was actually hoping that this woman wouldn’t be Zheng Xuan’s mother. If Qing Bei was to get married to the Zheng Clan and had a mother-in-law like this, she would definitely be doomed with bad luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me? He is my man. Then let me ask you back a question, who do you think I am?” The woman pointed at Zheng Xuan’s grandfather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This surprised Qing Shui. No wonder the woman dared act so arrogantly. So she was the grandmother of the Zheng Clan. However, Qing Shui knew that this woman only possessed decent strength; there wa no way she knew about the Youth Retaining Arts. Thus, there was no way that she was the rightful wife of this old man, because there was no way she would be able to give birth to a child like Zheng Babai, nor was she old enough to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui curiously looked at the old man from the Zheng Clan. This old geezer must have been a very horny man. To think that he would still marry a woman like this even at his current age. Could he take it? No matter how he looked at the woman, it was obvious that she seemed dissatisfied by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zheng Clan, at first, I thought that it was a decent clan. But now, I feel that it is no different from ordinary clans.” Qing Shui shook his head and said while looking at the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is he? He dares insult our Zheng Clan?” A woman said in a very soft tone. However, everyone in the surroundings could hear her clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is someone from the Qing Clan, the clan members of Little Xuan’s girlfriend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, so they are trying to climb their way up to the Zheng Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you think so? Little Xuan is such an outstanding man. It is anyone’s luck to get married to Little Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui listened to the voices that were discussing this matter. The majority of them were women. This made Qing Shui feel that they all possessed very poor knowledge despite having their long hairs. However, it was undeniable that the people of the Zheng Clan had enough assets to act so arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, so, it’s you people from the Qing Clan. What’s wrong? Have you guys come to propose marriage?” The young grandmother from the Zheng Clan said with a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, Zheng Clan is not good enough for my Little Bei. You all are just cowards forced to hide in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. What do you guys have which you can be proud of?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the old man’s face changed. He shot a cold glare at Qing Shui and went on to tell the people in the surroundings, “All of you, shut up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, the old man looked at Qing Shui, “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the old man’s reaction, Qing Shui knew that even if he didn’t guess accurately, he would have gotten at least 80 to 90% right. Hence he smiled and responded, “The people from the Zheng Clan seemed very arrogant. However, deep in their body, I can feel some resentments being suppressed and they were coming from embarrassments. The fact that you guys migrated here, if I am not wrong, was because you were forced out of your former place. Though you guys might act very humbly, you were unable to hide the embarrassments and resentments you held within your heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense! I would like to see what assets you have to act so arrogantly in front of the Zheng Clan!” At this moment, a middle-aged man walked out. He looked very firm and handsome and looked a bit like Zheng Babai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle, Brother Qing Shui didn’t harbor any bad intentions. Please treat him more politely and sit down to discuss the matters.” Zheng Xuan knitted his brows and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Xuan, you are a member of the Zheng Clan, you must put us as your priority. Listen to me, cut ties with the Qing Clan, we will get you a woman with an even better background to be your wife.” The man slightly knitted his brows. His gazes were mixing with a trace of cold smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Xuan looked at Qing Shui, “I am so sorry Brother Qing Shui, but rest assured, if I really get married to Little Bei, I will definitely not let her be wronged like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Xuan, do you really not put me, your grandmother in your eyes?” The woman said in a grumpy tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My grandma had passed away!” Zheng Xuan said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Xuan, in any case, I am still considered your senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t feel like I have said the wrong thing. My grandma has indeed passed away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. It seemed this woman must have been quite isolated from the Zheng Clan. She was just bluffing around by relying on her name as the “paternal grandmother”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Clan seemed a bit complicated. Their problem was only that their forces were divided into few parts. For example, Zheng Xuan’s uncle from before, he definitely hoped that Zheng Xuan could have a marriage which could unite the Zheng Clan with the other great aristocratic clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another thing that Qing Shui could confirm was that the Zheng Clan must have been forced out here by a certain group of people. Who exactly could be strong enough to force the Zheng Clan to a corner? Qing Shui was really curious about it. Nevertheless, it had nothing to do with him. Right now, Qing Shui was very upset with the old man from the Zheng Clan. Despite his old age, he seemed a bit blind when it came to judging a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am getting old. It has been a long time since I last get involved in the matters regarding the Zheng Clan. And now, I would like to take a nap.” The old man smiled as he tried to make a joke before turning around to go back to his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. This old man was a true masterpiece! When Qing Shui first came in, he already felt that this old man was not a simple person. Not only did he have a thick face, but it has also gone to the point that he even seemed a bit shameless. However, this was usually how tricky old guys would behave. They had seen through everything. For example, even if Qing Shui was to call the Zheng Clan a coward, the old man also wouldn’t enrage by it. Now that he thought about himself, he was still quite young and energetic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui’s feeling was right. Even if the old man didn’t do anything, there would still be a few good-for-nothing people in the Zheng Clan. For instance, the unkind woman and the uncle from the Zheng Clan. If he truly let Qing Bei get married into the Zheng Clan, he must make sure that he took care of these people first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a handsome middle-aged man came out and approached Qing Shui, “I am Zheng Shizhen, Little Xuan’s father. Welcome to the Zheng Clan. Let’s talk at my place!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Shizhen had a gentle face. He didn’t seem to be that great when it came to his cultivation. In fact, he might be even weaker than Zheng Xuan.</span></p>

Please stop arguing about this.” At this moment, Zheng Babai said with a smile.</span></p>

Let us settle it with fists.”</span></p>

Without saying anything further, he immediately charged towards Qing Shui. The others, on the other hand, instinctively spread out to create space for the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man had a feeling that no matter how powerful this immature brat might be, he should not pose too much of a challenge to him. He was aware that he was already at the late Sixth level of Divinity. He had the feeling that this brat would not be more powerful than Zheng Xuan. Since Zheng Xuan was the one with the most outstanding talent for his generation and considering that his own strength had surpassed that of Zheng Xuan’s, it should take him no longer than one breath to finish this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there was no way he could see through Qing Shui’s exact strength… The early stage of Divinity was all he could sense from Qing Shui’s body. Or in some scenarios, the opponents might only sense him at the peak False God realm. Though in many people’s eyes, this was already an existence which surpassed God. In his perspective, this could only be considered as decent and at the very least, more powerful than the majority of the people. Still, it was very far away when compared to Zheng Xuan. After all, once a person reached the False God Realm, any of the grades they reached might be their limit in cultivations. In other words, every time one ascended up to a new grade, there was up to 80% chance that he or she would no longer be able to progress further in their cultivations.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon-capturing hands!</span></p>

He managed to fill Zheng Xuan’s uncle’s face with dust in just one clash. And this was not all, fresh blood could also be seen dripping down from the corner of his mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One move and one clash were all it took…..</span></p>

After all, Qing Shui greatly surpassed his opponent in terms of strength. If he had wanted to, he could have very easily killed him in an instant.</span></p>
