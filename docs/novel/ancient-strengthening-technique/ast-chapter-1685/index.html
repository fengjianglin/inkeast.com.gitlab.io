 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that after a discussion with the females, they realized this wasn’t good. If they did so, it would mean that they looked down on the two elders, not treating them truly as one of their own. If that was the case, how could the other members truly feel that the Sunset Palace was their family?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought about it and sighed with emotion. He had experienced many battles in his life and right now, he realized that most of the time, he was always fighting alone. Even his women rarely fought together with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, although the disparity between their strengths was larger apart, it was still possible for them all to fight together. Qing Shui realised that he wanted to keep on fighting together with his companions in the future. Only by fighting together would the feeling of camaraderie come about. Not only did he plan to fight together with his women in the future, he wanted to fight together with his friends as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true… In that case, okay then, we will allow Old Jin and Old Mo to participate as well.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Old Jin and Old Mo learned of the news, they were in fact extremely happy. Qing Shui didn’t even have time to look for them before they showed up looking for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was someone who respected the old. In the Sunset Palace, Old Jin and Old Mo were considered the leaders of their races and both had extremely high statuses. Even Qing Shui and the three palace mistresses had to respect them. Naturally, they were both also people deserving of respect. Respecting the old and cherishing the young was a kind of virtue, and although decisions on major matters were still made by the palace mistresses, the elders could add their two cents as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although things were said this way, only those at the top had absolute authority in powerful sects or aristocrat clans. Strength was everything. The attitude of the one with strength determined everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sirs, why are you both here?” When Qing Shui saw the two old men, he stood up warm-heartedly to welcome them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mister Qing.” We heard that the leaders would allow us to participate in this war against the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. We wonder if this is true?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man who spoke had a sturdy build. Although his hair had gone white, his aura was incomparably vast and intense. When he walked, the sound of his steps created a slight sonic boom, like a heavy pressure slamming into the earth. This old man was none other than Jin Guizi, a supreme expert of the Diamond Immortal Turtle race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other old man had an extremely dark skin tone and was very burly. His eyes were filled with the vicissitudes of time and glinted with determination. He smiled and stared at Qing Shui with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I just wanted to go look for you guys. I wonder if you two old sirs are willing to fight?” Qing Shui invited them to sit as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing we want more. It has been so long since we last fought. No matter what, we have to participate this time.” Old Mo hurriedly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Martial cultivators lived with their lives on the line every day. Although they couldn’t say they were born to do battle, it was an undeniable fact that combat was a very frequent part of their lives and that they might die at any time. Just like a saying in his past life - humans in the pugilist world are unable to control their fate. Warriors would battle constantly and didn’t even have leeway for a single mistake. Nobody had the confidence to say they would win their next battle for sure and continue to live on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s excellent. That’s our intent as well. I will have to trouble you two sirs then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mister, you are too polite. We are a part of the Sunset Palace; it’s naturally our mission to defend this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too long later, the two old men departed. Qing Shui could also tell that this was necessary. Although sometimes not letting them join the battle was a way of protecting them, there were many cultivators who weren’t willing to hide somewhere and wait for their deaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed by very quickly. In just a short while, three days had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and the Sunset Palace Mistress, Muyun Qingge, Old Jin and Old Mo brought along some people and appeared in a location not that far away from the Sunset Palace. There were many sunken mountains around the area, just like a ravine. However, this ravine was too vast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange also came. However, Qing Shui didn’t allow her to participate in the battle. Qing Shui was confident, which was why he didn’t stop Yiye Jiange from coming. There was still quite many experts who came from the Sunset Sea King Palace. After all, the distance was not far and many experts from the other powers came as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The timing in which they arrived wasn’t too early. The people from the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace were already here. He felt that in terms of understanding each other’s power, their opponent had more of an advantage. However, this was only on the surface. In reality, because Qing Shui’s Violet Jade Immortal Realm had reached the peak ninth level, his strength once again explosively increased. This was something nobody knew about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stared at the people of the Dragonwolf Palace. The one in the lead was a middle-aged man who resembled a human. He had a muscular figure and his most outstanding features were both his eyes and his forehead. The eyes of this middle-aged man were bright and sharp, containing a hint of imposingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only him, the others behind him all had the same special characteristic. This should be the unique characteristic of dragonwolves?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, that man in the lead is none other than the third palace master of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. He is a great genius of the palace, with overwhelming talent and who is also wise and cautious. He is very powerful; his attacks are sharp and sinister. You must take special note of him during combat,” the Sunset Palace Mistress reminded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded his head. It seemed like the Sunset Palace Mistress had also received some news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Behind him, the two old men are the protectors of the Dragonwolf Palace. The main point is that the two of them are brothers and can cooperate seamlessly, causing their power to increase exponentially.” The palace mistress continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui glanced at the two old men as he listened. Those two looked like classic dragonwolves but their faces were all wrinkled due to their age. Their eyes seemed somewhat listless and there was a lack of spirit in them as well. However, an extremely baleful aura would gush forth from their bodies occasionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that there are still plenty of top-tier experts in the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are much stronger compared to the North Sea Dragon King Palace. Actually, without you, we wouldn’t have any confidence of victory if we fought against the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace,” The palace mistress smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You girls are so confident in me?” Qing Shui stared at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, with you here. I’m not afraid no matter who I have to fight against.” Muyun Qingge then added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui awkwardly rubbed his nose. He saw Muyun Qingge smiling at him while winking mischievously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was just an ordinary action but when a woman as beautiful as Muyun Qingge did it, there was a fatal attractive power. Her snow-like skin was soft and supple. Right now, she even seemed to emit a jade-like halo that was like the blooming of a resplendent flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge stared at Qing Shui who had fallen into a daze as he watched her. She suddenly blushed and shot out her hand silently to pinch him. After all, there were people around them, and there were many who were monitoring his movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did Qing Shui return to his senses. Muyun Qingge retracted her hand, but the blush was still on her face.
