 <p><strong>Chapter 526 Strength of the Heart of Seven Orifices, Absolute Genius.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 526 - Strength of the Heart of Seven Orifices, Absolute Genius</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not do anything, instead he quietly listened.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“When it came to my generation, the Yiye Clan had almost reached the thousand year juncture, following the previous pattern there should be another person born with the Heart of Seven Orifices. The Ridge Master of Lion King's Ridge wanted to ally with the Yiye Clan to make them work for him. However, they’d had other intentions. The Lion King's Ridge focused their attention on my generation of the Yiye Clan, unfortunately, my aptitude was pretty good when I was young, thus they secretly set restrictions on me. Little did they know, that the one with the Heart of Seven Orifices would be my brother’s daughter, Luan Luan…” It could not be told whether Yiye Jiange said that in grief or joy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not surprised when he heard all of this, this kind of situation was very normal. Not to mention the alliance between the Lion King's Ridge and Yiye Clan, even if the Yiye Clan was subservient to the Lion King's Ridge, Lion King's Ridge would still choose to suppress the geniuses of that generation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They would not allow anyone under them to be stronger than them, even if it did not impact them and caused trouble for other people, selfishness was the innate nature of humans.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once Yiye Jiange’s restrictions were released, her strength rose to almost the strength of one country. Qing Shui was speechless at the sight of her aptitude. Even under the restrictions she could still accumulate a cultivation of that level, and she was even able to attain a &nbsp;strength equivalent to that of a Xiantian cultivator under the restrictions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is Master waiting for Luan Luan to grow up first before going to Lion King's Ridge?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I do not know either. No one has any idea with regards to what extent the Heart of Seven Orifices can grow to, there are only legends. If she really could grow to that level, then maybe we can go and try, but it would depend on what Luan Luan wants.” Yiye Jiange looked into the distance, her gaze was not shaken, she was calm as water.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that peaceful gaze, that gaze lacking desire, Qing Shui felt uncomfortable because everyone had desires, once someone lost their desires, it would be like losing hope…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If Master wished to go, when the time comes, let’s go together, alright?” Qing Shui said calmly. This counted as him formally giving her a promise. Qing Shui felt that there was hope, just that it would take time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange turned her head to look at Qing Shui, then looked to the side and said, “There is still some time if you still want to come then…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan is my daughter, and also… Master’s daughter…” Qing Shui scratched his head, suddenly feeling that it had become complicated…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was startled by his words, she laughed and looked at Qing Shui, “I think it’s best you don’t address me as Master, we never did had a master-disciple relationship in the first place. We were only forced by the circumstances then to adopt such a relationship.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ming!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly there was a bird cry, it was Luan Luan returning on ‘Bai Bai’, when she saw Qing Shui she happily shouted, “Daddy…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw the happy expression of Luan Luan, he was naturally happy too. Qing Shui did not notice that Yiye Jiange had an intoxicating smile on her face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When it was no longer that high, the young girl directly jumped off Bai Bai’s back, and Qing Shui quickly caught her. The young girl was now 9 years old, it had been 5 years since they’d first met. Her height did not change much, so she was still as cute as she was then, looking very similar to Yiye Jiange, a devastatingly beautiful woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother!” Luan Luan greeted Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They hadn’t met in three years!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father, you are finally willing to come see Mother and me.” Luan Luan hugged Qing Shui's neck and pouted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, they did not know how he had lived in the past three years. However, some father he was, despite acknowledging her as his daughter, he had not taken responsibility for it. All he had done was to let her know that she had parents, to let her feel loved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father had many things to do, but Father is here to bring you home this time. Will you go back with Father? That way you can see Father more frequently.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange stared at Qing Shui in shock, even she did not know what was Qing Shui planning.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not just saying it, let’s not to mention whether she would think if it was real. Qing Shui had the intention of bringing her back for a period of time to get her to interact with more people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Really? Father will really bring me back?” Luan Luan opened her crystal-like eyes wide and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“When has Father ever lied to you, let us go back together with your mother, it will be very lively.” Qing Shui kissed Luan Luan’s cheeks as he laughed. Qing Shui just realized he had made a very big mistake, it was that he had never brought the young girl home before…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes! Yes... Mother, can we go?” Luan Luan said joyfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange smiled and stretched her hands out to pinch Luan Luan’s nose and said, “Sure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Both Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange held Luan Luan’s hands as they made their way down the mountain top. To those who did not know, they would say that they were a blessed family.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, how is your cultivation now?” Qing Shui casually asked Luan Luan as he smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Great Perfection Stage of Deer Cantering, Great Perfection Stage of the Tiger Form, Great Perfection Stage of the Bear Form, Large Success Stage of the Crane Form, not too sure about the Back Connecting Fist,” Luan Luan said impressively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange, she gently nodded. Luan Luan was only 9 years old. This Heart of Seven Orifices was indeed very strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, let Father see!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the Deer Cantering to the Soaring Crane Steps from the Crane Form! Qing Shui was extremely satisfied even with her attainments with the Tiger Form.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, the young girl was displaying the Back Connecting Fist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Each time her small arms struck out, there was a weak fluctuation in the air. Qing Shui was stunned as he watched that small figure’s motions in detail, from her back to her arms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like Qing Bei… She had reached the Truth Realm at such a young age…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he brought her back to the Qing Clan, it would put that group of fellows to shame.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared blankly and in shock as he watched Luan Luan finished displaying the Back Connecting Fist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father, how did Luan Luan do?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Luan Luan finished displaying the Back Connecting Fist, she came up to Qing Shui seeking his praises.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Good! Good! Good!” Qing Shui, who did not normally praise people, could not help but say ‘good’ three times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then is there any rewards?” The young girl opened her eyes wide and noisily ran around Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“In a while, I will help you to do something you can’t imagine, I guarantee that you will like it. Take this first, give it to your ‘Bai Bai’, ‘Hui Hui’ and the others to eat, it would make them stronger.” Qing Shui handed a bottle with tens of Beast Pill over to Luan Luan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan happily took it, the girl was very intelligent, after receiving the beast pills, she happily winked at Qing Shui and then cried out in the distance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, the earlier big bird, a big bear and a huge snow white tiger ran over!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, your father gave you a big peach, see if it tastes nice.” &nbsp;Yiye Jiange gave the Peach of Immortality to Luan Luan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Woah! What a big peach!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, you should have some!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father, have some too!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This can only be eaten by you, after eating it, it will make your cultivation stronger, there are no effects for adults.” Qing Shui Said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like that, Luan Luan finished the whole peach, she then patted her belly and said, “Is it really tasty?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There can only be one after every few hundred of years, how can it not taste nice…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, find a quiet place and eat this.” Qing Shui gave Luan Luan a Tiger Vitality Pill, to the current Luan Luan, this Tiger Vitality Pill was very strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An ordinary adult could only carry 300 jins, one Tiger Vitality Pill could increase strength by 1000 Jin. But if the age was too young, and the bones were too thin, the effects would be reduced, to the point where it might not even increase 100 Jin of strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, there was a kind of ordinary strengthening pill, the “Strength Increasing Pill” for mortals. Each person can only take five, each pill increased strength by 100 jin. Its price was reasonable, thus every adult male in the World of the Nine Continents would have taken Strength Increasing Pill before, this was also the pill with the highest demand in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a good thing that most alchemists were able to refine this kind of pill, the herbs it required were very ordinary too.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan was the most talented genius Qing Shui had ever seen, whether it was aptitude, bones or comprehension, they were the best he had seen. The strength of this young lass was pretty good already, in a few years, she would shock everyone. This was a true genius, a true absolute genius. Qing Shui thought of himself, he had a heaven-defying treasure, and his aptitude was very much inferior to Luan Luan’s.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only left Yiye Jiange after Luan Luan had fallen asleep. Fortunately, he had already used up all his time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had known that he would not have much time today.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The night wind was very cooling, Yiye Jiange sent Qing Shui off.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It is late already, go have some rest!” Qing Shui stopped and told Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, are you really going to bring Luan Luan back?” Yiye Jiange asked quietly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, she is quite lonely here, there is also you. I will be staying at the Qing Clan for a while, I can use this time to teach the young lass some things. Let’s go back together, alright?” Qing Shui said as he faced Yiye Jianhe.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was also very lonely here, thus Qing Shui wanted to bring her and Luan Luan to the Qing Clan to stay for some time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not return to his residence in Cloud Mist Peak, but instead he went to Zhu Qing’s courtyard, he had not seen her for a few years, Qing Shui was not sure what he felt about this mature women, he had missed her a little, but the feeling was not strong, he just had some affection for her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was late in the night when Qing Shui walked into that familiar courtyard. He realized that there was a dim light coming from the room, Qing Shui slowly went in, the door was not locked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the Zhu Qing Peak of Skysword Sect, there were only female disciples. Furthermore, Zhu Qing was an elder of the Skysword Sect, no one would dare to have errant thoughts about her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gently pushed the door open, almost at the same time, the door to the bedroom opened. Zhu Qing was standing there, dressed in her nightgown. When she saw Qing Shui, she revealed a happy expression, then ran towards Qing Shui and embraced him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I knew you would come here, I’ve missed you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the charming women, her expression was full of joy. He gently hugged her, “I've missed you too!”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was startled by his words, she laughed and looked at Qing Shui, “I think it’s best you don’t address me as Master, we never did had a master-disciple relationship in the first place. We were only forced by the circumstances then to adopt such a relationship.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ming!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly there was a bird cry, it was Luan Luan returning on ‘Bai Bai’, when she saw Qing Shui she happily shouted, “Daddy…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw the happy expression of Luan Luan, he was naturally happy too. Qing Shui did not notice that Yiye Jiange had an intoxicating smile on her face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When it was no longer that high, the young girl directly jumped off Bai Bai’s back, and Qing Shui quickly caught her. The young girl was now 9 years old, it had been 5 years since they’d first met. Her height did not change much, so she was still as cute as she was then, looking very similar to Yiye Jiange, a devastatingly beautiful woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother!” Luan Luan greeted Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They hadn’t met in three years!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father, you are finally willing to come see Mother and me.” Luan Luan hugged Qing Shui's neck and pouted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, they did not know how he had lived in the past three years. However, some father he was, despite acknowledging her as his daughter, he had not taken responsibility for it. All he had done was to let her know that she had parents, to let her feel loved.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father had many things to do, but Father is here to bring you home this time. Will you go back with Father? That way you can see Father more frequently.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange stared at Qing Shui in shock, even she did not know what was Qing Shui planning.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not just saying it, let’s not to mention whether she would think if it was real. Qing Shui had the intention of bringing her back for a period of time to get her to interact with more people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Really? Father will really bring me back?” Luan Luan opened her crystal-like eyes wide and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“When has Father ever lied to you, let us go back together with your mother, it will be very lively.” Qing Shui kissed Luan Luan’s cheeks as he laughed. Qing Shui just realized he had made a very big mistake, it was that he had never brought the young girl home before…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes! Yes... Mother, can we go?” Luan Luan said joyfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange smiled and stretched her hands out to pinch Luan Luan’s nose and said, “Sure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Both Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange held Luan Luan’s hands as they made their way down the mountain top. To those who did not know, they would say that they were a blessed family.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, how is your cultivation now?” Qing Shui casually asked Luan Luan as he smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Great Perfection Stage of Deer Cantering, Great Perfection Stage of the Tiger Form, Great Perfection Stage of the Bear Form, Large Success Stage of the Crane Form, not too sure about the Back Connecting Fist,” Luan Luan said impressively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange, she gently nodded. Luan Luan was only 9 years old. This Heart of Seven Orifices was indeed very strong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, let Father see!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the Deer Cantering to the Soaring Crane Steps from the Crane Form! Qing Shui was extremely satisfied even with her attainments with the Tiger Form.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, the young girl was displaying the Back Connecting Fist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Each time her small arms struck out, there was a weak fluctuation in the air. Qing Shui was stunned as he watched that small figure’s motions in detail, from her back to her arms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like Qing Bei… She had reached the Truth Realm at such a young age…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he brought her back to the Qing Clan, it would put that group of fellows to shame.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared blankly and in shock as he watched Luan Luan finished displaying the Back Connecting Fist!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father, how did Luan Luan do?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Luan Luan finished displaying the Back Connecting Fist, she came up to Qing Shui seeking his praises.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Good! Good! Good!” Qing Shui, who did not normally praise people, could not help but say ‘good’ three times.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then is there any rewards?” The young girl opened her eyes wide and noisily ran around Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“In a while, I will help you to do something you can’t imagine, I guarantee that you will like it. Take this first, give it to your ‘Bai Bai’, ‘Hui Hui’ and the others to eat, it would make them stronger.” Qing Shui handed a bottle with tens of Beast Pill over to Luan Luan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan happily took it, the girl was very intelligent, after receiving the beast pills, she happily winked at Qing Shui and then cried out in the distance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon, the earlier big bird, a big bear and a huge snow white tiger ran over!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, your father gave you a big peach, see if it tastes nice.” &nbsp;Yiye Jiange gave the Peach of Immortality to Luan Luan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Woah! What a big peach!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, you should have some!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father, have some too!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This can only be eaten by you, after eating it, it will make your cultivation stronger, there are no effects for adults.” Qing Shui Said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like that, Luan Luan finished the whole peach, she then patted her belly and said, “Is it really tasty?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There can only be one after every few hundred of years, how can it not taste nice…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, find a quiet place and eat this.” Qing Shui gave Luan Luan a Tiger Vitality Pill, to the current Luan Luan, this Tiger Vitality Pill was very strong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An ordinary adult could only carry 300 jins, one Tiger Vitality Pill could increase strength by 1000 Jin. But if the age was too young, and the bones were too thin, the effects would be reduced, to the point where it might not even increase 100 Jin of strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, there was a kind of ordinary strengthening pill, the “Strength Increasing Pill” for mortals. Each person can only take five, each pill increased strength by 100 jin. Its price was reasonable, thus every adult male in the World of the Nine Continents would have taken Strength Increasing Pill before, this was also the pill with the highest demand in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a good thing that most alchemists were able to refine this kind of pill, the herbs it required were very ordinary too.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan was the most talented genius Qing Shui had ever seen, whether it was aptitude, bones or comprehension, they were the best he had seen. The strength of this young lass was pretty good already, in a few years, she would shock everyone. This was a true genius, a true absolute genius. Qing Shui thought of himself, he had a heaven-defying treasure, and his aptitude was very much inferior to Luan Luan’s.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only left Yiye Jiange after Luan Luan had fallen asleep. Fortunately, he had already used up all his time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had known that he would not have much time today.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The night wind was very cooling, Yiye Jiange sent Qing Shui off.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It is late already, go have some rest!” Qing Shui stopped and told Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, are you really going to bring Luan Luan back?” Yiye Jiange asked quietly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En, she is quite lonely here, there is also you. I will be staying at the Qing Clan for a while, I can use this time to teach the young lass some things. Let’s go back together, alright?” Qing Shui said as he faced Yiye Jianhe.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange was also very lonely here, thus Qing Shui wanted to bring her and Luan Luan to the Qing Clan to stay for some time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not return to his residence in Cloud Mist Peak, but instead he went to Zhu Qing’s courtyard, he had not seen her for a few years, Qing Shui was not sure what he felt about this mature women, he had missed her a little, but the feeling was not strong, he just had some affection for her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was late in the night when Qing Shui walked into that familiar courtyard. He realized that there was a dim light coming from the room, Qing Shui slowly went in, the door was not locked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the Zhu Qing Peak of Skysword Sect, there were only female disciples. Furthermore, Zhu Qing was an elder of the Skysword Sect, no one would dare to have errant thoughts about her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gently pushed the door open, almost at the same time, the door to the bedroom opened. Zhu Qing was standing there, dressed in her nightgown. When she saw Qing Shui, she revealed a happy expression, then ran towards Qing Shui and embraced him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I knew you would come here, I’ve missed you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the charming women, her expression was full of joy. He gently hugged her, “I've missed you too!”</p>
