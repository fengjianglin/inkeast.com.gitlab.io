 <p><strong>AST 1276 - Strength, Qing Shui’s Deterrence</strong></p>
 <p>Right outside in a distance near the Lotus Sect, Qing Shui had begun exchanging fists with the sect lord of the Lotus Sect. He felt that he had very likely enraged the old lady which led to her making a big fuss over things. Originally, there were a few other disciples from the Lotus Sect who came forward to aid her in battles. However, they were all excoriated by the old lady to go back in.</p>
 <p>“Why must you be so stubborn? I’m not asking for anything too excessive. I just want you to give me back my woman.” The longer Qing Shui fought, the more natural he felt when he unleashed his techniques. The sect lord on the other hand, felt more and more uncomfortable as the fight continued. Qing Shui was like an agile fish in the water, she was unable to catch him no matter what.</p>
 <p>“In your dream! I won’t let you harm Chen`Er! She is still young, she doesn’t know what’s right and wrong. It’s best if you give up your intention to have her. Seeing that you’re also Chen`Er’s friend, I won’t put you in a difficult situation.” The old lady had already unleashed up to 80% of her strength and yet, she realized that she was still unable to stop Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>Single Whip!</p>
 <p>Every single one of his strikes were works of arts which could surpass even nature and were incomparably exquisite. At the moment, the attack prowess of Qing Shui’s Taichi Fist become even stronger as the strength provided by the Big Dipper Sword had been transmitted all around his body. Even though he was bare-handed, he had a strength equivalent to when he had the Big Dipper Sword with him.</p>
 <p>Deep down, the sect lord of the Lotus Sect was extremely startled. With her own weapon in hand, she realized that she was still unable to stop Qing Shui. A flame which couldn’t be explained in words got ignited within her heart.</p>
 <p>Flame Lotus!</p>
 <p>An enormous Flame Lotus burst open around the old lady’s body. The aura that was emitted from her body gained an incredible raise. After that, the weapon in her hand, to Qing Shui’s surprise, had turned into a Lotus Flower. Its body was covered entirely with a fiery, red color and gave out a powerful life force like it was alive.</p>
 <p>Lotus Flower’s Manifestation!</p>
 <p>The old lady roared loudly. As she swung the lotus above her head, crimson-colored lotus appeared in the surroundings one after another out of nowhere. They were huge like the cast of the face. Each of them emitted a tyrannical energy fluctuation.</p>
 <p>Lotus Flower’s Convergence, Explosion!</p>
 <p>More than ten Lotus Flowers gathered up around him. They locked onto him with their powerful Spiritual Sense. Qing Shui felt a chill around his spine at that moment at the thought that this old witch really wanted him to die.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui had the Arhat Rosary Bead. Hence, these attacks that could most likely be considered as a Spirit Energy Attacks were something which he could withstand. Nevertheless, he didn’t really want to take such risk. As he operated his Spirit Energy, the Nine Continent’s Mountains appeared in front of him and cancelled out more than half of the attack.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>The old lady unleashed a ray of Flame Lotus and collided it against the Primordial Flame Dragon Whip!</p>
 <p>The strength of the Primordial Flame Dragon Whip seemed to be slightly weaker than that of the opponent’s Flame Lotus, hence, it immediately got melted. However, as Qing Shui shaked his hand, the Primordial Flame Dragon Whip immediately changed its course and whipped in another direction.</p>
 <p>Pa! Pa!…...</p>
 <p>A concentrated series of sounds from the exploding attack came through due powerful energy clashes. Qing Shui’s body could be seen to be constantly adjusting as he tried to dissolve the remaining offensive prowess within his body.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>This time, the Primordial Flame Dragon Whip looked incomparably bright. He immediately pushed the old lady backwards. Qing Shui didn’t feel weird about it as the chances to double the attack prowess had been met. With the tyrannical Primordial Flame Dragon Whip, he had managed to push back the old lady quite a distance away.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui hadn’t yet encountered any life-or-death matches in general. However, it was unknown whether the old lady had already truly intended to kill Qing Shui or she had unknowingly placed him on the same level as herself.</p>
 <p>“Spill it, what do you want to agree to my suggestion? Di Chen will definitely follow me in her entire life. It’s ok if you want her to take over the Lotus Sect, but with the condition that it won’t destroy the relationship between me and her.” Qing Shui said casually.</p>
 <p>“Damned brat, don’t even think about it!” The old lady constantly unleashed attacks from her hands. She had a really firm attitude.</p>
 <p>“I am currently still really young. Furthermore, I might be able to help the Lotus Sect expand across the entire continent in the future. Are you really not going to consider this? Let alone, do you think that you can stop me? Aren’t there a lot of people from your sect secretly meeting men without your consent? Even some of the elders behaved this way, don’t tell me you that didn't know about it. Are you trying to deceive yourself? What does this say, that the rules within your sect doesn’t really appeal to everyone? I think that it’s a good excuse to make a change.” While he spoke, Qing Shui begun to gradually slow down the movements of his hands.</p>
 <p>The old lady knew about all of these problems. It was just as what Qing Shui said, these problems would just repeat itself despite repeated prohibitions. Besides, she had also experienced it before. Even though she had been hurt once very deeply, she know that she wouldn’t feel delighted even if she killed him. On the contrary, she would feel lost.</p>
 <p>She observed the man in front of her. He was really young, really powerful, and also really bewitching. She reckoned that there would definitely be a lot of girls who like him. The fact that he dared to come here alone could tell the position that Di Chen held in his heart. Besides, how many women could truly stand shoulder-to-shoulder with girls like Di Chen? No matter which men managed to get her good grace, it would have already been more than enough to prove how outstanding he was.</p>
 <p>“How about this, you should be someone really powerful. If I managed to beat you, let's sit down and have a nice talk, how does this sound? Also, I can help Chen`Er and let her strength soar to the peak of the continent while leading the Lotus Sect. Don’t you want the Lotus Sect to appear in the Soaring Dragon Continent, the Dancing Phoenix Continent and the Haohan Continent? Don’t try to tell me that I am being really ignorant. I have both the confidence and the asset to say that.” Qing Shui stepped back and said.</p>
 <p>“Then we will talk about it after you beat me!” The old woman hesitated for a long time before she looked at Qing Shui and said. Previously, he said about helping Di Chen to become more powerful and let her, not him, lead the Lotus Sect. This meant that he was still someone with principle. If Qing Shui had spoken of the latter, she would have immediately denied everything about him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded. “Alright then, let us start!”</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui finished speaking, he summoned out the Fire Bird and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Under the State of One with Elephant, Qing Shui once again experienced a significant increase in strength. He still had the Diamond Sword Qi and immediately reduced the speed of the old lady once again. Qing Shui on the other hand, immediately condensed the Seal of Roc.</p>
 <p>As she witnessed Qing Shui’s current attack and felt her own current strength, the old lady felt extremely shocked in her heart. The gap in strength was too large. However, Qing Shui only condensed the Seal of Roc and didn’t release it. He was afraid that it might double in attack prowess and would instantly kill the old lady.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>The attacks of the Fire Bird was now almost a match against that of the old lady. Of course, it was the attack prowess of the Underworld Fireball. But in terms of receiving damage, the attacks of the old lady would be reduced by half by the Fire Bird. The attack prowess of the Underworld Fireball was really terrifying.</p>
 <p>Slowly, Qing Shui retrieved back his Seal of Roc.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I believe that you can already see the outcome of the battle. Truth to be told, the attack which I retrieved back before can achieve nearly 6,000 sun worth of strength. Furthermore, it also has a 10% chance to double its attack prowess. It will probably take me to only attack ten times for it to appear once. With your current strength, are you capable of blocking an attack worth around 10,000 sun?”</p>
 <p>To make the old woman believe him, Qing Shui immediately formed a seal with both hands and unleashed the Seal of Roc. After that, he repeated the same thing. With his abundant strength, he was now capable to constantly unleash the Seal of Roc. He had quite decent luck as on the seventh time he unleashed it, the effect of doubling his attack prowess appeared. The Seal of Roc he released this time was golden in colour. It gave out bright and dazzling light, as if it could lit up the entire sky. Compared to the previous Seal of Roc, its strength was obviously one time stronger. As for the old woman, she didn’t know how strong he was exactly, but her 6,000 sun worth of strength seemed to be inconsequential in the face of the golden roc aura.</p>
 <p>This fact could be considered to have already thoroughly crushed the old woman. This was a defeat she felt deep within her. She stared at Qing Shui as she thought just what kind of a monster he was. She was aware what the most powerful strength within the Western Oxhe Continent was. Hence, she immediately got frozen in shock by the strength which Qing Shui demonstrated.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned back the Fire Bird and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant then he just stood there. The sect lord of the Lotus Sect immediately lost her feeling of superiority. Before this, she felt that her opponent was just a disciple from an aristocratic clan. Compared to the Lotus Sect, he was nothing. However, now that he demonstrated his strength, any forces across the Western Oxhe Continent would have to give in to him wherever he went. He already had the strength to eliminate a sect unless they use the Grand Defense Formation</p>
 <p>If a sect would resort to use their Grand Defense Formation, once they used the formation, everything would be done for. Using the Grand Defense Formation would cause the sect to lose some of their powerful warriors. Just like this, the sect would eventually suffer great losses and get conquered by someone else.</p>
 <p>“Mr. Qing!”</p>
 <p>The way the old lady addressed Qing Shui now changed. It wasn’t really unusual as across the continents, one’s strength was equivalent to how much respect they could get.</p>
 <p>“I’m a junior. You can just call me Qing Shui. You are Chen`Er’s master.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Well then, let’s sit down there and have a talk.” The old lady could feel that Qing Shui was being really sincere. She pointed at the stone pavilion not far away and said.</p>
 <p>No one would be able to stop Qing Shui if he was to forcefully take Di Chen and leave. The present him didn’t feel arrogant or anything just because of his strength or the fact that he beat the old lady. The old lady really admired Qing Shui’s earnest attitude and self-cultivation.</p>
 <p>The old lady didn’t actually think that Qing Shui was thirsting for the Lotus Sect. As for the thoughts of whether he was a pervert that wanted to sexually indiscriminate the Lotus Sect, all of these thoughts had also been rejected. Considering the old lady’s age, she would be able to sense something. With the young man’s strength, if he really wanted to do these, even she herself would really be unable to stop him.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, if you really insist on taking away Di Chen, the Lotus Sect will be really unable to stop you. Since this is the case, let’s sit down and talk through it like you suggested. Maybe you feel that I am an unreasonable, clueless, and stubborn old granny.” The old lady said slowly after she sat down with Di Chen and Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>In Qing Shui’s mind, he thought that she was precisely this kind of person. But verbally, he still said formally, “Why would you think so?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to be like this. I’d still prefer you to be like before and just say whatever you want.” The old lady shook her head and responded.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I am aware that the Lotus Sect has its own rules. But a sect cannot always stick to the same rules forever. Rules are dead, but humans are alive. Do living people really have to be choked to death by people who are already dead? Besides, these rules were made since a long time ago. Time has changed, as so the style of the continents. If the regulations of the sect will stay the same, it will definitely be disqualified eventually.”</p>
 <p>“Have you ever thought about this? The Lotus Sect was filled with beautiful women. For now, no one may dare to lay hands on it because it's strong. But I have heard rumors that a pair of geniuses have appeared within the Desolate Sect. Furthermore, they plan to conquer the entire Western Oxhe Continent. Think about it, what kind of people are those who are from the Desolate Sect. If those people really conquered the Western Oxhe Continent, have you ever thought about the fate of the Lotus Sect? Even if the Desolate Sect was unable to do anything, there will still be other sects who will try to do it.” Qing Shui stopped for a while before he continued speaking slowly.</p>
 <p>The old lady didn’t say anything. She fell into contemplation.</p>
 <p>“The Putuo Mountain from the Southern Sea was the same as the Lotus Sect but they wouldn’t restrict their disciples from getting married. The Putuo Mountain from the Southern Sea isn’t in the slightest inferior to the Lotus Sect in terms of everything. The people whom their disciples got married to were no ordinary people. Even though it is a bit jumbled up, this is how it is. The Putuo Mountain holds a very unique position and no one will dare to provoke them. This is because the network that they’re intertwined with is too huge and deep. Who will dare to offend them?”</p>
 <p>The old lady’s expression had begun to loosen up. She was already struggling.</p>
 <p>“Also, forbidding love between men and women is something which is against the natural law. Don’t you think that the Lotus Sect will be in danger if you do something like this?”</p>
