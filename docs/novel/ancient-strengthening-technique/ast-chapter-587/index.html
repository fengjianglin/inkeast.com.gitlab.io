 <p><strong>AST 587 - The Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection at the Great Perfection Stage! The insane passive battle skills!</strong></p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lived his peaceful life really efficiently. Other than cultivating, Qing Shui spent the rest of his time looking after his children. In the morning, he would practice his Taichi Fist. Occasionally, he would also guide the three generations of Qing Clan through their cultivation while carrying his children.</p>
 <p>During this one month, Qing Shui managed to stabilize his strength. Not only did he manage to stabilize the Sixth Heavenly Layer realm, he also managed to break through the Ancient Strengthening Technique to the 201 cycle. By breaking through the cycle, it helped him increased his strength by a million jin.</p>
 <p>The stronger one became, the more difficult it would be for them to continue progressing. It was relatively tough for a Martial Saint grade warrior to break through. Otherwise, things like a Martial Saint being stuck at the same grade for several tens of years wouldn’t happen.</p>
 <p>Also, recently Qing Shui felt that the skill was about to make another break through to the fifth level. On top of that, the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection of the elephant form had shown signs of breaking through. Qing Shui really looked forward to it.</p>
 <p>He had a lot of expectations for the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection. If the both of them could be like those of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Qing Shui would feel really satisfied.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked forward to passive skills more than he did the active skills. This was because passive skills were unlimited. Furthermore, he didn't need to purposely revolve it for it to work. The only thing they lacked was that they weren’t as predictable as active skills.</p>
 <p>Within this one month, what piqued Qing Shui’s interest was that Huoyun Liu-Li’s Golden Jade Rabbit once again went through another evolution. It grew from the original small size all the way to its current one metre. Qing Shui found it funny whenever he saw it using both of its thick and strong legs to hop and walk. Its strength took a huge leap to the Fifth grade Martial King stage. It was indeed an unusual being between heaven and earth. It was not common to see a rabbit achieving this kind of strength.</p>
 <p>This was still not the thing that shocked Qing Shui the most. What he was surprised about was the speed of the Golden Jade Rabbit. Its speed was so fast that it was comparable to a human warrior at the peak Martial King grade. Furthermore, it could hold even stuff with its front feet.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li made the Golden Jade Rabbit wear clothes. This brat had really high intelligence which could be compared to a child’s. Often, it would make people around it laugh. For instance, Qing Shui almost spat out blood when he saw the Golden Jade Rabbit wearing a skirt. It reminded him of a bunny girl.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan and Yu Chang would often pout somewhat every time they looked at Qing Shui. After all, ever since the two babies were born, Qing Shui hasn't been able to spend as much time with them. In actuality, Qing Shui had tried to spend as much time as possible to be with them. For example, accompanying them to cultivate and teaching them to read.</p>
 <p>In a flash, yet another year has passed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was cultivating madly in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was revolving the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection throughout his entire body. He could already feel the breakthrough of the elephant form.</p>
 <p>This was already his thirtieth day in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Golden light flashed all over Qing Shui’s body. The essence across his body had powerful fluctuations yet it seemed like it was concentrated on one spot.</p>
 <p>The good thing about the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was that as long as there was still time, it would definitely be safe. In other words, he wouldn't be interrupted when he was cultivating. Cultivation was the most effective if it was done with a calm mind. This was why a lot of the formidable warriors often looked for quiet or desolate places to cultivate. It was also because of this that Qing Shui’s Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was all the more better than the rest. None of them were safer and more reliable than the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal itself.</p>
 <p>Another two days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal passed. Qing Shui suddenly opened both of his eyes. Simultaneously, his body also started giving off a bright golden light. The Buddha statue behind him showed up once more. But Qing Shui was no longer surprised like before when he saw the Buddha statue.</p>
 <p>Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection reached the Great Perfection Stage!</p>
 <p>Without the need to revolve the Qi, a tremendous strength had already begun circulating around his body. Qing Shui immediately erupted with joy. It was just like the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Now, Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection had actually turn into formidable passive battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Since it was unlimited and he didn’t even need to operate them, he could just increase his physical strength and defense anytime he wished.</p>
 <p>Heaven defying! It was definitely a heaven defying passive battle technique!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that all his painstaking effort until now had been worth it. At this moment, he really didn't know how to describe the joy in his heart. He could only let out a long scream into the sky.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p>Immovable Mountains!</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>For the past one year, Qing Shui’s Ancient Strengthening Technique had already achieved the 225 cycle. One year in the outside world was equivalent to fifty years inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. On average, he would break through one cycle every two years.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s raw strength was currently worth 123 countries. As of now, by relying on his own strength throughout his body, he had already reachedabout 406 countries worth of strength. If he was to include the Violet Gold Divine Shield , the Big Dipper Sword and the Heavenly Talisman, his strength would be worth around 627 countries.</p>
 <p>If he was to go all out, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could easily confront a Fourth grade Martial Saint warrior. This was the result of Qing Shui’s night and day training this past one year.</p>
 <p>Of course, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal also played a major role. Considering that he also added in the effect of the Aroma Concentration Pill and the Spirit Concentrating Pill, it could be seen just how tough it was to cultivate the Ancient Strengthening Technique and Nine Animals Mimicry Technique.</p>
 <p>But now, everything was finally worth it. It didn't seem like he would lose even if he ran into a Fifth grade Martial Saint. It's just that even though Qing Shui knew that he would able to stand up against him, he felt that it still lacked in its wounding power. His real killer move was the Critical Damage ability of the Natural Moon Silk Cloth.</p>
 <p>The Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint and Tiger Laceration attacks were considered decent. But if they were to be used against someone stronger than himself, they would be slightly lacking in power.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Qing Shui felt that the period of time in which he could madly increase his cultivation level had passed.</p>
 <p>For now, it should be really difficult for him to show anymore improvements in his strength for a long period of time. Even the medicinal Pills wouldn't help. This was because Qing Shui found out a limitation about the medicinal pills. For instance, if a warrior with 200 countries worth of strength was to swallow a medicinal pill which helped boost one’s strength by twenty percent, logically, they would end up gaining a forty countries worth of strength. But this wouldn't really make sense.</p>
 <p>Hence, the King grade, Royal grade and Emperor grade medicinal Pills, all three of them would have this kind of limitation. Furthermore, Qing Shui had also found out that the increase in strength which a King grade medicinal Pill provided couldn't exceed five countries whereas the strength boost provided by a Royal grade would be ten countries at most. As for other things, he too wasn't sure about it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who found out all of these didn't actually find it surprising. In fact, he found it really normal. Despite that, the medicinal pills were still incomparably powerful. Something worth noting was that even though one couldn't take in too much of the same medicinal pills, there were still a lot of variations in the medicinal pills themselves. If one was able to understand the variations of the medicinal pills, they could still make their strength improve at a significant pace. He was aware that this wasn't something too hard to do.</p>
 <p>With his current strength, Qing Shui felt more secure. Even if he was to head to the Central Continent, he felt that he wouldn't be as uncertain as before.</p>
 <p>For the past one year, no one from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord showed up. This made Qing Shui feel really upset. Logically, this kind of things shouldn't happen. Despite that, he was glad that they hadn't came.</p>
 <p>He left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal happily. It was almost noon outside, Qing Shui went out of his room and walked towards the living room.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!l”</p>
 <p>“Daddy’”</p>
 <p>Two babies voices went into Qing Shui’s ears. Two brats with skin as bright as jade opened up their arms as they walked towards Qing Shui. There were cheerful smiles hanging across their small and delicate faces.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly hugged the both of them. Qing Zhun and Qing Yin were now already one year and two months old . They had learnt to speak some simple words and were also able to walk now. It was just that they still needed to be under the supervision of Canghai Mingyue in case they bumped into something.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue stood at a corner as she looked at Qing Shui happily embracing their children. The smile on her face looked really intoxicating. It was a smile which originated from deep within her heart. The happiest smile one could ever see. She was a woman who would easily feel satisfied.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you going out now?” Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>“That's my plan. For now, the Qing Clan has finally walked onto the right path. Qing Bei and the others are also improving very quickly. Nevertheless, Luan Luan is still the most powerful one. She is already at the peak Xiantian grade! It is indeed really important to have talent.” Qing Shui smiled in joy.</p>
 <p>“Your guidance added on with the medicinal pills and some of the body strengthening soup also played a part in it.”</p>
 <p>Speaking of Luan Luan, Qing Shui had a lot of expectations for her. Putting the Seven Heart of Orifices aside, she was already a peak Xiantian Realm warrior despite being younger than fifteen years of age. Furthermore, she had also gotten two peak Martial King grade Demonic Beasts, the Gigantic Ape King and the Violet Wind Electric Sable. The Gigantic Ape King was a giant type Demonic Beast. It was around five meters tall. The Violet Wind Electric Sable on the other hand was the size of a cat. It was around one metre long and its entire body was colored purple and gold. On normal occasions, it was a really gentle Demonic Beast. Once it ran into an enemy however, it's entire body would become as strong as a diamond. It's fatal weapons were its claws and teeth. Each of its attacks contained poisons and it was a speed type Demonic Beast. It specialized in sneak attacks.</p>
 <p>Despite being a peak Xiantian Realm warrior, she already had three peak Martial King grade Demonic Beasts. Even Qing Shui felt a bit jealous looking at her. No wonder people which possessed the Heart of Seven Orifices would most likely end up as beings capable of ruling an extremely large sect by themselves.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui hadn't left was because he was waiting for the arrival of the experts from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. He was scared that if the people of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord came after he left, they would lose their mind and start killing others. But the chances of this happening wasn't so big.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made up his mind to wait for six more months. If the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord still hadn't showed up, he would go to the Central Continent and head to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord himself to end it once and for all.</p>
 <p>The speed at which Elder Ge’s strength increased was very slow. Even after Qing Shui gave him all of his medicinal pills, he still only managed to achieve a strength which was worth less than 70 countries. Overall though, it could still be considered quite a significant increase. After all, he was way too weak before.</p>
 <p>As of now, Qing Shui felt really helpless. It's not like an aristocratic Clan could be formed within a day or two. It was something which was gradually built up generation after generation. Sometimes, it might even take the hard work from a hundred generations to form an aristocratic clan.</p>
 <p>Haste made waste, Qing Shui knew that he was feeling too impatiently. Nevertheless, he still saw a light of hope. It was almost confirmed that Luan Luan would turn out to be a formidable warrior in the future. Furthermore, Yiye Jiange and Wenren Wushuang were also the women in the Portraits of Beauty. Hence, they would definitely be really outstanding.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were also improving very quickly. In comparison, Qing Clan was a bit weaker than them in terms of their talent. Qing Bei and Qing You might be able to achieve something in the future, it's just that Qing Shui felt that he didn't have the time to wait.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui really didn't have a choice, he would leave the Diamond Gigantic Elephant behind. For the past one year, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was also improving quite quickly. On top of this, Qing Shui let it stay in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal all along. After breaking through the Martial Saint grade, it didn't matter if one was a human or a Demonic Beast, there would still be a period of time where they would improve at a steady pace. For the elephant, one year in the outside world was equivalent to two hundred years in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Its strength had increased from the original 120 countries to its current 180 countries. Under the effect of the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection however, it would be worth 360 countries.</p>
 <p>When it used the Diamond Ferocious Attack, it might even achieve a strength which was worth 720 countries!* The Vajra Subdue Demons could lower opponent’s strength by ten percent. Thus, if Fourth grade Martial Saint human warriors were to run into the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, they would only be seeking death.</p>
 <p>Let alone the fact that Diamond Gigantic Elephant still had the extremely powerful area of effect battle skill, the Mighty Elephant Stomp. Thinking about this made Qing Shui feel a lot more relaxed.</p>
 <p>*EN: Yes normally the Diamond Ferocious Attack does 5 times the strength of the Elephant. This editor believes that the author was worried that the Elephant was outshining the MC so he decided to downgrade it to 4 times.</p>
