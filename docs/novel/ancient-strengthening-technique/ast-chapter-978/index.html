 <p><strong>AST 978 - The Guardian Clan! Qing Shui’s Reverie! Reaching Yan City!</strong></p>
 <p>The old man stared at Qing Shui and smiled. After seemingly pondering for a moment, he slowly spoke, “Actually every continent is watched over by a formidable power that defends and protects those continents. The General Manor is an example, however, it is the only one left.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart stirred. No wonder no one had come to dominate the Greencloud Continent. He didn’t reply but instead quietly listened on. He knew that the old man’s next words would be very important.</p>
 <p>“The Central Continent is very strong because of its many guardian forces. The Greencloud Continent only has the General Manor alone right now. This is also the reason why the Greencloud Continent is weak. Every guardian force has their own inheritance. Only under very few circumstances would the inheritance be discontinued. So, the guardian force is also known as the Guardian Clans or Inheritor Clans.”</p>
 <p>“Why are they called Guardian Clans or Inheritor Clans? Could it be that this type of power can only be passed down within the clan?” Qing Shui asked when he thought of the sect.</p>
 <p>“The form of the sects are actually also the form of the clans. There are also many clans within sects. In other words, it is small clans combined together to become a big clan. Or a few big clans joining together. It is in fact still a clan.” The old man’s chuckle made others feel that he was especially benevolent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought so too. He had previously heard from the old man that the General Manor was the only remaining guardian force left in the Greencloud Continent. This meant that there used to be a lot more of them. “Was the Greencloud Continent powerful in the past?” He asked.</p>
 <p>“All the nine continents used to be equal. But the Greencloud Continent gradually declined. Its decline was unstoppable, causing it to eventually become the weakest continent. The four other continents became stronger existence while the remaining four out of these five continents became independent.”</p>
 <p>“Do you know the locations of the Four Continents?” Qing Shui was particularly curious about the direction of the Nine Continents but he had never found the right person to ask about it all this time.</p>
 <p>“There are legends spread by some people, saying that they were up in the sky. In actuality, the other four continents are very vast and are around us. Our five continents are not only surrounded by the four other continents but are also isolated.”</p>
 <p>“Are you saying that one of the other four continents can be reached by passing through the Southern Sea, Giant Beasts Mountains, Sky Penetrating Mountains, Eastern Sea or Polar Icefield?” Qing Shui asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Clever! But it has been many, many years since anyone has passed through them. It has been so long that whether or not anyone had ever actually passed through them has become a legend itself.”</p>
 <p>Among the ancient desolate beasts in the Southern Sea, legend has it that a terrifying sea dragon exists in those waters. It is needless to further discuss the dangers lurking in the gigantic mountains deep in Giant Beasts Mountains. There were desolate beasts, beast tides, poisonous insects and poisonous grasses…...</p>
 <p>There was no need to bring up the Eastern Sea and the Sky Penetrating Mountains. Behind the Northern Sacred Lu Continent was the Polar Icefield. Legends has it that there was a formidable ice beast, some kind of an ice monster, that filled the sky with snow. It was so terrifying that people would rather pass through the Eastern Sea and Southern Sea than try to go through the Polar Icefield.</p>
 <p>Regardless of the location, it would always be through the sky. The sky was actually the scariest existence.</p>
 <p>“Are we able to reach the other four continents from Northern Sacred Lu Continent?” Qing Shui thought before he asked. Chances of him meeting someone who was knowledgeable about this matter was hard to come by, hence Qing Shui had a lot of questions which he wished to ask.</p>
 <p>“Yes! But it is recommended that you possess very strong strength before you attempt to do so. There’s an ancient formation technique. Only those with formidable strength can use it and be able to withstand any invasions during the process.” The man said with certainty.</p>
 <p>“So, what strength is needed to sustain it?” Qing Shui thought for a while before he turned to the old man’s direction.</p>
 <p>“The strength that exceeds 5,000 stars.”</p>
 <p>“Is there any being with the strength of over 5,000 stars in the five continents?” Qing Shui was both not shocked and shocked at the old man’s answer because he had heard that there were no beings with over 5,000 stars in strength in the five continents before.</p>
 <p>“The strength that can be exhibited within these five continents is 5,000 stars at most. But one’s physical strength can exceed 5,000 stars. However, their unleashed destructive power will only be 5,000 stars at most.” The old man looked at Qing Shui, not showing even the slightest sign of impatience as he explained the details to him bit by bit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt at ease after he heard the old man’s answer. As long as he could accumulate his strength so that it reached 5,000 stars, he would be invincible within these five continents. He could then go to the Demon Gate and Lion King's Ridge. He could even visit the other four continents.</p>
 <p>“Old man! Is there no other way to travel to the four other continents?”</p>
 <p>“Passing through Southern Sea, Eastern Sea and so on could also bring you there. You can also pass through the Northern Sacred Lu Continent’s Ancient Great Formation after your strength exceeds 5,000 stars. It is also said that there is another way, which involves the legendary treasures such as the Shrinking Ruler and Heaven Measuring Ruler......”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stupefied when he heard the old man’s words. Those treasures weren’t easy to find and he was thinking of his Nine Continent Boots right now. The Nine Continents Steps could be raised a few more levels. With that, Qing Shui felt that it wasn’t impossible to cross places like the Southern Sea. But of course, it would certainly be difficult to raise those boots by a few levels at the moment. The journey was too far and the route was too dangerous. Most importantly, nobody knew how long this journey would be. Hence, he had never considered this method at all.</p>
 <p>“Old man, can that Ancient Great Formation be used at any time? Will I be able to come back after I have gone over?” Qing Shui thought about it. He wasn’t sure if he could come and go as he wished.</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Great Formation is guarded by a Guardian Clan of the Northern Sacred Lu Continent. It can only be activated once every five years and the activation lasts a day. Each person can only use it once per day. This means that it will require five years to come back again after you have gone over there.” The old man chuckled. Qing Shui couldn’t read the old man’s mood.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a little relieved after hearing the old man’s words. Otherwise, there would definitely be many people coming over from that side. It seemed that people from the other four continents would never come over here for nothing because their strengths would weaken to 5,000 stars if they came over. If one happened to be eyed by their enemy, it was possible that the person would die there.</p>
 <p>“Thank you very much for telling me so much.” Qing Shui said earnestly.</p>
 <p>The old man waved his hand, “These are not secrets. You have formidable strength. Even if I didn’t tell you, you would still find out very soon in the future.”</p>
 <p>“About the Zu Clan.....” The old man looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“It’s up to you. It is fine as long as they stop bothering me.” Qing Shui smiled and said indifferently. Zu Sui was already dead. Zu Yanglong was crippled. Qing Shui had also stopped questioning what had transpired between Zu Clan, Ji Clan and Tie Clan. It was their personal matters and he was not interested.</p>
 <p>“Then this old man shall thank you for your help. How is your family?” The old man asked slowly, as if he was striking up a casual chat.</p>
 <p>“My elder sister will be getting married in a few days. It will be held in Yan Jiang Country. Thus, I came over earlier to prepare.” Qing Shui smiled. This was not a secret either. Qing Shui felt that he would definitely be involved with this General Manor in the future as it was the Guardian Clan of the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>“Oh! Congratulations, little brother! You don’t have to call me old man either. If you don’t mind my arrogance, you can just address me as big brother.” The old man said with a forthright smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated for a second. Those who had the say in the Main Continent were based on strength. Age didn’t mean anything. It was especially based on this kind of relation that achievers were prioritized. He smiled and looked at the old man, “Big brother!”</p>
 <p>“Haha! Good! Come! Let’s go over there and have a drink!”</p>
 <p>The old man and Qing Shui walked over to the stairs and took a seat on the other side. The old man clapped his hands and soon enough, a waitress came over, “Serve us the best wine and dishes you have here.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already found out that the old man’s name was Ji Yunlang. He was the ancestor of the General Manor and was 500 years old this year. He was basically no longer concerned with the affairs of the General Manor. It was absolutely normal for some profligates to appear among the younger generation. But the rules in Ji Clan were very strict. Most of these profligates were basically from the Zu Clan and Tie Clan. This Inheritor Clan was passed on to the Ji Clan. There should only be one of them from each generation. This type of inheritance was similar to the Bloodline Inheritance.</p>
 <p>There were usually one or two Blood Awakening members among the descendants of the Bloodline Inheritance. While inheritor Clans and Bloodline Inheritance were actually pretty similar, one or two outstanding descendants would appear among them. Their strengths would increase at an unusually quick pace and they would definitely be very powerful. Hence, many said that the Guardian Clans all had Bloodline Inheritance in actuality. However, the Bloodline Inheritance of those clans usually involved things like Golden Bloodline and Violet Golden Bloodline.</p>
 <p>Lastly, Ji Yunlang invited Qing Shui to the General Manor. However, Qing Shui declined politely. Ji Yunlang didn’t force him either since he knew that Qing Shui still had other matters to attend to. Thus, he took his leave and left.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hurried on with their journey the very next day. Nobody had mentioned anything about the incident that had taken place the night before. So, Qing Shui casually explained it. Of course, he also mentioned the Guardian Clans as well, causing everyone to sigh in amazement.</p>
 <p>In the past when their cultivation was weak, the people here basically had no chance of coming across all these matters. Even Di Qing, who had grown up in the Di Clan, had never been aware of such information.</p>
 <p>Two days later, Qing Shui and the others arrived at Yan City. When the Guo Clan learned this news they came forward to welcome them from a distance. The Guo Clan was ecstatic to see that so many of them had come. It was evident that the Qing Clan took them very seriously.</p>
 <p>Guo Polu, as well as the clan head, and the old man from Guo Clan greeted everyone happily. Guo Polu saw the woman he had been yearning for day and night. While he was being courteous to his guests, he stole a few glances at Qingqing in between.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui initially planned to stay in an inn located somewhere near the Guo Residence. But the Guo Clan wouldn’t allow them to do so and insisted that they stay in the Guo Residence. He didn’t insist any further since there were many rooms in the Guo Residence and there were not many people in the Guo Clan anyways.</p>
 <p>Back then, the people from Yan City had already known that Guo Clan’s only son was infatuated with the bitter fated young lady of Yan Clan. It was only because Qing Shui appeared to be more powerful later on that he had been able to bring Qingqing away with him. As time went by, everyone knew that the Qing Clan’s strength had skyrocketed. The disparity between Guo Clan and Qing Clan grew and he became even more and more unworthy of her.</p>
 <p>No one had said anything about Qing Clan. After all, Qinqing and Guo Polu weren’t engaged in the first place. Hence, they weren’t considered ungrateful either. But they knew that Guo Polu was infatuated.</p>
 <p>After so many years, the Qing Clan had now become the lord of Heavenly Palace. Almost everyone felt that it was completely hopeless, especially when the Guo Clan went over to propose the marriage a year ago and were instead told to wait for Qing Shui’s return to get an answer.</p>
 <p>At this point, everyone felt that this was just an excuse. Even the Guo Clan thought so too but they weren’t able to change Guo Polu’s mind.</p>
 <p>Guo Polu was very happy at the moment, even though he was actually very nervous before. He wasn’t sure if Qingqing was willing to accept his proposal in the first place. He had only talked very little with Qingqing a year ago when he went to propose. He was very reserved. Many years had passed and she was no longer that delicate lady among the snow. He was happy that she was more cheerful than she used to be. She had been smiling a lot more frequently and also seemed to be very friendly towards him as well. Although he went to propose the marriage, he wasn’t brave enough to ask anything until news of Qing Shui’s return had arrived from the Qing Clan later on. He had a feeling that he might succeed too. Otherwise that ‘excuse’ was indeed a very good excuse.</p>
 <p>When things had finally been decided, only then he dared to gleefully talk to Qingqing. Their conversations flowed very naturally, unlike previously when he was very reserved. The fear of the unknown had scared him.</p>
