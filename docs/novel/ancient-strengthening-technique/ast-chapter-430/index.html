 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 430 &nbsp;&lt;Great Perfection Stage “Art of Pursuing”, Back to Heavenly Palace&gt;</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the problem with power!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it were back to reality, his inferiority complex would instinctively kick in, denying any chances of a woman ever liking him. Without power, he would feel insecure and paranoid, fearing every moment and doubting everyone, as if something would fall onto him anytime.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But it was different in the World of Nine Continents. In this world, martial arts had been advocated as a norm. Conspiracies were also a norm, especially when clans and sects were involved, but they were nothing in front of absolute power.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that God had been treating him well despite carrying a heavy burden on his shoulders since he was young. However, he would still carry these burdens with him no matter how heavy they would become. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he wasn’t determined to bear the burden, he would have thrown them away and lived a carefree life. In this case, misfortunes may actually be a blessing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was able to smell a familiar scent very quickly and discarded all the distracting thoughts from his mind. He believed that one must learn how to survive in the gap of life, learn how to enjoy life despite the suffering and pain, and learn how to forget….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt that one must broaden their horizons so that they could discover how vast the world was and how everything else seemed insignificant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A mountain at the far end would always look smaller from the other end!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The meal the ladies had prepared was sumptuous. The spices, fruits, and seasonings were gathered from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as fresh ingredients for the food. As long as they didn’t add the salt to the ingredients, everything would be fine.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, when Qing Shui saw the dishes on the table, he was shocked by the delightful presentation and the combination of colors from the food. It seemed as though that Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li had been preparing the meal for quite some time. Qing Shui felt like he was still dreaming as he looked at the two women wearing aprons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt at home looking at the aprons they wore. It was a rare sight to see women wearing aprons preparing food in the kitchen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pondered as he looked at them. He had no idea how the three of them had ended up in this kind of strange relationship. It would be difficult to have them both marry him, and it would also be arduous to discuss the marriage to both of them as well. Perhaps Liu-li would start proposing the idea to both of them. In the end, it would remain a possibility no matter how much he thought about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It took about 2 hours to finish the delicious meal. Some of the food had to be reheated because they were immersed in their leisurely conversation about their daily life. The occasional giggles and pleasing laughters filled the atmosphere with warmth and harmony. Huoyun Liu-li was the most talkative one between the two, and she was also the one who laughed the most. It was because of her that the atmosphere became warmer.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As the late night approached, Qing Shui bid farewell to the ladies. He also reminded them on his scheduled journey to Heavenly Palace tomorrow!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he got back to his room, the first thing he did was enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had been a long time since he had reached the 5th layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, Qing Shui already knew it would be difficult to advance to the 6th Layer. The Basic Sword Technique and Taichi Fist were still at the stage of &nbsp;“One with Heaven”, so it would be impossible to reach a breakthrough in such a short amount of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a few rounds of cultivating his Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui proceeded to cultivate his Talisman Drawing once more. It would always be difficult in the beginning, but as he continued to push further, it became easier to grasp the technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like the Godly Force Talisman he had drawn - it felt ineffective at first, but after a few tries, it was less challenging than he had initially thought. However, he still lacked the aptitude to grasp the technique. For now, he could only continue at a steady pace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were some apparent improvements in his Talisman Drawing as well. The current Godly Force Talisman was obviously stronger compared to the ones he had drawn before despite having no success in all of his attempts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed by so quickly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was able to complete 80% of the Godly Force Talisman, and it would take at most two days in real time to finish the talisman drawing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even if the result was a 1st Level Godly Force Talisman, it would more than sufficient to enable Qing Shui to gain about four hundred thousand units of energy. Moreover, it would also require various suitable talismans to cultivate one Heavenly Talisman. Besides gaining additional energy, it had the ability to greatly weaken the opponent as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the Thousand Hammer Technique that had reached the Peak of Obscure Realm showed a slow but steady improvement, there was no sign of it reaching a breakthrough anytime soon. Nevertheless, Qing Shui was already satisfied at its current stage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was already satisfactory to have the technique reach the Obscure Realm. After all, it would require a lot of effort and high amount of luck for both Taichi Fist and Basic Sword Technique to have a breakthrough. After thinking about these factors, Qing Shui felt content at the current stage of his Thousand Hammer Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of the sudden, he remembered about Shield Essence! Qing Shui realized that his Shield Essence had reached the 2nd Level after he consumed the “Greencloud Up-step Pellet”! The imposing force from the shield when combined with the Nature Energy had the ability to pacify the opponents effectively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was unfortunate, however, that Qing Shui never had the chance to use this technique. Despite that, Qing Shui had a feeling that it would show its value when the time was right. As much as he felt hopeful about the Shield Essence, he could not tell how effective it would be. Nonetheless, Shield Essence has already had its breakthrough once.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like he could move mountains when he tried using his Shield Essence. However, he wasn’t able to find the best way to use it in any kind of situation!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued to cultivate his skills at a steady pace. After that, he refined the “Spirit Concentrating Pill” for a bit and then continued on with the cultivation of his Saintly Hands!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui understood the importance of speed in any battle. So he spent most of his time cultivating his Cloudmist Steps until it had reached the Truth Realm. The most challenging techniques to upgrade would always be the ones involving footwork. Cloudmist Steps was one of the techniques that he had spent the majority of his time on to master. However, the upgrade to this technique would always take a significantly longer time to take effect. However, Qing Shui’s speed has been improving consistently at a faster rate compared to normal people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although “Immovable Mountains” had shown some improvements, it didn’t felt like it would reach a breakthrough anytime soon. It was known to be extremely difficult to increase the “aura” of the martial warrior through the cultivation of this type of technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Stronger “aura” would tend to give off an impression of a stronger presence, and subtly allowed control over one’s own imposing manner. It would also mean that the person could be hailed as a master of martial art.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Having an imposing presence could render the weak trembling in fear. Moreover, one would be able to drive their opponents to the brink of death with merely their imposing presence alone. This would be one of the more formidable aspects of possessing such a domineering mien.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Core Qi Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The bouncing technique of the “Black Armored Jumping King” was still as strong as ever. It would be stronger if he coordinated this technique with the Soaring Crane Steps. However, any improvements on this technique would be insignificant once it enters the Realm of Great Succession Stage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There had been a subtle growth in Nature Energy from Qing Shui’s daily cultivation of the Taichi Fist. The slow growth of his Nature Energy was akin to a person dragging tens of thousands of pounds of weights on their shoulders.. Qing Shui was frustrated with the slow rate of growth for Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was be the reason why this type of cumulative technique required time, patience, and perseverance.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Divine Arm Clearing that had reached the Great Perfection Stage had stopped showing further changes and improvement. The Divine Feet Clearing still remained in the realm of Large Success Stage, but it would be able to reach a breakthrough anytime soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And then, he tried to cultivate the Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui is now cultivating his Art of Pursuing after he had spent much of his time on Talisman drawing. He planned to learn the “Binding Talisman” soon and combine it with the Art of Pursuing to reach an abnormally powerful effect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An effect like reducing the opponent’s speed to that of a snail….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Art of Pursuing that had reached the Realm of Great Succession Stage had already shown signs of making a breakthrough. It had been so long since then, and Qing Shui was starting to become impatient. After all, the benefits of the skill would be tremendous once it reaches the Great Perfection Stage. The benefits would be even better than just doubling the power of the user.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gritted his teeth. He decided to put all of the Diamond Qi he had built up recently into the cultivation of Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He built up the energy bit by bit!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clamped his teeth together harshly. After that, he abruptly let out a Tiger’s Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His voice shook the Heavens!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, his blood surged to his head, which indicated he had reached the peak of his energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Shatter!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was at this moment that Qing Shui felt like he had pulled the heaviest Beast Carriage on Earth and reached the highest peak of the mountain. And then for a moment, he slided down the mountain while riding the Beast Coach the maximum speed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Art of Pursuing had broken through!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was drenched in sweat after pushing everything for this moment. He felt extremely happy. Even though the effect of “Art of Pursuing” couldn’t last for a long time, it had the ability to reduce the opponent’s speed and increase their load!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Great Perfect Stage “Art of Pursuing” had the ability to increase the opponent’s load by 20%, as well as reducing their speed by 20%!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt insane just thinking about it. If only he was able to get his hands on the “Binding Talisman” and combine it with the Art of Pursuing….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The next day, the two ladies woke up early as usual. The responsibility of managing the “Earthly Paradise” had been delegated to Mei Yuanxue, since no one would dare to come to “Earthly Paradise” and cause a ruckus after the infamous incident with the Cloudmist Sect from Jian Ye Country. The popularity of this incident had surpassed even the status of the big sects and clans in the Cang Lang Country.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have you ladies packed up?” Qing Shui said as he smiled at them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes. Qing Shui, you are really biased. You only remember about my sister whenever you get your hands on something good.” Huoyun Liu-li smiled gently as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could only force a smile at her remarks. He knew she was talking about the Interspatial Silk Satchel he had given to Canghai Mingyue. He gave it to her because Huoyun Liu-li wasn’t there. Most of the time, the sisters were basically inseparable.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Both of you are always together and inseparable. So it would make no difference if I give it to you or her since the two of you store your things together. Plus, you already went home that day….” Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s fine. I’m only saying that you always give her good stuff, that’s all. Looking at how nervous you are right now, I’m beginning to think that you have done something to her and are are using this to keep her silent.” Huoyun Liu-li took the opportunity to tease Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Enough. Liu-li, stop talking nonsense. I tried giving it to you, but you rejected my offer. Besides, you also keep your things in this satchel. And you’ve stored more things than I have in it.” Canghai Mingyue smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Anyway, let’s go back to Heavenly Palace!” Huoyun Liu-li chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rode the Golden Winged Thunder Condor with the ladies, since Firebird was still inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Moreover, Golden Winged Thunder Condor had just gotten a boost to its power after consuming a Beast Pill and Endurance Pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui headed towards the Heavenly Palace this time with a heavy heart. It wouldn’t be easy to eradicate one of the big sect in the states of the continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui relied mostly on his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and Ancient Strengthening Technique to achieve his goals. Nothing would be impossible as long as he had time in his favor, as well as his alchemy skills. After a visit to Heavenly Palace, he would have to think of a way to gather the materials he needed to refine medicinal pills. He would be able to meet a lot of travelling merchants in the Greencloud Continent if they traveled along the trading routes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Great Revitalizing Pellet, Wind Water Primordial Pellet...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, Basic Sword Technique, Higher-level armor forging, Big Dipper Sword….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And his Talisman drawings, Mighty Elephant Stomp...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of these would eventually become even stronger than before. He also planned to seek the ways of refining a Spirit Concentrating Pill that could increase its effectiveness by sixfold. Qing Shui decided to ask Misty Hall Palace Priestess about the alchemy recipe after he reached the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he remembered about the two pieces of treasure maps in his possession. He had already found the location of one of the treasure maps, but he didn’t have the ability to retrieve the treasure, as it was located at the Flowerfruit Mountain, unfortunately. Qing Shui thought much about the treasure hidden there. What kind of treasure would it be? Would the treasure be able to increase his cultivation substantially after he obtains it?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui reminded himself to refine pills with the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace kept in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal whenever he had time on his hands. After all, some sects were able to stand on top of the World of Nine Continents with these Refining Demons cards alone.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The meal the ladies had prepared was sumptuous. The spices, fruits, and seasonings were gathered from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as fresh ingredients for the food. As long as they didn’t add the salt to the ingredients, everything would be fine.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, when Qing Shui saw the dishes on the table, he was shocked by the delightful presentation and the combination of colors from the food. It seemed as though that Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li had been preparing the meal for quite some time. Qing Shui felt like he was still dreaming as he looked at the two women wearing aprons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt at home looking at the aprons they wore. It was a rare sight to see women wearing aprons preparing food in the kitchen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pondered as he looked at them. He had no idea how the three of them had ended up in this kind of strange relationship. It would be difficult to have them both marry him, and it would also be arduous to discuss the marriage to both of them as well. Perhaps Liu-li would start proposing the idea to both of them. In the end, it would remain a possibility no matter how much he thought about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It took about 2 hours to finish the delicious meal. Some of the food had to be reheated because they were immersed in their leisurely conversation about their daily life. The occasional giggles and pleasing laughters filled the atmosphere with warmth and harmony. Huoyun Liu-li was the most talkative one between the two, and she was also the one who laughed the most. It was because of her that the atmosphere became warmer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As the late night approached, Qing Shui bid farewell to the ladies. He also reminded them on his scheduled journey to Heavenly Palace tomorrow!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he got back to his room, the first thing he did was enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had been a long time since he had reached the 5th layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, Qing Shui already knew it would be difficult to advance to the 6th Layer. The Basic Sword Technique and Taichi Fist were still at the stage of &nbsp;“One with Heaven”, so it would be impossible to reach a breakthrough in such a short amount of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a few rounds of cultivating his Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui proceeded to cultivate his Talisman Drawing once more. It would always be difficult in the beginning, but as he continued to push further, it became easier to grasp the technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like the Godly Force Talisman he had drawn - it felt ineffective at first, but after a few tries, it was less challenging than he had initially thought. However, he still lacked the aptitude to grasp the technique. For now, he could only continue at a steady pace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were some apparent improvements in his Talisman Drawing as well. The current Godly Force Talisman was obviously stronger compared to the ones he had drawn before despite having no success in all of his attempts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time passed by so quickly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was able to complete 80% of the Godly Force Talisman, and it would take at most two days in real time to finish the talisman drawing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even if the result was a 1st Level Godly Force Talisman, it would more than sufficient to enable Qing Shui to gain about four hundred thousand units of energy. Moreover, it would also require various suitable talismans to cultivate one Heavenly Talisman. Besides gaining additional energy, it had the ability to greatly weaken the opponent as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the Thousand Hammer Technique that had reached the Peak of Obscure Realm showed a slow but steady improvement, there was no sign of it reaching a breakthrough anytime soon. Nevertheless, Qing Shui was already satisfied at its current stage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was already satisfactory to have the technique reach the Obscure Realm. After all, it would require a lot of effort and high amount of luck for both Taichi Fist and Basic Sword Technique to have a breakthrough. After thinking about these factors, Qing Shui felt content at the current stage of his Thousand Hammer Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of the sudden, he remembered about Shield Essence! Qing Shui realized that his Shield Essence had reached the 2nd Level after he consumed the “Greencloud Up-step Pellet”! The imposing force from the shield when combined with the Nature Energy had the ability to pacify the opponents effectively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was unfortunate, however, that Qing Shui never had the chance to use this technique. Despite that, Qing Shui had a feeling that it would show its value when the time was right. As much as he felt hopeful about the Shield Essence, he could not tell how effective it would be. Nonetheless, Shield Essence has already had its breakthrough once.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like he could move mountains when he tried using his Shield Essence. However, he wasn’t able to find the best way to use it in any kind of situation!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued to cultivate his skills at a steady pace. After that, he refined the “Spirit Concentrating Pill” for a bit and then continued on with the cultivation of his Saintly Hands!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui understood the importance of speed in any battle. So he spent most of his time cultivating his Cloudmist Steps until it had reached the Truth Realm. The most challenging techniques to upgrade would always be the ones involving footwork. Cloudmist Steps was one of the techniques that he had spent the majority of his time on to master. However, the upgrade to this technique would always take a significantly longer time to take effect. However, Qing Shui’s speed has been improving consistently at a faster rate compared to normal people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although “Immovable Mountains” had shown some improvements, it didn’t felt like it would reach a breakthrough anytime soon. It was known to be extremely difficult to increase the “aura” of the martial warrior through the cultivation of this type of technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Stronger “aura” would tend to give off an impression of a stronger presence, and subtly allowed control over one’s own imposing manner. It would also mean that the person could be hailed as a master of martial art.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Having an imposing presence could render the weak trembling in fear. Moreover, one would be able to drive their opponents to the brink of death with merely their imposing presence alone. This would be one of the more formidable aspects of possessing such a domineering mien.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Core Qi Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The bouncing technique of the “Black Armored Jumping King” was still as strong as ever. It would be stronger if he coordinated this technique with the Soaring Crane Steps. However, any improvements on this technique would be insignificant once it enters the Realm of Great Succession Stage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There had been a subtle growth in Nature Energy from Qing Shui’s daily cultivation of the Taichi Fist. The slow growth of his Nature Energy was akin to a person dragging tens of thousands of pounds of weights on their shoulders.. Qing Shui was frustrated with the slow rate of growth for Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was be the reason why this type of cumulative technique required time, patience, and perseverance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Divine Arm Clearing that had reached the Great Perfection Stage had stopped showing further changes and improvement. The Divine Feet Clearing still remained in the realm of Large Success Stage, but it would be able to reach a breakthrough anytime soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And then, he tried to cultivate the Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui is now cultivating his Art of Pursuing after he had spent much of his time on Talisman drawing. He planned to learn the “Binding Talisman” soon and combine it with the Art of Pursuing to reach an abnormally powerful effect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An effect like reducing the opponent’s speed to that of a snail….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Art of Pursuing that had reached the Realm of Great Succession Stage had already shown signs of making a breakthrough. It had been so long since then, and Qing Shui was starting to become impatient. After all, the benefits of the skill would be tremendous once it reaches the Great Perfection Stage. The benefits would be even better than just doubling the power of the user.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gritted his teeth. He decided to put all of the Diamond Qi he had built up recently into the cultivation of Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He built up the energy bit by bit!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clamped his teeth together harshly. After that, he abruptly let out a Tiger’s Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His voice shook the Heavens!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, his blood surged to his head, which indicated he had reached the peak of his energy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Shatter!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was at this moment that Qing Shui felt like he had pulled the heaviest Beast Carriage on Earth and reached the highest peak of the mountain. And then for a moment, he slided down the mountain while riding the Beast Coach the maximum speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Art of Pursuing had broken through!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was drenched in sweat after pushing everything for this moment. He felt extremely happy. Even though the effect of “Art of Pursuing” couldn’t last for a long time, it had the ability to reduce the opponent’s speed and increase their load!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Great Perfect Stage “Art of Pursuing” had the ability to increase the opponent’s load by 20%, as well as reducing their speed by 20%!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt insane just thinking about it. If only he was able to get his hands on the “Binding Talisman” and combine it with the Art of Pursuing….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The next day, the two ladies woke up early as usual. The responsibility of managing the “Earthly Paradise” had been delegated to Mei Yuanxue, since no one would dare to come to “Earthly Paradise” and cause a ruckus after the infamous incident with the Cloudmist Sect from Jian Ye Country. The popularity of this incident had surpassed even the status of the big sects and clans in the Cang Lang Country.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Have you ladies packed up?” Qing Shui said as he smiled at them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes. Qing Shui, you are really biased. You only remember about my sister whenever you get your hands on something good.” Huoyun Liu-li smiled gently as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could only force a smile at her remarks. He knew she was talking about the Interspatial Silk Satchel he had given to Canghai Mingyue. He gave it to her because Huoyun Liu-li wasn’t there. Most of the time, the sisters were basically inseparable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Both of you are always together and inseparable. So it would make no difference if I give it to you or her since the two of you store your things together. Plus, you already went home that day….” Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s fine. I’m only saying that you always give her good stuff, that’s all. Looking at how nervous you are right now, I’m beginning to think that you have done something to her and are are using this to keep her silent.” Huoyun Liu-li took the opportunity to tease Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Enough. Liu-li, stop talking nonsense. I tried giving it to you, but you rejected my offer. Besides, you also keep your things in this satchel. And you’ve stored more things than I have in it.” Canghai Mingyue smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Anyway, let’s go back to Heavenly Palace!” Huoyun Liu-li chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rode the Golden Winged Thunder Condor with the ladies, since Firebird was still inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Moreover, Golden Winged Thunder Condor had just gotten a boost to its power after consuming a Beast Pill and Endurance Pellet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui headed towards the Heavenly Palace this time with a heavy heart. It wouldn’t be easy to eradicate one of the big sect in the states of the continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui relied mostly on his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and Ancient Strengthening Technique to achieve his goals. Nothing would be impossible as long as he had time in his favor, as well as his alchemy skills. After a visit to Heavenly Palace, he would have to think of a way to gather the materials he needed to refine medicinal pills. He would be able to meet a lot of travelling merchants in the Greencloud Continent if they traveled along the trading routes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Great Revitalizing Pellet, Wind Water Primordial Pellet...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, Basic Sword Technique, Higher-level armor forging, Big Dipper Sword….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And his Talisman drawings, Mighty Elephant Stomp...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of these would eventually become even stronger than before. He also planned to seek the ways of refining a Spirit Concentrating Pill that could increase its effectiveness by sixfold. Qing Shui decided to ask Misty Hall Palace Priestess about the alchemy recipe after he reached the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he remembered about the two pieces of treasure maps in his possession. He had already found the location of one of the treasure maps, but he didn’t have the ability to retrieve the treasure, as it was located at the Flowerfruit Mountain, unfortunately. Qing Shui thought much about the treasure hidden there. What kind of treasure would it be? Would the treasure be able to increase his cultivation substantially after he obtains it?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui reminded himself to refine pills with the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace kept in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal whenever he had time on his hands. After all, some sects were able to stand on top of the World of Nine Continents with these Refining Demons cards alone.</p>
