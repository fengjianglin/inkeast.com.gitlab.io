 <p><strong>Chapter 612 Nine Palace Art、’Nine Continents Steps’，Shrinking A Foot Into An Inch</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui picked up the violet jade!</p>
 <p>It’s impurities started to be cleaned after he started smelting it into liquid. He then added in the tempered Nine Palace Pendant and smelt it with primordial flames.</p>
 <p>Not only did Qing Shui need to smelt, but he would also need to use the violet jade as replacement for materials in the damaged parts of the Nine Palace Pendant. Thank goodness that the prints were not important. Otherwise, with Qing Shui's understanding of the "Nine Palace Art" , it would be hard for him to repair it.</p>
 <p>The violet jade was slowly melted onto the surface of the Nine Palace Pendant, and the damaged portions slowly recovered under Qing Shui's work. The process was extremely slow.</p>
 <p>A soft sound rang out, one which was like friction from placing mismatched parts together. Qing Shui let out a long exhale. He felt very happy looking at the Nine Palace Pendant with a completely new appearance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then took out the small hammer which he specially forged with the flaming metal. This was what he had for forging especially small items or setting precious stones, and this happened to be one of those occasions.</p>
 <p>The small hammer was a fiery red color, its was from the fire element. When Qing Shui had forged this back then, he noticed that it had only one attribute; which was to increase of one's forging ability by ten percent.</p>
 <p>Ten percent was quite a lot, thus Qing Shui was very satisfied. In the area of forging, he already had sufficient strength, he could easily seek materials, and he could just train his mastery since he had time. Thus for now, the only thing he was concerned with was the success rate and the quality of the items which he forged.</p>
 <p>The ten percent increase in forging ability also included strengthening the effect on the item forged and an increase in the success rate by ten percent.</p>
 <p>The small fiery hammer continuously knocked on the Nine Palace Pendant, which was now a purple color . Qing Shui gradually felt the process was getting quite smooth, as if it were just some flames burning up as it wished.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A crisp sound accompanied by the appearance of a dazzling violet gleam caused Qing Shui a need to squint his eyes. He then looked at the successfully tempered Nine Palace Pendant. It was as if he’d woken up from a great dream.</p>
 <p>The dreamy violet color was warm like jade. It’s appearance was not only beautiful, but also carried a hint of elegance. The faint glow and spiritual aura it exuded was extremely strong. However, that glow was gradually absorbed back in, it wouldn’t show up unless he were to channel in Qi of Xiantian.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Pendant: Nine Palace has many hidden mysteries and can pass through all disasters. Violet Jade contains protection from evil spirits. The one who wears it will have his body's physical defence, spirit energy and endurance increase by fifty percent. It has the effect of removing and beautifying poison.</p>
 <p>Defensive battle technique: Nine Palace Art!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Art: Channeling Qi of Xiantian through the specified method by the Nine Palace Art can temporarily increase one's overall defence by twofold and be sustained for an hour. It can be used once a day and cannot be used concurrently with other items of similar effects.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Art circulation method: ...</p>
 <p>Powerful!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at it in a daze, "This is good stuff!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui fondled it lovingly and felt a bit awkward since he, a male, was holding and looking at this beautiful violet Nine Palace Pendant. He put it down and turned his gaze toward the Nine Continent Boots.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continent Boots looked much nicer than the Nine Palace Pendant before it was tempered. It was just that it now looked just like a piece of junk in comparison. However, Qing Shui knew that this Nine Continent Boots wasn’t any inferior to the Nine Palace Pendant. It could only be superior.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui liked these boots even more. His previous one was already done for, it wouldn’t be able to withstand his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, which was at the sixth Heavenly Layer.</p>
 <p>As for the ones he could use, he was only left with the Silk Shirt of the Moon Silkworm, the Violet Gold Divine Shield, and the Big Dipper Sword. Now, there was the Nine Palace Pendant as well. However, Qing Shui hadn’t decided who to give it to. He was now extremely hopeful toward this Nine Continent Boots.</p>
 <p>It was due to there being 'nine continents' in its name.</p>
 <p>Smelting and purifying...Qing Shui didn’t add in that violet jade this time around, but merely purified it. There was some damage to the Nine Palace Pendant previously, thus Qing Shui was forced to add in some of the violet jade.</p>
 <p>Although, that majestic and rustic looking grey was also quite a presentable color. But now, the Nine Continent Boots was slowly turning into the purest silvery grey color, thus Qing Shui wouldn’t be adding in any other colors.</p>
 <p>Smelting furnace!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his Spiritual Sense to sense the transformations of the Nine Continent Boots. It was only after smelting it did Qing Shui realize that its internal structure was extremely complex. Thank goodness that there wasn’t any damage. However, Qing Shui still tried his best to remember the internal structure. He could now barely pass off as being capable in retaining whatever information he sees. Moreover, he was also very bright. Qing Shui decided just remember it for now and only study it in more detail whenever he is free.</p>
 <p>The skeleton to this Nine Continent Boots was made from a special type of metal, one which Qing Shui hasn’t seen before. He felt the exterior was made from something like a beast's hide, tendons or bones, but he wasn’t exactly sure. Qing Shui just knew that it was very valuable from its spiritual aura.</p>
 <p>He spent more time on the Nine Palace Pendant this time around. He was only able to hear that familiar sound of friction after about half a day, he then started to temper it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was getting more and more familiar as he was doing this. Most importantly, it was a kind of peaceful mentality. The red hammer continued to land down creating crisp sounds one after another.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very clear minded this time around and also remembered the number of times he had hammered; It was a total of five-thousand three-hundred and twenty-eight times. Qing Shui knew that this was the highest number of times he had hammered, so he was very excited.</p>
 <p>Looking at the majestic and rustic looking Nine Continent Boots, he felt that its splendid appearance was another type of beauty in itself. It attracted attention just as equally.</p>
 <p>He used his Heavenly Vision Technique on the Nine Continent Boots. Only now was Qing Shui feeling a little excited. Earlier, he was only able to see the names of the Nine Palace Pendant and Nine Continent Boots. Their damage level and effects were unknown.</p>
 <p>However, they were completely restored under Qing Shui's 4-color graded Art of Forging. Qing Shui had performed splendidly and even managed to exceed over five thousand hammers.</p>
 <p>The words that entered into his eyes were 'Nine Continent Boots'. He continued to read on. It was forged from the Astral Fragments and fantastic beasts in the World of the Nine Continents. It had unfathomable powers.</p>
 <p>Increasing speed by a factor of two and reducing energy consumption by half. Those of Martial Emperor level or lower would find it hard to damage it in the least. It also had an additional battle skill called the Nine Continent Steps.</p>
 <p>Nine Continent Steps: Activating the Nine Continent Boots and Nine Continent Steps will make the user travel 100,000 li instantly. Currently at the basic first level and can only be used once daily.</p>
 <p>Prerequisite: Martial Saint level!</p>
 <p>To appear instantaneously 100,000 li away...Qing Shui did a brief calculation on this. The Fire Bird could now travel at about twice the speed of sound, which would only be capable of travelling 116,000 li after a full day’s travel without breaks. Just one use of the Nine Continent Steps would be about a day’s worth of journeying on the Fire Bird. It was a pity that it could only be used once per day.</p>
 <p>This was already quite perverse. The abilities he had already gained was doubling his speed and having his energy depletion cut by half, both of which were considered extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>When martial arts practitioner had displays their full speed, the amount of energy they consume would be two times or even multiple times more than what they would usually use. This was especially the case if they were making an escape or unleashing a sudden outburst. Therefore, having their energy depletion reduced by half was considered quite a heaven defying feat.</p>
 <p>In the World of the Nine Continents, speed was considered to be the hardest to increase, it was even more important than strength. Having speed was the equivalent to having strength. If one had sufficient speed, they would be able to control the battle, and could choose to attack or defend easier.</p>
 <p>Then there was the Nine Continent Steps, which was currently only at the first level. This meant that its level could be increased and its effects would be brought to greater heights...</p>
 <p>Both of these were treasures, but it was a pity that the Nine Palace Pendant conflicted with the Big Dipper Sword. Although they could be equipped concurrently, they couldn’t be used at the same time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put on the Nine Continent Boots. He noticed the boots went quite well with the Silk Shirt of the Moon Silkworm which he was wearing. When he put it on, he could a feel a faint cooling effect enter his feet. It felt very comfortable and light.</p>
 <p>He lifted his foot, but there was no reaction. Qing Shui tried again, but deliberately channeled in a small amount of Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique into it. With just a shake, he’d already moved several steps forward.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. The same thing happened when he tried lifting his foot again. Qing Shui attempted to increase the flow of Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique little by little. Eventually, he was zooming about in the air inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Shrinking a foot into an inch!</p>
 <p>When the flow of the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique reached a certain level, it actually brought about the effect of shrinking a foot into an inch. The Nine Continent Boots was meant to travel across the nine continents, but it was a pity that its speed was still not up to it at the moment.</p>
 <p>However, having the ‘Nine Continent Steps’ still made Qing Shui quite happy. He would be able to travel two days worth in just a single day, saving twice the time. In the future, if Nine Continent Steps could level up, he might be able to cross millions of li each time, allowing him to move across the nine continents easily. However, that was all just talk, Qing Shui didn’t really believe that it was possible. If it were, then wouldn’t it be the same as that legendary Shrinking Ruler?</p>
 <p>He wondered if it was possible to bring along people with him when he used the ‘Nine Continent Steps’. Qing Shui decided to test it out when he had the time.</p>
 <p>Thinking of how it required one to be of the Martial Saint level before it could be used, Qing Shui felt that it was due to the speed one experienced when Nine Continent Steps was used. It would probably be too difficult for those under the Martial Saint to withstand the resistance.</p>
 <p>After coming to a stop, Qing Shui took a break to casually walk around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and have some food. Now, Qing Shui's fish soup would be made using the rainbow trout fish. There was just too much of it. Not only Qing Shui, but even the Thunderous Beast, Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant could eat them as well.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant didn’t eat every day, it would eat about once a week even though it had grown quite big. It would eat about fifty black fish, which were about one foot long, and also fifty rainbow trout fish.</p>
 <p>Although the Crystal Lion was small, it was very flexible in the water. It would take a rest at the sides when it was tired. After all, Qing Shui wouldn’t allow the other beasts, which could possibly eat it, to do so.</p>
 <p>"Hmmm?"</p>
 <p>That small blade of grass which was like a flame had again grown taller since the last time Qing Shui saw it, which quite a while ago. It was now five inches tall, and the red grass looked as if it was full of vitality. He just didn’t know what it was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui collected the things from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal once again. Looking at the items which had accumulated to quite a pile, Qing Shui felt very much at ease. Even if he were to share them all with his friends and family, he would still have enough to use for his alchemy.</p>
 <p>The Golden Medicinal Turtle was now already over 6,500 years old, the 1000-Year Clam was now 2,500 years old, and the Golden Flesh LingZhi had grown from 5,000 years to 6,500 years.</p>
 <p>A thousand plus years meant a great difference in medicinal herbs and spiritual items. Each 1,000 years would be an additional level. The other medicinal herbs in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were also all 1,500 years. Qing Shui was especially excited to see these.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next morning, Qing Shui woke up for his morning practice as usual. Both Qing Shui and Di Chen stayed in an independent courtyard located close to Madam Duanmu and Duanmu Lingshuang.</p>
 <p>There was only Qing Shui and Di Chen in the small and quiet courtyard. This time around, the two of them did not stay on different storeys. The residences here were all elegant looking two-storey pavilions with the main hall on the first level and the sleeping quarters on the second. Therefore, their rooms were right next to each other.</p>
 <p>Flowers started blooming during the warm spring when the new year began. Qing Shui faced the rising morning sun as he practiced his Taichi. He felt that the nature energy in his body was increasing very rapidly.</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy which hadn’t attained any breakthroughs for a while, now started showing some signs of it. Qing Shui focused his thoughts as he gradually practiced each Taichi move.</p>
 <p>Di Chen came out a short while later. When she saw Qing Shui, she smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui decided to stop, since his practice for the day had concluded. He casually greeted her when he recalled that Nine Palace Pendant.</p>
