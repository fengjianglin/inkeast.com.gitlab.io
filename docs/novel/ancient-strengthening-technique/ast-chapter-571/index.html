 <p><strong>Chapter 571 Canghai Mingyue is Pregnant, The Return Journey.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>571 Canghai Mingyue is Pregnant, The Return Journey</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had lived a &nbsp;life of worries, pressures, and a sense of crisis for many years now. He had never truly lived even one day in relaxation. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had already found the turning point he needed. Although this turning point might be too easy for some others, it was simply too difficult for him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was to completely relax..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can I really completely relax?” Qing Shui smiled bitterly as though he was mocking himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His objective in coming to the Central Continent this time was to breakthrough. To relax huh? Something that had etched into his bones and was engraved in his heart for more than twenty years was not something he could easily discard now. He didn’t even know when he could discard it because the people around him still didn’t have the ability to protect themselves and a few of them still needed him to fulfill their wishes...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he needed to completely loosen himself up in order to breakthrough. This was the most proper approach, just like how sharpening your ax would not delay your job of cutting wood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">TL Note: Sharpening your ax would not delay your job of cutting wood is a proverb in chinese saying how good preparation doesn't delay your success. He's saying although relaxing seems like he's not doing anything, it is actually a key to his breakthrough and he may even achieve it before you know it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But this was not something he could control. It was a type of mentality. This thing that had accompanied Qing Shui for more than twenty years was attached to him even more stubbornly than his arms and legs. Arms and legs could be chopped off, but this could only be gotten rid of when one was dead. Or for some, they couldn’t even let go of it when they die, because they had died with a grievance…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old man, what should I do?” in the end, Qing Shui really didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know how he could completely loosen himself up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thus, he could only cry to this old man for help. This old man had a vast knowledge and was extraordinarily experienced.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Right at this moment, the three waitresses arrived at the living room’s entrance with a tray of food. Nian Feng allowed them to come in to place the food on the table.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come, Qing Shui. Let’s eat. Perhaps you will be able to think up of something after dinner,” the old man invited Qing Shui to eat.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Four meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, a soup and a bottle of wine. Although it was not a extravagant meal, the quality of the meal, the atmosphere and the company he was won over everything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Their meal lasted for an hour, and the Tiger Bone Liquor was also finished by the three of them. The old man didn’t mention much about the liquor however, Qing Shui was especially happy because the relationship between them had become a lot closer. Some things didn’t have to be overly expressed as they could be compensated in other forms, in such a way that they could help each other out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, you can try and actually live a life that you want. The life that you yearn for the most. Perhaps that way, you will be able to truly relax,” the old man advised Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart moved. This was actually a good idea. But how could he completely relax if he had other things to worry about in his heart?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You can tell this old man just what is bothering you. I will help you. I know you hail from the Greencloud Continent, but I should still be able to provide you with some help,” the old man spoke out as if he had read what was on Qing Shui’s mind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui briefly told him about the incident with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, the Martial Saint he had killed and the series of other things that had taken place.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, I didn’t expect you to have basically become such a preeminent being in this continent with your young age,” the old man chuckled heartily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Please don’t tease me, Old Man!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to worry about this. While you relax, I will help you look after the Heavenly Palace and the people you care about. Actually, you don’t have to worry too much either. A Martial Saint cultivator will not normally lay a finger on the other cultivators’ clan or the sect they belong to unless they perceive them to be a big threat. Even so, you will be the first one they want to take care of. Otherwise, they will not do something brainless like that.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These few words assured Qing Shui a little. However, it would still take a very long time before he could completely relax, or maybe he would never be able to do so.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at night. He spent a long time pondering about how he could let himself relax. The Old Man had suggested for him to try and live a life that he had always yearned for and missed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But things had changed with the passage of time. Maybe the life he had once yearned for was no longer the life he yearned for now. That would make it hard for him to completely loosen himself up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of a sudden, the image of his mother holding Yuchang and Luan Luan appeared his mind. And then there was also Canghai Mingyue. Maybe she felt very lonely in her heart. Then there was also Wenren Wushuang… was there nothing left for her to rely on?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui seemed to had distantly grasped something, yet he didn’t manage to get a firm grasp. Over these past two months, he kept feeling like something was calling out to him, and it seemed to be coming from the Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The next day!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Old Man. I know what I need to do now. Maybe I will return home in a few days time so that there’s no need to bother you,” Qing Shui said pensively, his tone of voice filled with gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha. Alright. I am sure that you will visit the Central Continent again in the future. We will always welcome you here. This is also your home,” the Old Man laughed heartily.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, just tell me when you are leaving. I am not going to stop you, but let me send you off.” Nian Feng said as he shook Qing Shui’s hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Greencloud Continent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Clan at the Continent's Capital!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, it has almost been four months. Do you think Qing Shui will come back? I wonder if he will be around when the baby is born.” Huoyun Liu-Li stood beside Canghai Mingyue who already had a small baby bump.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue turned her head around and looked at Huoyun Liu-Li with a smile. The smile on her gorgeous face was full of bliss. It was a very contented smile with the sacredness of a mother.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had discovered that she was pregnant with Qing Shui’s child after he had left for less than a month. But Qing Shui had gone to the Central Continent. A trip to and from there would require six months. She realized that he wouldn’t &nbsp;be able to make it back before the child was born.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her pregnancy was the greatest news that had happened to the Qing Clan over this period of time. Qi Yi was extremely happy. Although there was no wedding ceremony, a ceremony wasn’t really necessary for a marriage in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Small clans would usually prefer a grand wedding ceremony because it wasn’t that easy for someone get married compared to large and powerful clans. This was why the ceremonies held by the smaller clans would usually be extremely grand and lively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They would not hesitate to spend all the money they had to declare to the others that they had married on a grand scale and had basically tied the knot with a woman from another clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the contrary, the rich and cultivators preferred freedom because they were relatively powerful figures. It wasn’t because they took marriage lightly but it was more like another approach instead. When it comes to banquets, they would prefer to only invite relatives and good friends.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Banquets could be done at any time. For example, when their child was born, or when their child turned one month old, or during their child’s first birthday. By then the guests would know whose child that was and naturally knew those two were married when they attended the banquet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was why most people didn’t go through any ceremonies when they got married, and the parents of the two clans would only meet when they got engaged!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li had only told Qing Yi now that Canghai Mingyue’s parents had placed their daughter in Qing Shui’s hands back then before they passed away. During these few months when Canghai Mingyue was pregnant, Cang Wuya had paid them a visit and happily told Qing Yi that both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were Qing Shui’s wives and he just hadn’t been able to inform her that time due to distance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Besides, Qing Yi already had a hunch. She knew her son very well and also knew that these were not the only women his son had. But she had remained quiet all this time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya’s appearance had only made things more wonderful. Besides, they didn’t really lose out because Qing Shui had already treated them as his own women since a long time ago.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of people were looking forward to the arrival of this baby. This little baby had connected the hearts of so many people!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang, Huoyun Liu-Li and especially Mingyue Gelou had accompanied Canghai Mingyue most of the time. On top of that, since Mingyue Gelou was already the mother of one, she had been taking great care of Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang had already known that Qing Shui would not solely belong to her a long time ago, so she didn’t really feel too sad. The liveliness was not really a bad thing either.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stayed at the Drunken Immortal Inn for a few days. While he was leaving, the waitress who had been serving him sent him off. Her warm smile made Qing Shui extremely happy and he didn’t know why. This girl could actually be considered a dream in his heart. A dream from a very long time ago in his previous life. Somebody he wanted nothing more than to be his girl when he was still on earth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He knew that she didn’t cultivate, and she had been busy and running around the place every day. Qing Shui handed a Constitution Nurturing Pill and a Tiger Vitality Pill over to her, “Do you believe me? If you do, then eat it.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The girl was a little startled, nevertheless, she accepted the pills and instantly swallowed them. Qing Shui reached out to press a few points on her body and even channeled his qi as a catalyst to help dissipate the medicinal effect in her body faster.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui climbed onto Fire Bird and set off in the direction of the Jade Sea! He didn’t give the girl too many medicine pills because she was only an ordinary girl. He hoped that she could live her ordinary life and he didn’t wish to mess her life up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The pills she took would only caused a slight change in her body constitution and let her possess the strength of 1,000 jin so that she wouldn’t get tired easily from working. It wouldn’t bring too many changes in her life either. He didn’t give her too many pills because if she suddenly changed, she might attract unwanted attention from others who had ill intentions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He once again arrived at the Jade sea to find the few people!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had to capture a Crystal Lion and teach them the Tiger Form next. They had been improving rapidly over the past ten days since he had them, especially Lan Tong. Although her speed wasn’t as fast as Mingyue Gelou, she could reach about half of her speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Five days passed very quickly. Qing Shui was able to get forty Crystal Lions from capturing in the wilds and buying. In addition to the ones he had before, he now had a total of seventy. This was a number that he had never even dared to imagine.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most of the credit went to Lan Tong. If it wasn’t for her, he could only get his hands on twenty of Crystal Lions at most because he didn’t even know where to look for them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Over the past feel days, the feeling of something calling out for him was getting stronger. He knew he should return, or else he wouldn’t have a peace of mind. That feeling was very strange. It didn’t make him feel alarmed or panicky. It just faintly made him feel like he had to answer it…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Teacher, you’re leaving…?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Another three days passed. They already knew that Qing Shui was going to return, so they asked this question sadly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, it’s not like I won’t be returning. I will return to the Central Continent again very soon. By that time, I hope all of you will be Xiantian cultivators, so cultivate well. If you ever run into any big troubles, go to the Drunk Immortal Inn and look for Nian Feng. Tell him that I have sent you to him,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“You can tell this old man just what is bothering you. I will help you. I know you hail from the Greencloud Continent, but I should still be able to provide you with some help,” the old man spoke out as if he had read what was on Qing Shui’s mind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui briefly told him about the incident with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, the Martial Saint he had killed and the series of other things that had taken place.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, I didn’t expect you to have basically become such a preeminent being in this continent with your young age,” the old man chuckled heartily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Please don’t tease me, Old Man!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to worry about this. While you relax, I will help you look after the Heavenly Palace and the people you care about. Actually, you don’t have to worry too much either. A Martial Saint cultivator will not normally lay a finger on the other cultivators’ clan or the sect they belong to unless they perceive them to be a big threat. Even so, you will be the first one they want to take care of. Otherwise, they will not do something brainless like that.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These few words assured Qing Shui a little. However, it would still take a very long time before he could completely relax, or maybe he would never be able to do so.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at night. He spent a long time pondering about how he could let himself relax. The Old Man had suggested for him to try and live a life that he had always yearned for and missed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But things had changed with the passage of time. Maybe the life he had once yearned for was no longer the life he yearned for now. That would make it hard for him to completely loosen himself up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of a sudden, the image of his mother holding Yuchang and Luan Luan appeared his mind. And then there was also Canghai Mingyue. Maybe she felt very lonely in her heart. Then there was also Wenren Wushuang… was there nothing left for her to rely on?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui seemed to had distantly grasped something, yet he didn’t manage to get a firm grasp. Over these past two months, he kept feeling like something was calling out to him, and it seemed to be coming from the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The next day!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Old Man. I know what I need to do now. Maybe I will return home in a few days time so that there’s no need to bother you,” Qing Shui said pensively, his tone of voice filled with gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha. Alright. I am sure that you will visit the Central Continent again in the future. We will always welcome you here. This is also your home,” the Old Man laughed heartily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, just tell me when you are leaving. I am not going to stop you, but let me send you off.” Nian Feng said as he shook Qing Shui’s hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Greencloud Continent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Clan at the Continent's Capital!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, it has almost been four months. Do you think Qing Shui will come back? I wonder if he will be around when the baby is born.” Huoyun Liu-Li stood beside Canghai Mingyue who already had a small baby bump.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue turned her head around and looked at Huoyun Liu-Li with a smile. The smile on her gorgeous face was full of bliss. It was a very contented smile with the sacredness of a mother.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had discovered that she was pregnant with Qing Shui’s child after he had left for less than a month. But Qing Shui had gone to the Central Continent. A trip to and from there would require six months. She realized that he wouldn’t &nbsp;be able to make it back before the child was born.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her pregnancy was the greatest news that had happened to the Qing Clan over this period of time. Qi Yi was extremely happy. Although there was no wedding ceremony, a ceremony wasn’t really necessary for a marriage in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Small clans would usually prefer a grand wedding ceremony because it wasn’t that easy for someone get married compared to large and powerful clans. This was why the ceremonies held by the smaller clans would usually be extremely grand and lively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They would not hesitate to spend all the money they had to declare to the others that they had married on a grand scale and had basically tied the knot with a woman from another clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the contrary, the rich and cultivators preferred freedom because they were relatively powerful figures. It wasn’t because they took marriage lightly but it was more like another approach instead. When it comes to banquets, they would prefer to only invite relatives and good friends.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Banquets could be done at any time. For example, when their child was born, or when their child turned one month old, or during their child’s first birthday. By then the guests would know whose child that was and naturally knew those two were married when they attended the banquet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was why most people didn’t go through any ceremonies when they got married, and the parents of the two clans would only meet when they got engaged!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li had only told Qing Yi now that Canghai Mingyue’s parents had placed their daughter in Qing Shui’s hands back then before they passed away. During these few months when Canghai Mingyue was pregnant, Cang Wuya had paid them a visit and happily told Qing Yi that both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were Qing Shui’s wives and he just hadn’t been able to inform her that time due to distance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Besides, Qing Yi already had a hunch. She knew her son very well and also knew that these were not the only women his son had. But she had remained quiet all this time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya’s appearance had only made things more wonderful. Besides, they didn’t really lose out because Qing Shui had already treated them as his own women since a long time ago.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A lot of people were looking forward to the arrival of this baby. This little baby had connected the hearts of so many people!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang, Huoyun Liu-Li and especially Mingyue Gelou had accompanied Canghai Mingyue most of the time. On top of that, since Mingyue Gelou was already the mother of one, she had been taking great care of Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang had already known that Qing Shui would not solely belong to her a long time ago, so she didn’t really feel too sad. The liveliness was not really a bad thing either.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stayed at the Drunken Immortal Inn for a few days. While he was leaving, the waitress who had been serving him sent him off. Her warm smile made Qing Shui extremely happy and he didn’t know why. This girl could actually be considered a dream in his heart. A dream from a very long time ago in his previous life. Somebody he wanted nothing more than to be his girl when he was still on earth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He knew that she didn’t cultivate, and she had been busy and running around the place every day. Qing Shui handed a Constitution Nurturing Pill and a Tiger Vitality Pill over to her, “Do you believe me? If you do, then eat it.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The girl was a little startled, nevertheless, she accepted the pills and instantly swallowed them. Qing Shui reached out to press a few points on her body and even channeled his qi as a catalyst to help dissipate the medicinal effect in her body faster.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui climbed onto Fire Bird and set off in the direction of the Jade Sea! He didn’t give the girl too many medicine pills because she was only an ordinary girl. He hoped that she could live her ordinary life and he didn’t wish to mess her life up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The pills she took would only caused a slight change in her body constitution and let her possess the strength of 1,000 jin so that she wouldn’t get tired easily from working. It wouldn’t bring too many changes in her life either. He didn’t give her too many pills because if she suddenly changed, she might attract unwanted attention from others who had ill intentions.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He once again arrived at the Jade sea to find the few people!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had to capture a Crystal Lion and teach them the Tiger Form next. They had been improving rapidly over the past ten days since he had them, especially Lan Tong. Although her speed wasn’t as fast as Mingyue Gelou, she could reach about half of her speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Five days passed very quickly. Qing Shui was able to get forty Crystal Lions from capturing in the wilds and buying. In addition to the ones he had before, he now had a total of seventy. This was a number that he had never even dared to imagine.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most of the credit went to Lan Tong. If it wasn’t for her, he could only get his hands on twenty of Crystal Lions at most because he didn’t even know where to look for them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Over the past feel days, the feeling of something calling out for him was getting stronger. He knew he should return, or else he wouldn’t have a peace of mind. That feeling was very strange. It didn’t make him feel alarmed or panicky. It just faintly made him feel like he had to answer it…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Teacher, you’re leaving…?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Another three days passed. They already knew that Qing Shui was going to return, so they asked this question sadly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, it’s not like I won’t be returning. I will return to the Central Continent again very soon. By that time, I hope all of you will be Xiantian cultivators, so cultivate well. If you ever run into any big troubles, go to the Drunk Immortal Inn and look for Nian Feng. Tell him that I have sent you to him,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
