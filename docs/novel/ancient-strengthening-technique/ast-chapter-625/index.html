 <p><strong>AST 625 - The Breakthrough Attained and Benefits Achieved Between Qing Shui and Di Chen</strong></p>
 <p>Everything that followed came as a matter of course, but was also very slow. However, Di Chen did not stop Qing Shui. She allowed Qing Shui to hold onto her, despite still feeling a little nervous.</p>
 <p>Her beautiful figure was a little tensed up and Qing Shui seemed to have sensed that. He smiled and said softly next to her ear, "Don't be nervous, I just want to give you a good hug."</p>
 <p>"You've learned all the bad stuff!" When Di Chen heard Qing Shui's words, she relaxed and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Di Chen's body was very soft, very light and a fragrance that belonged to females which was like the scent of orchids spread to Qing Shui's nose. It was very faint, but very nice.</p>
 <p>Although he hugged her gently, Di Chen was still sitting on Qing Shui's lap. Her soft and tender butt came into contact with Qing Shui's lower half, and Qing Shui shamelessly found that he had a reaction.</p>
 <p>It may be because he had not "tasted flesh" for a long period of time, that his body had reacted and pushed against Di Chen's butt, causing her to feel weak all over and rest her weight on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Di Chen's breath was a little fast. Despite so, she did not say anything. She knew what that thing was, but it was just too sudden, causing her to feel at a loss.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry!" Qing Shui smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>Di Chen had her arms around Qing Shui's neck, moving her butt slightly away from Qing Shui. The feeling of that body part against her body really made her heart beat quicker.</p>
 <p>"Why are you apologizing?" Di Chen turned flush red.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Qing Shui saw an embarrassed Di Chen. It was very different from the majestic and goddess-like feeling she usually had. The her now was like a goddess who had fallen into the mortal world. The flush on her face which was so beautiful that it transcended the mortal world had a fatal attraction to it.</p>
 <p>"I'm having lewd thoughts toward you, and..." Qing Shui said, feeling uneasy.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm trying hard to fall in love with you. You're a man, this is very natural. I like that you're treating me like a woman. The day I fall in love with you, I'll become your woman." Di Chen let go off Qing Shui, smiling at him as she sat next to him.</p>
 <p>"Everything you've done, I understand and know. I'm blessed to be able to receive your interest. I'll definitely let you fall in love with me." Qing Shui held Di Chen's hand.</p>
 <p>"Didn't you say you've something to tell me earlier?" Di Chen gradually calmed down. She did not dare to look at Qing Shui's body since there was still an exaggerated tent down there.</p>
 <p>"You know, your Qihai Acupoint is going to be cleared soon. Actually, I'm hoping to be able to help you clear it. Maybe you'll immediately rise up to the Martial Saint level immediately." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I know. I've forgotten that you're able to clear these acupuncture points which are not fully cleared." Di Chen threw a glance at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not mention the Qihai Acupoint's position since it was a fact known to all cultivators. Therefore, he did not say much and only waited for Di Chen's decision.</p>
 <p>"Is it something which cannot be done over clothes?"</p>
 <p>"Mmm!"</p>
 <p>"Then is it alright if I show the part where the Qihai Acupoint is at?" Di Chen asked, seemingly trying to make a decision.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, that's right." Qing Shui suddenly wondered what he was trying to do...</p>
 <p>"Let me head back to my room to prepare first. You can come in in a while." Di Chen gritted her beautiful white teeth, put on her boots and headed back to her room.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat on the sofa, feeling the layer of dense sweat droplets on his forehead as he tried to calm his heart down, he also tried to let his lower body part calm down.</p>
 <p>He took out the set of Gold Needles which were seven inches long.</p>
 <p>With a flash of primordial flames, he channeled energy into the Gold Needles. This had become Qing Shui's habit.</p>
 <p>He walked up to Di Chen's room and knocked softly.</p>
 <p>"Alright, it's fine now!" Di Chen's voice rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pushed open the door and saw Di Chen sitting on the bed, covered with a think snow-white rug from her waist down. The pink on her face showed that she was feeling very nervous.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and sat on the bed. He looked at Di Chen's wonderful figure which was so perfect. Qing Shui felt that there was no way he could imagine a lady who was more perfect than Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Di Chen had held his Gold Needles since they were not needed at the start. Sitting on the side of the bed, Qing Shui felt a little at a loss. He only reached out his hand toward Di Chen's thin rug after taking a breath.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Di Chen showed no reaction, he gradually pulled it off.</p>
 <p>Di Chen had changed her clothes. Qing Shui had not expected that she had changed into a top which was very short and only reached her belly button. Her bottom was also only from three inch below her belly button.</p>
 <p>The skin that was exposed out was beautiful like jade, and her flat stomach had no flab on it at all. Her snow-white and tender skin was so dazzling and her perfect figure was revealed to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>That beautiful and exquisite belly button of hers was especially beautiful!</p>
 <p>"Do I look good?" Di Chen blushed and asked, making Qing Shui regaining his senses as if he had just woken up abruptly from a dream. He did not know that Di Chen was also very nervous when she posed this question.</p>
 <p>"You know, you're too beautiful." This time around, Qing Shui acted more natural.</p>
 <p>"Then let's start!"</p>
 <p>"Mmm!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gradually reached out his hand!</p>
 <p>Saintly Hands!</p>
 <p>Instantly, one of Qing Shui's hand sparkled, exuding a thick spiritual energy before gradually landing on the exposed snow-white skin under her belly button.</p>
 <p>The tender feeling he felt in that instant cause Qing Shui's heart to skip a beat.</p>
 <p>A surge of spiritual energy flowed into Di Chen's body from his hand, and then moved around in her meridian channels. This was how powerful Qing Shui's Saintly Hands were. Through the Saintly Hands, the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique would be transformed into a kind of spirit energy without any attributes. It could be absorbed with anyone of any elemental attributes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now trying to strengthen Di Chen's meridian channels. After one cycle, Qing Shui discovered that Di Chen's meridian channels were quite strong. Moreover, there were many acupuncture points which had been cleared. It could be said that Di Chen's foundations were especially sturdy.</p>
 <p>Di Chen lay against the thick bolster as she looked at Qing Shui's hand on her abdomen. A faint heat entered her body, giving her a slightly itchy feeling.</p>
 <p>This was the first time they had contact in real life. Although the Dream Among The Sea of Flowers felt real, it was after all, an exchange of their consciousness. However, right now, they were having direct contact.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not stupid. For a lady like Di Chen to be making such a decision, it already explained a lot. Therefore Qing Shui was very sincere, very devoted, and very attached...</p>
 <p>He took out the Gold Needles he had prepared!</p>
 <p>He inserted on into the "Zhangmen Acupoint" in a flash. The Zhangmen Acupoint was also a major acupuncture point in the human body.</p>
 <p>The Gold Needles trembled slightly. If he were to take a closer look, he would notice that it was spinning slightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again inserted another Gold Needle!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Using the Gold Needle to strengthen the body and foundation!</p>
 <p>After inserting eight Gold Needles, Qing Shui held onto the final ninth Gold Needle, occasionally gently touching the other eight needles, channeling a pure divine energy.</p>
 <p>The Qihai Acupoint could be said to be in the Dantian. Therefore clearing it could result in the Dantian's capacity to be greatly enlarged. The moment it was cleared, one would also be able to receive the purest energies from the heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's forehead was once again covered in a dense layer of sweat droplets, the final Gold Needle landed right on the Qihai Acupoint.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>A faint sound rang out!</p>
 <p>In that instant, an immense aura came out from Di Chen's body!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>A slight crisp sound rang out. Qing Shui heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>Di Chen's eyes were closed and her beautiful body was laid out right in front of Qing Shui. However, Qing Shui was in no mood to admire it, but just fully focused on the changes in Di Chen's body.</p>
 <p>All the pure energies from the heaven and earth gushed endlessly into Di Chen's body and then entered her Dantian, circulating in her meridian channels, moving faster and faster.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Di Chen opened her eyes and a wore a slightly pained expression. Qing Shui panicked. Could it be that something had gone wrong with their attempt to clear the Qihai Acupoint? Or was it because there had been too much pure energy from the heaven and earth gushing into her?</p>
 <p>Her divinely beautiful face was now pale white and she was covered in a dense layer of perspiration all over. In this moment, Qing Shui could not care about anything else. He felt a heartache and reached out his two hands to grab onto Di Chen's two hands tightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui even felt that Di Chen's breath was gradually weakening. The pure energy gushing into her body was too overwhelming and her body could not take it. Qing Shui had not expected it to be so strong and fell into panic. He knew that he must get Di Chen to make it through this phase.</p>
 <p>"Chen`er, hang on! You must hang on! You still need to go to Di Clan! I promise you, after you've made it through this, we'll head to Di Clan immediately, alright? You must hang on! Don't you like kids? Don't you want a child of your own…?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed onto Di Chen's hands and said in a panic.</p>
 <p>Di Chen opened her eyes and looked at Qing Shui, her eyes filled with warm smiles. She looked very happy, very satisfied. However, her breathing was still getting weaker and weaker.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not expected such a thing to happen when the Qihai Acupoint was cleared. Her internal organs were not able to withstand the sudden increase in power.</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui was planning to remove Di Chen's clothes and attempt to help her by using Five Element Acupuncture, the Unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique in his body suddenly started to circulate by itself.</p>
 <p>It then entered Di Chen's body very naturally!</p>
 <p>In that instant, both Qing Shui and Di Chen were shocked. A wonderful feeling broke out between the two of them. It was a feeling like a fish in water, as if a person who was going to die of suffocation had suddenly breathed in fresh air. It was also like the feeling when Qing Shui was going through Duo Cultivation with other women.</p>
 <p>So the effect of Duo Cultivation could also be achieved like this...</p>
 <p>Duo Cultivation was also cultivating a Duo Cultivation technique back in the Misty Hall. Her Duo Cultivation technique could be practiced alone and was not those pure Duo Cultivation techniques which must be performed between two people.</p>
 <p>Gradually, Qing Shui discovered that Di Chen's aura was slowing recovering. Her body's strength was obviously increasing, and the aura in her body was also growing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Di Chen was going to break through to the Martial Saint level.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a silvery-white colored light circle appeared from Di Chen's body. Concurrently, that strong force from the Unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique once again returned to Qing Shui, causing Qing Shui to have the same silver-white colored light circle emitted from his body.</p>
 <p>"To think that this works too..." Qing Shui was in a daze as he sensed that his powers had been increased by 10%...</p>
 <p>The strength of Qing Shui's body had now reached 205 countries!</p>
 <p>Do not look down on this 10% increment. Under the effect of the Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection and supporting martial techniques, his powers had increased by 19 countries. Adding on all the effects of all other things, including martial techniques, equipment, Heavenly Talismans, the increase was exactly at 100 countries...</p>
