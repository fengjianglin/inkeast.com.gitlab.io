 <p><strong>AST 696 - Luan Silver Battle Dress, the woman on the Portraits of Beauty was her!</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared at the Luan Silver Battle Dress . It's considered a false Divine Artifact, but it has too many limitations.</p>
 <p>It was already considered a Divine artifact to low grade Martial Saint Warriors whereas to Peak Grade Ten Martial Saints, it’s something they’d find useless yet hard to part with. Nevertheless, the Luan Silver Battle Dress was still quite powerful because the function of it was to ignore defense which was still considerably insane. Unfortunately, it could only be used when it was in the complete set. Other than that, there was still the ability to block three offensive attacks.</p>
 <p>Even though it didn't specify up to how many countries worth of strength it could block, Qing Shui had a feeling that it wouldn't be weak. It should more or less be able to block attacks from early stage Peak Martial Saints which in other words, meant around thirty thousand countries worth of strength. There had to be a limit to the strength of the attacks it could block because this was the rule set up across the continent.</p>
 <p>In addition to that, one of the worst limits was that it could only be used for fifteen minutes every day.</p>
 <p>Also, Peak Martial Saint Warriors weren’t allowed to use it. But as Qing Shui thought about it, he had yet to run into anyone with strength at Peak Martial Saint. If a peak-tier Grade Ten Martial Saint was to wear the Luan Silver Battle Dress, he would definitely have more than enough power to kill an early stage Peak-Stage Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued scrolling down and found the method to operate Luan’s Strength.</p>
 <p>He immediately passed it over to Hai Dongqing. Considering that she happened to have the strength of a Grade One Martial Saint, this thing would be able to help her take a huge leap in terms of her strength.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, she hadn't really seen the words on the beast parchment paper. When Qing Shui passed it to her, she put down the beautiful clothes and started reading it.</p>
 <p>As she looked down, she became more and more surprised. She looked at Qing Shui in shock like she was doubting that this was real: “are these all real?”</p>
 <p>“You can first learn the Luan’s Strength then give it a try after wearing it. You would know if it is true, by then.” Qing Shui smiled at Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>“You’re going to let me try it?” Hai Dongqing said gently while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Of course it's gonna be you. Only you could wear beautiful garments like this, or would you like me to try instead?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui and started laughing too. This made Qing Shui suspect that she must be laughing because she was thinking of how he looked when he wore the Luan Silver Battle Dress.</p>
 <p>“You should learn the Luan’s Strength first. I'm going to take a look at this drawing in the meantime.” Qing Shui quickly tried to change the topic.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let me have a look at it later.” Hai Dongqing said casually before looking at the training method. She was very quickly engrossed in it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, slowly opened up the sixth Portrait of Beauty. The moment Qing Shui opened it, he was stunned and turned into stone for a moment.</p>
 <p>This was too much of a coincidence…...</p>
 <p>The woman in the picture looked extremely noble and elegant. Her hair was tied up neatly and she had a mature and beautiful face with a pair of gorgeous eyes. Her skin was smooth and pale, sparkling like jade while her neck was long and thin. Her slender body looked fine and delicate. The way it was curved made people feel as if they were in a dream. Her bulging front and butt formed the most perfect curves, making her look even more alluring. The snow white flowing cloud skirt that she was wearing caused her to be at the borderline between being a goddess and a human.</p>
 <p>The sixth Portrait of Beauty!</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing!</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing being in the Portraits of Beauty wasn’t really the thing that surprised Qing Shui. After all, she was still arguably a woman who could topple countries. The elegance and charm that she gave off could leave people captivated. Even though it’s different than Di Chen, Di Qing or Canghai Mingyue, it was still really intoxicating.</p>
 <p>What truly surprised Qing Shui was of all the times he got the Portrait of Beauty, the one he got this time had to be Hai Dongqing, right at the time when he went out with her. This kind of coincidence was too freakish and weird.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Hai Dongqing raised her head and happened to see Qing Shui’s stunned look. She approached Qing Shui in confusion and as soon as she saw the picture, she was also stunned. Every single person who had seen her before would definitely recognize the person in the picture to be her. But she knew that she had never had her picture drawn before.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui could feel Hai Dongqing approaching him. The two were really close to each other. Even their shoulders were touching. As Qing Shui noticed that, he slowly rolled the picture back up.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to put away the drawing first.” Qing Shui shamelessly put away the drawing into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, along with the box.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui. Her face looked a bit red but despite that, she didn’t really say anything. Instead, she took up the entire set of the Luan Silver Battle Dress and proceeded to tell Qing Shui: “I’m going to change my clothes.”</p>
 <p>After she finished speaking, she went towards the main hall, the place where she slept yesterday.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that she was trying to remind him to not peep on her. It’s just that the tone she used when she spoke drove him wild with lots of fanciful thoughts.</p>
 <p>The most important thing was that she seemed to really trust him. Was he really so non-threatening to her? He started over-thinking a lot of things. The more he thought about it, the harder he found being a good man was.</p>
 <p>When Hai Dongqing, who was wearing the Luan Silver Battle Dress, silver earrings, necklaces, girdle and boots, and a three feet long Luan Silver Sword turned around, Qing Shui was immediately stunned.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Hai Dongqing was like a goddess who descended from the sky. Her graceful and noble look reached its peak. Each and every one of her actions looked elegant to the extreme. Not only this but there was even a kind of magnanimity and heroic feeling to it. It felt really intimidating or rather, it made people standing in front of her felt a sense of inferiority.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing felt a bit uneasy facing Qing Shui’s stare and lowered her head down. Despite this, she felt a faint happiness deep in her heart. At the same time, she also felt a bit worried because it would be really easy if a man like him had wanted to do something cheap to her. But as she thought about his personality, she felt that she might have overthought it.</p>
 <p>“No one other than you would look at me like that.” Hai Dongqing interrupted Qing Shui grudgingly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who came back to his senses, blushed. Prior to this, he was truly attracted by the elegant and mature woman in front of him. Qing Shui was infatuated with her elegance and charm. A beautiful woman is just like a cup of wine, the more time you spend with it, the more flavor you will find in it.</p>
 <p>Looking at the embarrassed Qing Shui, Hai Dongqing smiled. She never thought that this man would ever blush. In fact, he looked quite good with his face red.</p>
 <p>“You look really good!” Qing Shui said awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing smiled and suggested Qing Shui walk out together with her. After that she turned around and walked out. Even though this man had complimented her twice, there was a different feeling for each of them. Despite the way he complimented her being really straightforward, she really enjoyed it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed Hai Dongqing and they walked out together. He looked at the extreme beauty in front of him with the silvery cloth on. In between her steps, there was an indescribable charm and attractiveness to it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood opposite Hai Dongqing, around ten meters apart while Hai Dongqing attempted to operate the Luan’s Strength. After only a few breaths time, a faint silvery light emerged from Hai Dongqing’s &nbsp;body. It seemed to be somehow attached to the Luan Silver Battle Dress she was wearing.</p>
 <p>He could feel Hai Dongqing’s strength wildly increasing. Doubled, it actually doubled!. However, Qing Shui also felt an unknown force increasing within her. Considering that the boost in her speed was really terrifying, he suspected the unknown force to be somehow related to her speed.</p>
 <p>“You should first try to get yourself adapted to your speed.” Qing Shui was aware that human’s body and mind might not be able to catch up to a sudden and significant speed increase in one go.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing moved. Her speed was so fast that even Qing Shui couldn't catch up with his eyes. While facing this kind of speed, he would only be able to stand up against it if he ate the Gale Pellet.</p>
 <p>She could already use it so smoothly despite this being her first time using it. This surprised Qing Shui greatly. As he attempted to thoroughly sense her, he realized that not only had her strength doubled, there was even a mysterious strength filling up her body. Not only did it make her feel intimidating and mysterious, it even aided her in &nbsp;adapting to the speed and strength increases that she temporarily had.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately took in a Gale Pellet and suggested Hai Dongqing attack him.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing hesitated for a moment and then immediately charged towards Qing Shui at incredible speed. The Luan Silver Sword formed a silvery sword aura through the air as it was sliced towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A clear metal noise rang. Speed is a kind of strength. This attack definitely wasn't something which she could achieve just by doubling strength alone.</p>
 <p>Ding…...</p>
 <p>After that, Hai Dongqing ran around the area with a kind of footstep which was a feast to the eye and attempted to slice Qing Shui apart with the Luan’s Silver Sword in her hand. She looked elegant and agile while doing it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who was holding the Big Dipper Sword and Violet Gold Divine Shield also felt a kind of pressure. After all, the speed at which it happened was too fast. Even though Qing Shui swallowed the Gale Pellet, he still felt that he was a bit slower than her.</p>
 <p>Combination Sword Technique!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui found an opportunity and bested Hai Dongqing with brute force. Without further hesitation, he even swiftly clashed the Violet Gold Divine Shield against her. All along, it had been his intention to do so.</p>
 <p>However, upon collision, Qing Shui held back more than half of his strength.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing immediately blocked it with her arm. In the instant her arm and Qing Shui’s Violet Gold Divine Shield came into contact, a fierce silvery light flashed and immediately pushed away Qing Shui’s Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two came to a stop.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui angrily: “wereare you planning to kill me?”</p>
 <p>“Of course not. As if I could bare to lay my hand on you.” Qing Shui said awkwardly. He was just trying to experiment with the ability to resist three attacks. If it failed, Qing Shui would still stop.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words caused Hai Dongqing to unnaturally avoid Qing Shui’s eyes and shot a glare at him before walking into the main hall. However, she came out very quickly with the Luan Silver Battle Dress neatly folded in her hands.</p>
 <p>She walked up to Qing Shui and passed it back to him.</p>
 <p>“Why are you giving it to me?” Qing Shui asked Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>“This is yours, of course I have to give it back to you.” Hai Dongqing smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it for a while. The two were actually just normal friends. For something so valuable, naturally, the person who first got it would be the one to possess it. Hence, it wasn't unusual for her to give it back to him.</p>
 <p>Don't you like the Luan Silver Battle Dress Set? Qing Shui asked her. He didn't extend out his hands to take the dress back.</p>
 <p>“I like it, but it's yours.”</p>
 <p>“Then I'll give it to you. Just treat it as your reward for bringing me here this time, how's that?” To be honest, Qing Shui really didn't want to give it to her, after all, it's a Divine Artifact Grade Weapon. It would be much better if he could give it to his women, for example, Di Chen.</p>
 <p>It was just that as Qing Shui thought about the Portraits of Beauty, the beauty in the portrait was wearing the Luan Silver Battle Dress, Qing Shui felt that it was specially made for Hai Dongqing. Hence, he took away the portrait and made up his mind to give the Luan Silver Battle Dress to her.</p>
 <p>“No, my reward shouldn't worth this much?” Hai Dongqing smiled and shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Then why don't you wear it for now and give it back to me once we’re out? At least it can help you raise your strength.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
