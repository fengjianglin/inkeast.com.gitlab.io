  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>542 Beheading The Unlucky Martial Saint </strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nine-Winged…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nine-Winged Golden Cicada!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was dumbfounded. He suddenly had the sudden impulse to laugh wildly towards the heavens!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although he had obtained the Wind Water Primordial Pellet Alchemy Recipe a long time ago, he had never been able to concoct it because he lacked this Nine-Winged Golden Cicada. He was almost able to concoct the Everlasting Pellet now...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui placed the comparatively precious Cicada that he found in this private room into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He walked around the private room but none of the items that remained piqued his interest so he left. He saw the two old men from earlier as soon as he came out of the room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They stood there, looking a little panic-stricken!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui raised his eyebrows because he already heard the chaotic noises coming from above them. “What’s going on outside?” he asked one of the old men.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A Martial Saint has come, Patriarch……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately bolted upstairs as soon as the old man finished his sentence. At the same time, he tried to guess who it could be. “The Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Four and half years had passed since the incident with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. It had also been more than half a year since the Sword Tower and the Demonic Beast Sect were eliminated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had been worried that a Martial Saint would come for him, but he didn’t expect it to really happen. Qing Shui couldn’t help but be worried at the mere thought of the terrifying strength possessed by a Martial Saint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t think of any other Martial Saints who would look for trouble with him other than the one from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He raised his speed to its peak and expanded his spiritual sense. The moment he came out from the basement, he could felt a burning aura that scorched the heavens in the public square.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was certain that this was the strength possessed by a Martial Saint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without thinking, Qing Shui bolted towards the hill at his top speed. That hill had become his own place, although he rarely stayed there.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stopped thinking too much. He needed to hurry with his fastest speed and activate the Violet Divine Crystal…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he was worried yet excited at the same time. He barged into the familiar room and quickly grabbed the Violet Divine Crystal to channel the Qi of Ancient the Strengthening Technique into it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In an instant, the entire Violet Divine Crystal emitted a dazzling violet light. At the same time, a boundless energy spread in every direction.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to put on his latest armor. With the Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Big Dipper Sword in his hands, he marched towards the public square.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come out, Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“AHHHHH!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A heaven shaking voice rang out clearly, accompanied by a blood-curdling scream!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you don’t come out, I will kill a person with my every yell!” The voice thundered, clearly audible to Qing Shui who was hurrying towards the public square.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tell me, who is the person that Qing Shui cared the most?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“AHHHHHH!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Another blood-curdling scream was heard! It was obvious that the person was killed for not answering the question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You tell me!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There’s no need for them to tell. I am the one!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A sudden wave of brute energy burst forth the moment from Qing Shui when he heard Canghai Mingyue’s voice. He let out an ear-splitting tiger roar towards the heavens.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha. Brat, even if you come out, I will still kill her and let you have a taste of a heartache before you die!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A hint of indescribable derangement could be heard in that sharp and clear voice!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You should check if your current strength is still at the Martial Saint level. Don’t die without even knowing how you died!” Qing Shui quickly spilled out the effects of the ‘Violet Divine Crystal’ in order to attract his opponent’s attention and stall for time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The public square was already crowded!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He wasn’t certain if this ‘Violet Divine Crystal’ could really indeed weaken a Martial Saint to a peak Martial King. If it could, then Qing Shui didn’t have to worry much as opponents below the Martial Saint level posed no threat to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha, who are you trying to kid? The wave of energy from earlier only lowered my strength by 20 %. Do you think that is enough for you to fight me evenly?” The clear voice was filled with disdain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His Cloudmist Steps was no longer the same as it was in the past. Qing Shui was able to make it there in time and saw the Martial Saint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was an old person!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Not that old either, but he gave off the feeling that he had lived for a long time. His silver hair danced in the wind, his figure slender and well-proportioned. His eyes were cold like steel and his snow-white eyebrows reached his shoulders.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stood amongst the bodies of a few ordinary disciples who had fallen. Fresh blood stained the ground beneath his feet crimson.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Patriarch!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Patriarch!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……....</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled towards Canghai Mingyue who had a worried expression on her face. His smile instantly made her feel relieved!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was thinking at the same time. Why had the ‘Violet Divine Crystal’ only weakened the strength of his opponent by 20 %? This was not a funny joke.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who are you? Why are you making a ruckus in my Heavenly Palace?” Qing Shui was pissed! This Martial Saint had not only used unscrupulous methods to make him show himself, he had even resorted to massacring the weak.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahahaha, who am I? You killed my younger brother. Tell me, is it wrong of me to kill you today?” The old man turned his electrifying gaze towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I killed your younger brother?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. Not only that, you have also eradicated his sect. Young man, do you know that you shouldn’t be so ruthless in doing some things?” The old man looked at Qing Shui, not even bothering to conceal the hatred in his eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, that’s right. I hail from the White Cloud Pavilion of the Central Continent. The Demonic Beast Sect was my younger brother’s sect. You need to bear the consequences of your actions,” the old man slowly took a step forward while glaring at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This single step carried a suppressive aura of a lofty mountain that could hide the heavens and cover the earth. The feeling of a heavy gigantic stone that crushed down on one’s chest was enough to make a person breathless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the Violet Divine Crystal could only suppress about 20 % of the old man’s deep and immeasurable strength, Qing Shui still had to fight on. This was for the sake of himself, the ladies, and also the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Nature Energy was able to dissolve the pressuring aura that came from the Martial Saint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Along with the Divine Shield Talisman and the Godly Force Talisman, he was also under the effects of the Big Dipper Sword and the Violet Gold Divine Shield!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s strength had reached a total of thirty two countries while his defense had reached more than twenty countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blue Lotus Art!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three lotus flowers immediately surrounded him as protection!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With this, Qing Shui’s defense had reached a terrifying level of approximately forty five countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just when an unfathomable expression appeared on the Martial Saint’s face, Qing Shui summoned his Diamond Gigantic Elephant. At the same time, he locked on to the Martial Saint with his Emperor’s Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On top of the reduction of 20 % by the Violet Divine Crystal, his strength was reduced by a further 20 %!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the other hand, Qing Shui’s strength was once again raised immensely under the State of One with Elephant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although his offensive power was slightly lacking, he was still able to achieve the strength of forty countries under the State of One with Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His defense, however, had achieved an absurd amount of more than fifty countries……!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Godly Armor Shield!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Violet Gold Divine Shield in Qing Shui’s hands glowed with a faint violet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An all-out shield attack under the state of One with Elephant struck towards the old man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thump!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was one heavy strike. The qi force that radiated from the attack smashed the hard rocks on the ground to pieces. The ground within the radius of 100 meters was also in a disastrous state, and tremors could be felt.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui retreated three steps and jumped off the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. The old man on the other hand, only swayed slightly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although he didn’t take any steps back, Qing Shui saw a glimmer of hope the moment he swayed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The person standing against him was a Martial Saint cultivator. For him to be able to fight a Martial Saint cultivator, that single attack that forced him to sway was enough for him to live proudly on the Greencloud Continent for the remaining half of his lifetime.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man’s electrifying gaze locked onto Qing Shui, his eyes were filled with disbelief. With the longsword in his hand, he performed a straight thrust. His silhouette flashed by.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The longsword pierced towards Qing Shui like a dragon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel that the power in this sword attack seemed to have once again increased a little!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He clenched his teeth to endure the force of the attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man repelled Qing Shui with a single sword attack. Sidestepping once, he performed another jumping pierce towards him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Piercing Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui exerted his strength cleverly, but he was once again sent flying from another sword attack. He threw out a Binding Talisman in midair!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man however, continued to relentlessly pursue Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui secretly lamented. This Martial Saint was indeed powerful. His strength had been reduced by 40 % while his speed had been reduced by 20 % and another further 30 % by the Binding Talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yet, even with half of his speed reduced the old man still appeared to be slightly faster than Qing Shui, despite Qing Shui’s current speed being decent. With his boots and a few pieces of armor, he had an additional 70% to his speed …….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He also had another 50% additional speed from the Grade Five Dark Jewel Necklace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bam bam boom…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Relying on his powerful body, Qing Shui clashed against the old man relentlessly. He continuously dished out the Art of Pursuing, Binding Talismans and Armor Break Talismans at the old man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most of the people within a radius of 100 meters had already evacuated a long time ago. The rocky surface beneath their feet was already heavily damaged and there were many deep ditches…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blood leaked out of the corner of Qing Shui’s mouth. He had been waiting for his chance to use the Flickering Light Passing Shadow and Critical Damage. If he couldn’t succeed even once with those, then it would basically be impossible for him to win this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As long as his opponent couldn’t cripple him with a single technique, he had the confidence to defeat him. Even if they had a big gap between them, Qing Shui still had the Great Revitalizing Pellet, although he tried not to rely on it if possible. One of the reasons was that the Great Revitalizing Pellet was too precious, secondly, Qing Shui wanted to improve himself through actual battles.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ferocious Diamond Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even under its full power of thirty two countries, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, when faced with a Martial Saint,was still unable to break the opponent’s defense.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It stopped fighting back!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui appeared increasingly pathetic while the old man’s attack grew increasingly aggressive!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This chain of attacks allowed him to sense the old man’s attack and defense. At the same time, his heart burned with a fighting spirit!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man’s speed suddenly increased as he bolted towards him in a half zig-zag pattern. He swept the longsword in his hand horizontally, leaving a trail of black shadows!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was almost as if a faint thunder rumbled in the air. The stifling atmosphere made him feel nauseous!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was panic-stricken!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that very moment, the longsword made contact with the Violet Gold Divine Shield...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Flickering Light Passing Shadow!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw a moment of relaxation appear on the old man’s fierce-looking face, he moved. His speed was raised by onefold by Flickering Light Passing Shadow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With his crafty footwork, he slid behind the old man. The Big Dipper Sword quickly slashed down on the old man’s back, so fast that it left a trail of afterimages.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Critical Damage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As luck would have it, Qing Shui discovered that the old man’s defense, after his strength had been reduced, was only slightly higher than Qing Shui’s attack power.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This sword attack completely neglected half of his defense!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was also very fortunate for Qing Shui that this sword attack was enough to claim the life of this unlucky Martial Saint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A mouthful of blood coughed out of the old man looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. His eyes were filled with so much disbelief that they didn’t shut even after his final breath…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The crowd immediately went still!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Patriarch won!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Patriarch defeated the Martial Saint!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Patriarch is so formidable!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Like that, every disciple of the Heavenly Palace in the public square became hot-blooded. They worshiped martial arts. Watching this kind of rare battle scene made them feel hot-blooded and amazed!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">He walked around the private room but none of the items that remained piqued his interest so he left. He saw the two old men from earlier as soon as he came out of the room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They stood there, looking a little panic-stricken!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui raised his eyebrows because he already heard the chaotic noises coming from above them. “What’s going on outside?” he asked one of the old men.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A Martial Saint has come, Patriarch……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately bolted upstairs as soon as the old man finished his sentence. At the same time, he tried to guess who it could be. “The Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Four and half years had passed since the incident with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. It had also been more than half a year since the Sword Tower and the Demonic Beast Sect were eliminated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had been worried that a Martial Saint would come for him, but he didn’t expect it to really happen. Qing Shui couldn’t help but be worried at the mere thought of the terrifying strength possessed by a Martial Saint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t think of any other Martial Saints who would look for trouble with him other than the one from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He raised his speed to its peak and expanded his spiritual sense. The moment he came out from the basement, he could felt a burning aura that scorched the heavens in the public square.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was certain that this was the strength possessed by a Martial Saint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without thinking, Qing Shui bolted towards the hill at his top speed. That hill had become his own place, although he rarely stayed there.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He stopped thinking too much. He needed to hurry with his fastest speed and activate the Violet Divine Crystal…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he was worried yet excited at the same time. He barged into the familiar room and quickly grabbed the Violet Divine Crystal to channel the Qi of Ancient the Strengthening Technique into it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In an instant, the entire Violet Divine Crystal emitted a dazzling violet light. At the same time, a boundless energy spread in every direction.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to put on his latest armor. With the Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Big Dipper Sword in his hands, he marched towards the public square.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come out, Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“AHHHHH!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A heaven shaking voice rang out clearly, accompanied by a blood-curdling scream!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you don’t come out, I will kill a person with my every yell!” The voice thundered, clearly audible to Qing Shui who was hurrying towards the public square.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tell me, who is the person that Qing Shui cared the most?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“AHHHHHH!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Another blood-curdling scream was heard! It was obvious that the person was killed for not answering the question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You tell me!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There’s no need for them to tell. I am the one!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A sudden wave of brute energy burst forth the moment from Qing Shui when he heard Canghai Mingyue’s voice. He let out an ear-splitting tiger roar towards the heavens.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha. Brat, even if you come out, I will still kill her and let you have a taste of a heartache before you die!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A hint of indescribable derangement could be heard in that sharp and clear voice!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You should check if your current strength is still at the Martial Saint level. Don’t die without even knowing how you died!” Qing Shui quickly spilled out the effects of the ‘Violet Divine Crystal’ in order to attract his opponent’s attention and stall for time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The public square was already crowded!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He wasn’t certain if this ‘Violet Divine Crystal’ could really indeed weaken a Martial Saint to a peak Martial King. If it could, then Qing Shui didn’t have to worry much as opponents below the Martial Saint level posed no threat to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha, who are you trying to kid? The wave of energy from earlier only lowered my strength by 20 %. Do you think that is enough for you to fight me evenly?” The clear voice was filled with disdain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His Cloudmist Steps was no longer the same as it was in the past. Qing Shui was able to make it there in time and saw the Martial Saint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was an old person!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Not that old either, but he gave off the feeling that he had lived for a long time. His silver hair danced in the wind, his figure slender and well-proportioned. His eyes were cold like steel and his snow-white eyebrows reached his shoulders.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He stood amongst the bodies of a few ordinary disciples who had fallen. Fresh blood stained the ground beneath his feet crimson.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Patriarch!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Patriarch!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……....</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled towards Canghai Mingyue who had a worried expression on her face. His smile instantly made her feel relieved!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was thinking at the same time. Why had the ‘Violet Divine Crystal’ only weakened the strength of his opponent by 20 %? This was not a funny joke.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who are you? Why are you making a ruckus in my Heavenly Palace?” Qing Shui was pissed! This Martial Saint had not only used unscrupulous methods to make him show himself, he had even resorted to massacring the weak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahahaha, who am I? You killed my younger brother. Tell me, is it wrong of me to kill you today?” The old man turned his electrifying gaze towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I killed your younger brother?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. Not only that, you have also eradicated his sect. Young man, do you know that you shouldn’t be so ruthless in doing some things?” The old man looked at Qing Shui, not even bothering to conceal the hatred in his eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, that’s right. I hail from the White Cloud Pavilion of the Central Continent. The Demonic Beast Sect was my younger brother’s sect. You need to bear the consequences of your actions,” the old man slowly took a step forward while glaring at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This single step carried a suppressive aura of a lofty mountain that could hide the heavens and cover the earth. The feeling of a heavy gigantic stone that crushed down on one’s chest was enough to make a person breathless.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the Violet Divine Crystal could only suppress about 20 % of the old man’s deep and immeasurable strength, Qing Shui still had to fight on. This was for the sake of himself, the ladies, and also the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Nature Energy was able to dissolve the pressuring aura that came from the Martial Saint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Along with the Divine Shield Talisman and the Godly Force Talisman, he was also under the effects of the Big Dipper Sword and the Violet Gold Divine Shield!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s strength had reached a total of thirty two countries while his defense had reached more than twenty countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Blue Lotus Art!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Three lotus flowers immediately surrounded him as protection!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With this, Qing Shui’s defense had reached a terrifying level of approximately forty five countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just when an unfathomable expression appeared on the Martial Saint’s face, Qing Shui summoned his Diamond Gigantic Elephant. At the same time, he locked on to the Martial Saint with his Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On top of the reduction of 20 % by the Violet Divine Crystal, his strength was reduced by a further 20 %!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the other hand, Qing Shui’s strength was once again raised immensely under the State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although his offensive power was slightly lacking, he was still able to achieve the strength of forty countries under the State of One with Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His defense, however, had achieved an absurd amount of more than fifty countries……!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Godly Armor Shield!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Violet Gold Divine Shield in Qing Shui’s hands glowed with a faint violet!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An all-out shield attack under the state of One with Elephant struck towards the old man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thump!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was one heavy strike. The qi force that radiated from the attack smashed the hard rocks on the ground to pieces. The ground within the radius of 100 meters was also in a disastrous state, and tremors could be felt.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui retreated three steps and jumped off the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. The old man on the other hand, only swayed slightly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although he didn’t take any steps back, Qing Shui saw a glimmer of hope the moment he swayed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The person standing against him was a Martial Saint cultivator. For him to be able to fight a Martial Saint cultivator, that single attack that forced him to sway was enough for him to live proudly on the Greencloud Continent for the remaining half of his lifetime.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man’s electrifying gaze locked onto Qing Shui, his eyes were filled with disbelief. With the longsword in his hand, he performed a straight thrust. His silhouette flashed by.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The longsword pierced towards Qing Shui like a dragon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel that the power in this sword attack seemed to have once again increased a little!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He clenched his teeth to endure the force of the attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man repelled Qing Shui with a single sword attack. Sidestepping once, he performed another jumping pierce towards him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Piercing Sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui exerted his strength cleverly, but he was once again sent flying from another sword attack. He threw out a Binding Talisman in midair!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man however, continued to relentlessly pursue Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui secretly lamented. This Martial Saint was indeed powerful. His strength had been reduced by 40 % while his speed had been reduced by 20 % and another further 30 % by the Binding Talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yet, even with half of his speed reduced the old man still appeared to be slightly faster than Qing Shui, despite Qing Shui’s current speed being decent. With his boots and a few pieces of armor, he had an additional 70% to his speed …….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He also had another 50% additional speed from the Grade Five Dark Jewel Necklace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bam bam boom…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Relying on his powerful body, Qing Shui clashed against the old man relentlessly. He continuously dished out the Art of Pursuing, Binding Talismans and Armor Break Talismans at the old man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most of the people within a radius of 100 meters had already evacuated a long time ago. The rocky surface beneath their feet was already heavily damaged and there were many deep ditches…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Blood leaked out of the corner of Qing Shui’s mouth. He had been waiting for his chance to use the Flickering Light Passing Shadow and Critical Damage. If he couldn’t succeed even once with those, then it would basically be impossible for him to win this.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As long as his opponent couldn’t cripple him with a single technique, he had the confidence to defeat him. Even if they had a big gap between them, Qing Shui still had the Great Revitalizing Pellet, although he tried not to rely on it if possible. One of the reasons was that the Great Revitalizing Pellet was too precious, secondly, Qing Shui wanted to improve himself through actual battles.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ferocious Diamond Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even under its full power of thirty two countries, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, when faced with a Martial Saint,was still unable to break the opponent’s defense.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It stopped fighting back!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui appeared increasingly pathetic while the old man’s attack grew increasingly aggressive!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This chain of attacks allowed him to sense the old man’s attack and defense. At the same time, his heart burned with a fighting spirit!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man’s speed suddenly increased as he bolted towards him in a half zig-zag pattern. He swept the longsword in his hand horizontally, leaving a trail of black shadows!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was almost as if a faint thunder rumbled in the air. The stifling atmosphere made him feel nauseous!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was panic-stricken!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that very moment, the longsword made contact with the Violet Gold Divine Shield...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Flickering Light Passing Shadow!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw a moment of relaxation appear on the old man’s fierce-looking face, he moved. His speed was raised by onefold by Flickering Light Passing Shadow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With his crafty footwork, he slid behind the old man. The Big Dipper Sword quickly slashed down on the old man’s back, so fast that it left a trail of afterimages.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Critical Damage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As luck would have it, Qing Shui discovered that the old man’s defense, after his strength had been reduced, was only slightly higher than Qing Shui’s attack power.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This sword attack completely neglected half of his defense!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was also very fortunate for Qing Shui that this sword attack was enough to claim the life of this unlucky Martial Saint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A mouthful of blood coughed out of the old man looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. His eyes were filled with so much disbelief that they didn’t shut even after his final breath…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The crowd immediately went still!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Patriarch won!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Patriarch defeated the Martial Saint!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Patriarch is so formidable!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Like that, every disciple of the Heavenly Palace in the public square became hot-blooded. They worshiped martial arts. Watching this kind of rare battle scene made them feel hot-blooded and amazed!</p>
