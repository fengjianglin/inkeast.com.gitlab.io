 <p><strong>AST 1473 - Slaughter, Refining Demons, Hell Nightmare Beast</strong></p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the man actually said something like this without taking into consideration his own identity. Qing Shui hated people who went back on their words more than anything. Naturally, by now, the intention to hold back was long gone from his mind.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike! Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately ordered the Thunderous Beast to unleash its Violet Lightning Strike. The time interval in which each strike was unleashed was calculated meticulously. This was one of Qing Shui’s formidable sure-kill moves. By now, the Dragon Slaying Beast had long since charged forward.</p>
 <p>The man’s face immediately turned pale. Though he was unable to move, he still retained his consciousness. He was indeed a really terrifying man. If his demonic beasts had been around him, they would have been able to deflect the opponent’s attacks for him.</p>
 <p>Though both of the Super Shield Beasts might be still around, both of their speeds had been significantly reduced. It’s impossible for them to block against the demonic beast.</p>
 <p>He has yet to unleash his Sure-kill Heavenly Technique. Unfortunately, he wouldn’t have had the chance to do so either.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>The man’s head disappeared. It was blasted apart by the Dragon Slaying Beast. And this was with the aid of only the Double Violet Lightning Strike. If it had been a triple or sextruple Violet Lightning Strike. Qing Shui would have been able to kill anyone it struck, on the condition that the Dragon Slaying Beast coordinated with him and that the opponent didn’t have the chance to block the attack.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With all of these together, the only fate which awaited the man was death. This was also what Qing Shui had planned from the beginning, and now, he had finally achieved his plan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, the people from the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley had also made their way here. Naturally, the Demon Lord Palace and Divine Sound Sect wouldn’t just stand there and watch them step into their territory. Both sides immediately started to face off against each other. Since things had already taken such a turn, there was no need to say anything more.</p>
 <p>In an instant, Qing Shui found ten people. He immediately used the Battle God Light Rings and set up the Four Symbols Formation. Each of the positions could accommodate quite a lot of people. This was Qing Shui’s modified version of the original Four Symbols Formation.</p>
 <p>The situation at the battleground was very bloody and intense. The Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider demonstrated its might at this moment and continuously shot out its Corrosive Poison Web from above. It even summoned swarms of spiders. The strength of the mutated demonic spiders was extremely strong, particularly some of the poisonous demonic spiders which possessed unique abilities.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Hell Inferno!</p>
 <p>The Ancient Fiery Snake breathed out layers after layers of Solar True Fire.</p>
 <p>Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Weaken, massacre! Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan along with some of the experts from Divine Sound Sect formed a formation and searched for the expert warriors from the opposing side. After that, the group worked together to instantly kill their opponents.</p>
 <p>Though the opponents might have set up their formations, Qing Shui still had his Nine Palace Confusion Steps and Crush up his sleeves. He managed to destroy the opponent’s formations right away with them. When coordinating with the Dragon Slaying Beast, it was really easy for him to destroy formations with shells. As for some of the positioning formations, Qing Shui was really proficient in them, so much that he could make changes to the opponent’s formations without even he himself realizing it.</p>
 <p>The intense battle continued. Both sides might have suffered &nbsp;injuries, but the number of people injured from the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley was significantly more than that of the Demon Lord Palace and Divine Sound Sect. Qing Shui’s squad was all the more fearsome in the battle. Together, they were like a sharp sword. Whoever got stabbed by them would die right away.</p>
 <p>Large explosions could be seen bursting out in the air in the surroundings. One after another, they caused even the sky itself to turn dusky. From time to time, an empty hole could be seen appearing within the smoke. From that hole, the night sky could be seen very clearly. Somehow, it was a really strange feeling. Standing in front of the enormous universe, it would somehow make one feel like he was really miniature and insignificant.</p>
 <p>Time went on little by little. The number of the injured and dead was only increasing. Qing Shui’s party and the demonic beasts were mainly the ones in control of the battle. In the middle of the fight, a lot of the experts from the Divine Beast Sect released their demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui took out the Soulshake Bell and also the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. Under their astonishing effects, the demonic beasts from the opposing side experienced a 50% reduction in strength. Even some of the powerful beasts were dramatically affected by it. Some of those attempted to run away, making the entire situation around the battleground all the more chaotic. They hurt quite a lot of people from the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley.</p>
 <p>The victor had long been decided. Quite a lot of people from the opposing side had begun to run away. This time, they had underestimated the Demon Lord Palace and Divine Sound Sect. The damage they received this time might be something which they would never recover from in five hundred years.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to pulverize the already defeated enemy. He pursued them as far away as a thousand li. Basically, most of the expert warriors had already died, and only a minority of them managed to use some hidden arts to run away.</p>
 <p>Basically, both the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley were considered to have lost the core strength of the sects. Even if the Demon Lord Palace or Divine Sound Sect didn’t do anything, there would be people who wouldn’t allow their existence. In fact, a lot of sects and aristocratic clans had received their achievements by stepping on the Divine Beast Sect.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui was about to leave, the two Super Shield Beasts were still there. The man had died. He was definitely one of the highest ranked within the Divine Beast Sect. As a matter of fact, he might even be the sect’s clan head. Unfortunately, he had died. Qing Shui also didn’t know the reason why the two beasts remained behind.</p>
 <p>Since they didn’t leave, Qing Shui planned to tame them. These things were treasures. With them supporting him, he would have many chances where he could unleash his battle techniques.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui attempted to communicate with them only to find it useless. They didn’t initiate any attacks, nor did they move.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, it’s useless. Since the man has died, they will also slowly meet their end here. Once a Super Shield Beast is tamed by someone, it would dedicate all of its loyalty to that one person. If that person dies, they will have no way of surviving either.” Tantai Lingyan neared Qing Shui and gently said to him.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, I am just testing my luck to see if anything unexpected will happen. It’s a waste to seem them die like this.” Qing Shui had read some introductions about the Super Shield Beast before. He originally wasn’t convinced that it would only stay loyal to one person.</p>
 <p>Seeing that there were no other methods left, Qing Shui came up with the decision to refine the demons.</p>
 <p>There were two types of demon refining processes. One refined a completely new being, whereas the other one just added an ability owned by a certain species of demonic beast onto another demonic beast, as if it was reborn. In the case of the latter, the demonic beasts were distinguished into the master beast and the secondary beasts. The master beast would usually be the demonic beast which remained after all of the processes took place. As for the secondary beasts, the only fate which awaited them was to disappear. They would retain some of their consciousness and later transfer it onto the demonic beast which remained.</p>
 <p>This way of refining demons had a high chance of failure, which was one of its most significant drawbacks. Else, Qing Shui’s demonic beasts would have been able to receive a lot of unique abilities. Qing Shui would only do this in a situation when he really couldn’t find any other alternatives to solve the problem. The demon refining process between beasts of the same species would have a significantly higher chance of success. But considering that the abilities between demonic beasts of the same species was identical, there was no point refining them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the two Black Diamond Rat Kings first before moving his sight onto the two Super Shield Beasts. After that, he immediately swallowed all of them with the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. He planned to mix them together and refine them. Though this might be a bit tough, the chance of success was also a bit higher. No matter what, as long as he could successfully refine the demons, everything would be fine. If he could only refine the two Super Shield Beasts, even a success would still be considered to be a failure.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui had planned to divide it into two tries. This way, he would have one more chance to do it. But then when he thought through it again more carefully, he thought it would be better for him to just refine them together. Only like this would the gap in strength between the master beast and secondary beasts be dragged away. One of the Super Shield Beasts was chosen to be the master beast. As for the rest of the beasts, they were all treated as secondary beasts. After mixing in the secondary beasts into the main one, Qing Shui refined the demons with the master Super Shield Beast. Considering that there was another Super Shield Beast acting as a secondary beast, the chance of success was still quite high.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui refined the demons, he looked for an excuse and entered the realm. He told the others to wait for him at the Divine Sound Sect’s courtyard. It’s just that before he left, he took off the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring in his hand and put it on Tantai Lingyan’s finger. He also made it recognize her as the owner. Before he removed it, he had already removed his Spiritual Sense from it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave her the instructions on how to use it. The ring was definitely considered a mini Divine Artifact weapon. It’s just that Qing Shui didn’t find it to be that useful. He had the Nine Palace Rules. Even if Tantai Lingyan cultivated the Nine Palace Steps, she would still never be able to surpass him no matter how hard she tried. This had nothing to do with the amount of talent a person had.</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan suffered from a bit of a mental shock upon seeing the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring in her hand. She wasn’t shocked with the ring itself. The thing which she was shocked about was the fact that she had let him put the ring on her finger.</p>
 <p>Across the continents, there were men who would give rings to women as well, particularly in the case of a man and a woman who loved each other. But for the ring which was stained with both the man and the woman’s blood, it had an even more special meaning.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui didn’t really think much about it. Tantai Lingyan, on the other hand, noticed that her heart had started to lose the calm it used to have before.. She no longer felt at peace with herself.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Within the realm, Qing Shui was controlling the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. From the outside, he blended in his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and Battle God’s strength into his Primordial Flame. The process of refining demons was a legendary existence which words couldn’t describe. The way it happened was by combining two things together and giving birth to a totally new being. The chances of failure were extremely high. But once the person succeeded in refining the demons, he would get the chance to obtain a formidable mutated beast.</p>
 <p>Zhi-zhi-zhi, roar!</p>
 <p>From time to time, beast roaring noises could be heard coming out from the furnace. The huge furnace, however, was slowly shrinking. Prior to this, it needed to enlarge itself in order to be able to swallow up both of the Super Shield Beasts. In the case of the Black Diamond Rat King, on the other hand, given its small size, the furnace neglected it and swallowed it along with the two huge beasts.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was continuously shaking. Qing Shui shut his eyes and constantly formed seals with his hands and shot them towards the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Roar...Zhi-zhi…...</p>
 <p>The noise was becoming louder and louder. At the same time, the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was also shaking more and more vigorously. With both of his hands, Qing Shui formed a complicated seal. The speed at which he formed his seal was also getting faster and faster, as if one moment of distraction would lead to the failure of the entire process.</p>
 <p>A thin and clear drop of sweat appeared on Qing Shui’s forehead. Time passed on little by little. Qing Shui couldn’t be bothered about how long it has been. The only thing he felt now was pain. He wanted to get rid of this state as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>For an unclear period of time, the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace began to shake less and less vigorously. It was also starting to get slower and slower until it came to a stop. But the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was still really huge even after it had shrank about one third of its size. This meant that there was fewer than half of the things left in the furnace compared to before. As to whether he would succeed, it was still unknown.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare let down his guard even once. The most dangerous moment might have passed, but it didn’t mean that Qing Shui could let loose. One careless mistake might lead to all the progress he had made up till now disappear. If it really failed at this time, Qing Shui would most definitely spurt out fresh blood.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the drawings on top of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace shined with bright light. A heavy noise came through. It was the roar of a beast capable of shaking the very core of one’s heart. Soon after, the light disappeared. Qing Shui was really surprised.</p>
 <p>Seven days of concentration without allowing even the slightest distraction. It had all turned out to be worth it. Qing Shui succeeded, he had actually succeeded!</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, the demonic beast which Qing Shui had refined from the demons would definitely end up being his tamed beast. This was Qing Shui’s ability. He right away figured out this method knowing that he couldn’t tame the Super Shield Beast. It was an effective method, but at the same time, it also came with huge risk.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was about to withdraw the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. At the moment, his heart was beating extremely quickly. He wanted to see what demonic beast it could be. At the instant Qing Shui withdrew the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, he was stunned.</p>
 <p>Hell Nightmare Beast!</p>
 <p>This demonic beast looked 80% like the Super Shield Beast. It was huge and heavy. But somehow, because of its claws and skull, it shared a bit of resemblance with the Black Diamond Rat King. The only difference was that compared to the rat, the Hell Nightmare Beast looked more mighty.</p>
 <p>The Hell Nightmare Beast was an existence almost equivalent to and as strong as the Dragon Slaying Beast. Somehow, Qing Shui had a feeling like he had sunk deep within a world of happiness.</p>
