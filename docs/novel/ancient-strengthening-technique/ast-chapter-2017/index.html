 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t let Little Rin chase after the big beast. It was too smelly and at the same time, there was no need for him to reveal Little Rin’s strength in front of so many outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A member of the Great Sun Immortal Sect was dead and the other one was heavily injured. Even Lei Bao was inflicted with some wounds. Thus, when everyone saw the fearsome beast run away, they couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief and quickly thanked Qing Shui, “Brother Qing, thank you for coming here for us. We owe you one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are welcome, Brother Lei. I haven’t really done anything, it just ran away on its own.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Bao wasn’t an idiot. Huge beasts like that wouldn’t just run away on their own. Even though he wasn’t sure about the clear reason why it escaped, he knew that it definitely had to do with Qing Shui and the others. It was very obvious that Qing Shui was the leader among their group of three. The two girls seemed very obedient. Seeing that, he didn’t really know how he should feel. To think that a woman like Beiming Xue would also act obediently… Had they slept together before? Had Qing Shui taken advantage of her? Was she wild or obedient in bed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a man saw a particularly beautiful woman, and then saw a man beside her, he would definitely feel envious of the man’s luck with women. After that, he would start to imagine the scenes which were likely to take place between the man and the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Bao was sad to see his dead partner. He dug a hole to bury him. While he was doing that, he also mentioned a few emotional words. However, Qing Shui knew that Lei Bao wasn’t really as upset as he looked. After all, they weren’t that close with each other to begin with. It was just a temporary alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only person left was the one who suffered heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Qing, you are a physician, can you please try to attend to his wounds?” Lei Bao seemed to just remember about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Lei Bao felt that everything which he did in exchange for being friendly back then was worth it. Not only did Qing Shui help him to survive just now, but he might also be able to save the life of his other partner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded. This person had suffered very heavy injuries. Almost all of his organs were crushed. On top of that, he was also losing a lot of blood from his wounds. If he was left under this condition for an hour, he would most likely die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was quite swift at curing the injured person. People could easily get confused just by looking at it. After an hour, Qing Shui kept his needles and fed the person a medicinal pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, everyone could tell that he was on the verge of dying. But now, much to their surprise, he was slowly recovering. Even the two young ladies were shocked by it. None of them had witnessed Qing Shui’s medical skills before. They were amazed by how strong he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging by the number of injuries he sustained, even if Qing Shui was able to cure him, they felt that he would still end up crippled. They wouldn’t be that surprised if he managed to stay alive. What they didn’t believe was that he could recover by tomorrow, but from how the patient was at the moment, about 20% of his injuries had healed. Seeing that, they started to have a feeling that he might truly be back to normal again by tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Bao had a feeling that this time, he had taken the correct path. No matter what it took, he must build up a good relationship with this man. Suddenly, he remembered that the people from the Bright Moon Palace didn’t show up. Those self-centered bastards…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the place was quite empty and wide, Qing Shui felt that it was about time for him to take a break. He casually set up a tent and immediately went into the realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls, on the other hand, set up a camp. Little Rin was guarding in the middle of their camps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Little Rin around, Qing Shui wasn’t worried at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Xuan, were you aware that Qing Shui’s medical skill was actually that powerful?” Beiming Xue looked at Yu Xixuan curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I had no idea about that. My deepest impression of him comes solely from his decent cultivation and the fact that he is able to make delicious food.” Yu Xixuan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, she witnessed Qing Shui defeating Clan Head Lang. Thus, she felt that he was strong. However, at that time, she wasn’t convinced that he would stand a chance against her. Only after his fight on the platform, did she recognize his true might. Later on, he mentioned that he was an alchemist and even helped both her and Beiming Xue double their strength. By then, she realized that she was no match against this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the battle against Little Rin, both of the young ladies knew that even if they worked together, they would still be unable to match this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was cultivating non-stop inside the realm. He focused more on the Buddha Ultimate Art and some of the seals. The Buddha Light Treasure Qi didn’t only nurture his body, it even boosted the functions and the toughness of the organs across his body. Even if Qing Shui didn’t weaken Little Rin, it should still be very difficult for it to injure him. He felt that his entire body was like a Diamond Buddha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a look at the armor and battle axe left behind by the Violent Axe Battle God before putting it together. When he returned, a Violent Axe Battle God Inheritor would emerge. If he planned to strengthen the Battle God Palace, the most important thing he must do was to look for more Battle God Inheritors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it was daytime once again, Qing Shui walked out of the tent. Lei Bao and the person from the Wang Clan came out. The person looked a bit weak, but he had managed to recover up to half of his strength. At the moment he saw Qing Shui, he quickly bowed down, “Wang Zhong is very thankful to Mister Qing for saving my life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s alright, I am a physician. To me, this is like lifting up my arms. You don’t have to mind it.” Qing Shui waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, Qing Shui didn’t mind saving Wang Zhong at all, nor did he ever hope for him to repay him or anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know that this may not mean much to Mister Qing, but it is very important to me as well as for the Wang Clan. I don’t know how I can repay you. I don’t think Mister Qing will fancy the things that I have with me. However, I am also aware that Mister Qing is a miraculous physician. Since that’s the case, what I have here is a medical prescription from my ancestors time. However, it looks very old and ragged, it’s useless for me. Mister Qing, please take it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Wang Zhong finished speaking, he took out an old Beast Parchment and handed it over to Qing Shui. He was very polite and was very thankful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knitted his brows; he didn’t refuse to take it. Just like what Wang Zhong said, it wouldn’t have mattered if it was some ordinary stuff, but since it was a medical prescription, he might as well take a look at it. Since Wang Zhong life was saved by him, it wasn’t unacceptable of him to accept a gift since he was his savior. Besides, it was just an old medical prescription. If Yuan Su was here, he could have gotten her to complete it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned the moment he took over the medical prescription. It felt like it was made of Beast Parchment. Nevertheless, this was without a doubt no ordinary Beast Parchment; he had a feeling that it was very valuable. For a medical prescription to require such a valuable Beast Parchment to write on, this came to show that this medical prescription must be very powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The name of the medical prescription was the Tribulation Avoidance Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the way it was named, it seemed to be used to avoid tribulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below it, there was a list of medicinal herbs. He had seen most of them before. They were all very precious herbs. There were also some ingredients which Qing Shui had never come across, for example, the Redcloud Grass, Tilted Moon Branch, and the Lightning Fruit.</span></p>

Deep down, Wang Zhong was feeling very nervous. He also looked very embarrassed. Even though this thing was passed down in the Wang Clan, actually, there wasn’t much value to it. It seemed a bit stingy of him, giving this to the person who saved him to show his gratitude.</span></p>

For example, the Redcloud Grass, Tilted Moon Branch, and the Lightning Fruit. Do you know where I might be able to find them?”</span></p>

It’s located further up north in the Northern Ice Domain. That place should already be considered as a part of the True Nine Continents World. That’s where the Redcloud Valley can be found. It is a dangerous place, but it is also the only location where you can find the Redcloud Grass. You must stay alert while you are there.”</span></p>
