 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ghost King, what are we supposed to do now?” Beiyuan Cao asked, his question full of unease.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength of the Nalan Clan still made Beiyuan Cao fearful. At their height, the Beiyuan Clan could only rely on external experts to resist them. As for the other local clans and powers, they all took the Beiyuan Clan as their leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Find out all the powerful people that the Nalan Clan has recruited. We have to get rid of them. If not, there is a high possibility that our efforts will go to waste.” The old man’s ghastly eyes shone with extra gloominess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tai Long, investigate. Try to look for any strange occurrences in the Nalan Clan, and don’t leave out a single clue,” Beiyuan Cao ordered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A middle-aged man suddenly stood up, “I will go immediately!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This concerned the fate of the clan, so everyone was very forthcoming. The Ghost King came from a very prominent sect in another domain. He had been kicked out of his sect, but managed to become a supreme expert on his own, despite his inability to return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was always at the Beiyuan Clan’s house and was treated as a distinguished guest. He lived a good life with them and had also done many things for the Beiyuan Clan in the past few years, allowing the clan to prosper and become one of the strongest, just under the Nalan Clan. There were hopes of replacing them as the Water Nation’s hegemon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were but a stone’s throw away from succeeding. Yet, such a disaster had occurred. This was naturally a severe mental blow to the entire clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, it was necessary to investigate the case of the Water Emperor’s curing and whether it was intentional or unintentional. If they allowed the Nalan Clan to counterattack, they would be done for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, Qing Shui became more and more relaxed. The number of powerful individuals in the Nalan Clan gradually increased, while the pressure on him became smaller and smaller. Now that he had cured the members of the Nalan Clan, battling against the Beiyuan Clan would not require much effort. However, whether or not he had to play a role in the battle, only time could tell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, after treating many patients, Nalan Qing and Qing Shui went on the streets for a shopping spree. The current street was special in that no carriages were allowed. Everyone had to travel on foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not the first time that both of them had gone shopping together. The pedestrian street was also called “couple street”. The name came from the fact that there were many couples milling about, lovingly holding hands, with arms around each other’s waists. The people there were all relatively younger, and this was the first time both of them had come to this street together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was fine with coming here to Pedestrian Street, or rather, Couple Street. It was not Qing Shui’s first time there, but it was Nalan Qing’s first time coming here alone with a man. She, naturally, felt slightly flustered. Many people around them were all being intimate. There were even some couples brazenly kissing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere was similar to the past world’s, or maybe even more open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Shui, let’s have a change of location, shall we?” Nalan Qing said stiffly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? Isn’t this place nice and quiet?” Qing Shui answered with a slight smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took a good look at the surroundings, before an expression of understanding washed over his face. He grabbed her small palm and said, “Sorry, I overlooked how you felt.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing was a bit panicked, but it was with more disbelief that she glanced at Qing Shui. She thought she heard wrong, but she knew that she did nothing wrong. She only underestimated this man’s shamelessness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She tried to pull her hand back twice, but to no avail, “We aren’t even in a relationship. You’re not allowed to hold my hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui sheepishly smiled, “I’m here all alone, but you have your family and loved ones here… Can’t you spare me a bit of warmth?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing was at a loss for words, her heartbeat starting to race. Previously, during the meal, he had held her hand, but it was only for a short while. This time, she’d been caught firmly by him. She felt so nervous that her palms began to sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You look nervous.” Qing Shui grinned at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You wish. I’ll just pretend that I’m pulling along a pet.” Nalan Qing avoided his gaze, but her face was flushed red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was surprised by this cold-looking lady’s shyness. At that moment, the soft and tender skin of her cheek was a deep shade of red, and it was inexplicably attractive. The sight of a beautiful lady blushing was sublime, igniting a fire in people’s souls with fatal attraction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui held her tender hand which was as warm as jade. He used a finger to lightly trace her palm, causing Nalan Qing to tremble slightly. She sternly warned him, “If you continue your sneaky actions, you’re no longer allowed to hold my hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were fewer and fewer people the further they went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they walked past a small stall, an old woman warmly smiled and called out to them, “Both of you! Your wife is very beautiful. This hairpin would surely suit her!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hairpin was white in color and crystal clear, bright and transparent like a jade. A feeling in Qing Shui’s gut told him that this object was not common. In fact, it seemed to be pretty rare. If Qing Shui had found this on his own, he probably would have bought it. However, it was the question of the old woman holding it up and trying to sell it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How much is it?” Qing Shui reached out to grab the hairpin while asking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It can’t be paid with money, only with your life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old woman began her sentence smiling, but suddenly yelled out at the end. The hairpin she was holding in her hand was immediately shot towards Qing Shui’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything happened too fast, but it was too bad that the old woman had underestimated Qing Shui’s skills. Looking at the white hairpin now, it seemed to be quite a sharp weapon. Qing Shui calmly reached out, and gave her wrist a hard pinch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ka-cha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At the same time, he pinned down her Quchi Acupoint, causing her whole body to be limp. At this moment, passersby around them began to scatter, but a few busybodies still stood there watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui simply waved his hand and the old woman transformed into a middle-aged woman who paled and stared fiercely at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Answer me. Who are you?” Qing Shui lightly questioned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can just kill me. I’ll never disclose who I am,” The woman coldly scoffed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why do you want to kill me?” Qing Shui continued interrogating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is futile to continue asking. I’ll never tell you anyway.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me take a guess. When I first arrived here, I did not offend anyone. If I have to point fingers at someone, it would be the Beiyuan Clan. I don’t care who you are, but I’ll be classifying you under the Beiyuan Clan.” Qing Shui smirked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whatever.” the woman said, her expressions calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you dare to come and kill me, you’ll have to undergo punishment by me. Oh, how shall I punish you? Sister Nalan Qing, do you have any ideas?” Qing Shui did not loosen the firm grip he had on Nalan Qing’s hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have no idea,” Nalan Qing truthfully said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This woman is slightly older. If I abolish her cultivation powers, strip her naked and throw her clothes across the streets with beggars, don’t you think the beggars will be grateful for me?” Qing Shui said with all seriousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing shivered, but the woman was even more afraid. She glared coldly at Qing Shui, “You’re a monster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve never been soft on people who wanted me dead. Since you don’t want to cooperate with me, why must I let you off so easily?” Qing Shui smiled, before reaching out and abolishing her cultivation powers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you let me go, how far will I be allowed to go?” The woman was facing a strong dilemma on the inside. If she disclosed information, she would surely die. If she did not say anything, she would also die. If she disclosed information and was allowed to flee, there might still be a small chance of surviving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui thought for a while, “If what you say is really true, and is useful to me, I promise you that I will ensure your safety. However, if you lie to me, I will show you what it means to be better off dead. I have a technique that will torture you but make sure you won’t die, suffering a year yearning for death.”</span></p>
