 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liancheng Biao didn’t talk right away. He knew that his fifth uncle still had more to say. Once the things became related to his clan, he would also take it more cautiously. He would be alerted. He has heard and also witnessed the annihilations of a lot of clans before. Most of the time, it was caused by very minor problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Shui might be very young, he was very cautious towards him. Since his seniors were here, it’s best if he let his fifth uncle handle it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, no matter how you put it, Liancheng Clan was still an influential clan. Since young, Miss Sheng was already arranged to get married to Biao`Er. Her father was also present when such an arrangement was set. May I know the reason why you are trying to stop it? Could it really be because you think that there is no one from Liancheng Clan who could deal with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man whom Liancheng Biao addressed as his fifth uncle took a few steps forward and said in a tone which sounded neither servile nor overbearing. He wanted to make clear first that he was from Liancheng Clan. He treated Qing Shui politely so that in the future, if there was any ruckus which might cause them some losses, they might still be able to prevent it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time the old man took a step forward, he would leave some space for himself. The space was just appropriate enough for him to retreat. He didn’t want to force himself to a dead end. Otherwise, if anything happened, the only thing which awaited him would be death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “I don’t want to make enemies with anyone. Though Liancheng Clan might be very powerful and had control over the Heaven Star Immortal Sect, I don’t like to see my friends get bullied. I don’t have many friends, hence, each and every one of them means a lot to me. So, as long as I am around. I will definitely not stand aside and watch as they get bullied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man slightly knitted his brows. He didn’t talk straight away. He seemed to be weighing the pros and cons of the issue and figuring out a way to solve it. Meanwhile, Qing Shui was looking at him waiting for him to talk again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also didn’t want to make enemies wherever he went. Even if the person he met might not necessarily be a good person. However, he wasn’t afraid of making enemies with them. He thought of battling against other people as a kind of joy. Though he wasn’t willing to fight with others, it would be very frustrating if he had to stop engaging in the battles forever. A warrior’s life was restless. They would never stop battling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about this? Battle me. If you lose, don’t interfere in today’s matter. If you win, we will leave immediately and never talk about Biao`Er’s marriage with Miss Sheng ever again. Does this sound fine with you?” The old man looked at Qing Shui and said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed a faint smile. The old man’s words weren’t as simple as it sounded. If he lost, let’s not talk about him interfering in this matter, he might be slaughtered into pieces right on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he won, however, they would see through his potential and refused to make enemies with him. The old man was the strongest among his group of people. If even he lost, the only thing which awaited them would be to get beaten up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, the old man’s method could be described as “advancing forward if possible, and retreating if it was time to protect themselves”. He has prepared a retreating route for himself. However, it sounded really fair when coming out of his mouth. If any outsiders were present, it would make them feel that they had given in to Qing Shui. After all, Sheng Jun was the woman who had an existing wedding contract with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Qing Shui spoke, he was interrupted by Sheng Jun. She said to him, “He is very powerful. If you are unable to defeat him, your life will be put in danger. If you don’t make your move, there is a chance that they will not act blindly without thinking. At the moment, they still don’t know about your background.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun just realized that she also didn’t know about his background. However, Qing Shui has told her quite a few things about himself. She just wasn’t sure whether what he said was true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and looked at Sheng Jun. They wouldn’t let the outsiders knew what they were saying. He looked at Sheng Jun’s concerned look and said in a confident tone, “Don’t worry about it, they are no match against me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t just being arrogant. Though he was unable to completely sense the old man’s strength with his Spiritual Sense, he was able to figure out roughly where they were at. His Spiritual Sense was still quite sensitive to certain dangers. In the case of the old man in front of him, he didn’t manage to sense any of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I accept your suggestions. I also hope that we can do things according to what we originally agreed on.” Qing Shui squinted his eyes and looked at the old man opposite him. The coldness in his eyes made the old man felt as if there was a thorn in his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a very dangerous young man with a formidable background. The old man has not had the slightest idea where this young man came from. For now, even if he was able to kill Qing Shui, he also didn’t know if he would do it. After all, he didn’t know who was behind him and what kind of strength the person might possess. He wasn’t convinced that an outstanding young man like him, wouldn’t have any fearsome force supporting him from the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, it was already impossible for him to stop halfway. Beating Qing Shui remained the priority. He could figure out the rest of the things after he did it. If he couldn’t manage to beat him, then it’s enough said. In the future, this young man was bound to achieve great things. If people like him didn’t die, even if they were unable to be friends, he knew that he mustn’t make enemies with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured. Though I won’t say that I am a good man, I don’t see myself as such a sinister person either. Anyone who is familiar with me will know that I never go back on my words. I hate people who do things different from what they say. Not only going back on their words but also thinking as if their speech can bring up storms.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful!” Sheng Jun gave Qing Shui a gentle reminder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Luckily, your father is gone. Otherwise, your father would have been greatly pressured fighting this match.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, my father loves me very dearly.” Sheng Jun said softly. She seemed a bit helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “I know, prior to this, he looked for exactly this opportunity to leave. I am his opportunity. If I wasn’t here, even I am not sure how things would have turned out. But standing in your father’s shoes, there is nothing he could have done to solve this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know, it’s just that I am unable to understand him.” Sheng Jun looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone would have things which they were helpless with. I am also a father. All of my daughters were already adults. I will not interfere at all regarding their marriages. At most, I will help them check out their grooms. I understand how a father thinks. If he isn’t out of options, he also wouldn’t let his own daughter suffer.” When Qing Shui thought about Qing Yin and Luan Luan, he felt a sense of warmth in his heart. He told himself that he must be powerful for their sake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are a good father.” Sheng Jun smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You will know when you are someone’s mom in the future.” Qing Shui looked at Sheng Jun and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And here you go again with your nonsense.” Sheng Jun wasn’t angry. She was just feeling a bit insecure. It seemed like a very distant thing for her to be someone’s mom. It just seemed so far away for her. Such thought had never once crossed her mind, nor did she know whether it would happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped speaking and started walking towards the old man in the distance. He held the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand whereas the old man was holding a thin sword. It had the length of five feet and the thickness of a wood. Its body looked transparent like jade. The sword itself was faintly discernible. It also gave out a weird aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Assassin’s Sword, the sword belonging to an assassin. Furthermore, it was a semi-Divine Artifact grade weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This reminded Qing Shui of the famous sword, Cheng Ying from his previous incarnation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t sure what exactly was unusual with the old man’s sword. The sword blade looked very blurry and it was also giving out intense chilliness. If it wasn’t for Qing Shui’s outstanding eyesight, he wouldn’t have noticed that the old man was holding a weapon.</span></p>
