  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>&nbsp;AST 532 - Qing Shui Taking Over the Heavenly Palace, Establishing Might, Kill&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a total of nine gongs!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Did I hear that correctly? There was actually nine gongs!” many people cried out in surprise at the square.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You did not hear wrongly, it was nine gongs, but it has nothing to do with us.” Some people just continued their morning practice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Master, let’s go!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!” Cang Wuya was very happy now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shortly after leaving, they saw Di Chen! Qing Shui smiled at her!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Good morning, Old Master!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young Lass Chen, let’s go together!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They kept bumping into the supreme elders of Heavenly Palace on the way there, Qing Shui just found out that there were 500 supreme elders in the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For a big sect with hundreds of thousands of people, 500 was not many, but it was not a force that can be overlooked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Cang!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Yan!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many people greeted Cang Wuya on the way. Di Chen was wearing a veil, thus no one noticed her, and Qing Shui was behind. However, Qing Shui could feel the gazes of many people on him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Look, Isn’t that Qing Shui behind Cang Wuya?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Zheng, that’s enough, don’t say too much!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These old monsters had lived for many years, but had not experienced much, thus when Qing Shui showed up here, it seem abnormal. Him attending the elder’s meeting was even more abnormal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Look, why is that invalid attending the elder’s meeting as well?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sudden voice was not loud, but many people could hear it clearly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, he couldn’t be here to attend the elder’s meeting right?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Jin, you’ll never know, haha, I wonder what is this trash doing back in the Heavenly Palace.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not react at all, Cang Wuya and Di Chen looked at Qing Shui, especially Cang Wuya, he had a faint smile on his face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Those trash are just clowns, when you get the chance, just kill them.” Cang Wuya gently said to Qing Shui, but the people around them heard it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Cang, who are you saying is trash? I challenge you to a duel!” Old Man Feng shouted, acting like a supreme expert.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, stop messing around, when the Old Ancestor gets angry, who is going to shoulder the blame?” Old Man Jin quickly pulled Old Man Feng away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Cang Wuya did not even bother looking at them, he just continued to head towards the great hall of Heavenly Palace with Qing Shui and Di Chen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The great hall of Heavenly Palace!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the three of them arrived at the great hall, there were already 200 odd people in there and there were more arriving, many of them were standing together.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Cang, over here!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw someone waving to Cang Wuya!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya just smiled and waved back, bringing Qing Shui and Di Chen over.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were only about ten people here, but Qing Shui had met most of them before. The last time he had went to the Feng Clan, they were cheering for him, Qing Shui knew that these were Cang Wuya’s good friends.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This junior greets the following seniors!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, good good, hmm, why are you here?” You An asked straightforwardly, smiling at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Old Ancestor told us to come!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The few people here exchanged their greetings, after finding out that Qing Shui recovered his strength, they were incomparably happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, the great hall had filled up, there were more than 500 people. Qing Shui noticed that they were all old beyond compare, they were all unique except those pair of eyes gleaming with wisdom, eyes that seen the hypocrisy of the world, eyes that seen the changes of world affairs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and Di Chen were particularly eye-catching because Di Chen rarely attended such events, but as the Palace Mistress of one of the Nine Halls, it was normal for her to attend. What had caused them to be confused was why Qing Shui was here.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the Old Ancestor showed up, the whole hall became quiet, this old man who had controlled the Heavenly Palace for more than 300 years, had an atmosphere that caused people to be sorrowful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am here today to announce something!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor of the Heavenly Palace swept his eye through the crowd then continued to slowly say: “I believe everyone already knows, that my lifespan is coming to an end, I do not have many days left. While I am still alive, I wish to find a good successor, one that can control the situation.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was quiet below, there was not even a single sound. Everyone was looking at the Old Ancestor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor laughed as he looked at the people below, then he slowly said: “You should all be familiar with the person I found, he is Qing Shui.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His words caused a huge wave!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The originally quiet great hall immediately erupted into noisy chatter, even You An and the others stared at Qing Shui in disbelief.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It can’t be, the Heavenly Palace, such a big sect being handed over to a green brat.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Did I hear wrongly?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There are so many people here, even if ten died, it is still not his turn!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am not convinced, Just a trash who hasn’t even stopped drinking milk!” Old Man Feng’s voice was particularly loud and clear! In the great hall, the only person who would dare to speak like this with the Old Ancestor was probably only him, maybe he was taking advantage of the fact the Old Ancestor was nearing the end of his lifespan…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Feng Congyun, you are not convinced right?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the Old Ancestor calmly said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man’s tone of voice was subdued but Feng Congyun still quickly bowed. The Old Ancestor’s prestige of many years caused his heart to beat faster, however, he clenched his teeth and said, “Replying to the Old Ancestor, yes, everyone here is so old, yet you would hand the Heavenly Palace to a green brat. I am not convinced.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, He is not convinced and even humiliated you with his words, you have three breaths time to defend your honor!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Upon hearing the Old Ancestor’s words, the surrounding people quickly moved aside and left an open area!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“One breath’s of time is sufficient!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s too arrogant!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He is truly young!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The hot-bloodedness of youth!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He does not know the heights of heaven, what kind of place is this when a baby smelling of milk could be so impudent.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui faced the Old Ancestor and bowed, then he suddenly rushed towards Feng Congyun. His speed was not very fast but it had a unparalleled domineering air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even without wearing the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, holding the Big Dipper Sword or Violet gold divine shield, even without using the Heavenly Talisman, he had still attained the strength of thirteen countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Arrogant brat!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Congyun saw Qing Shui sending an empty handed strike at him, his eyes full of disdain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He ferociously stomped his left leg, his body had a faint layer of radiance, his arms doubled in volume, two thick and solid dragons of Xiantian Qi blasted towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tai Chi Single Whip!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without leaking a single bit of energy, Qing Shui used the Single Whip against those huge thick arms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was no explosively strong vigor, but the plain and simple palm caused one’s heart to tremble, there was a hint of destruction in them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Upon the first contact, Feng Congyun’s complexion changed, his eyes was filled with despair!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a huge muffled sound!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kacha…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a piercing sound as fresh blood spurted out, Feng Congyun had been blasted far away like mud by Qing Shui’s fist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had not even managed to let out a single groan…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, in this match, Qing Shui should be the one to die like this. To think that people had said that Qing Shui did not know the heights of heaven, that he was boasting, that he was ignorant…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strongest cultivator from the Starday Hall’s Feng Clan could not even withstand one hit…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The results had caused many people to swallow their earlier words!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not show any expression, as though he had done something insignificant. His explosive increase in strength had caused Qing Shui to not feel any pressure when standing in the midst of these old men.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Anyone else not convinced, just say the word, if you can prove your strength, I can give this position to you.” the Old Ancestor gently said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was no sound coming from below at all, you could hear a pin drop!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, there were many people who became restless. If they beat this fellow, the Heavenly Palace will be in their control, they could have whatever they wanted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am not convinced!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A short skinny old man stood out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This old man was shorter than most by a head, when his frail body moved there was occasionally a sound!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old ancestor silently nodded his head!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the old man with white hair dangling to his waist, he could tell that he was someone with great speed. Qing Shui unconsciously thought of Bai Gui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a flash, Qing Shui ferociously rushed at the old man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui’s Cloudmist Steps had reached the absolute peak of speed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he activated it, there was a tiger roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man’s complexion changed when he was stripped of 20% of all his abilities, he was even more frightened at the spirit of Qing Shui’s tiger roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such a spirit caused him to regret his life!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The most lethal and vicious move of the Tiger Form was used.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man’s upper body suddenly had a hole in it…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One move again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the start to the end, Qing Shui did not have any change in his expression. It was as though everything he did, he already knew the outcome, and from his facial expression, it appeared to be true.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These old men were shocked from the bottom of their hearts, because till now, they still could not see through Qing Shui’s strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This challenge had caused 80% of those who were restless earlier to feel a setback, but there were some who wish to try their luck.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want to challenge you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, it was not an ‘I’m not convinced’, but a challenge!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A tall powerful man walked out, he was clad in flowing blue robes, he had brown hair streaming around his head, he looked as ferocious as a lion.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Blue Lion of Heavenly Palace!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This time Qing Shui is finished, the Blue Lion must not have been willing to take this lying down.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Have you seen his huge blue ax and blue armor!” someone said in delight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ve seen it, is it very powerful?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Powerful? That huge blue ax increases one’s strength by 100%, the armor increases one’s defense by 100%, and those shoes increases one’s speed by 100%,” the earlier man spoke frankly with assurance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui no longer dared to be careless as he took out the Heaven Shaking Hammer!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, the tall powerful man ferociously rushed at Qing Shui. The huge blue ax in his hands sent a blue colored Qi Force toward Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strong vigor caused the surrounding supreme elder’s clothes to rustle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui squinted his eyes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Essence of the ferocious Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heaven Shaking Hammer in his hands exhibiting the Thousand Hammer Technique, like a sword splitting a mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Followed by that was another hammer strike!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Splitting Heaven, Shattering Earth!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was Qing Shui’s Thousand Hammer Technique, possible even Qing Shui’s move lethal move.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heaven Realm!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like that, it had achieved a frightening strength of fifteen countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The huge hammer had a domineering pressure that caused this powerful man to have a look of despair in his eyes, this was a gap that he would not be able to close.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Yan!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Many people greeted Cang Wuya on the way. Di Chen was wearing a veil, thus no one noticed her, and Qing Shui was behind. However, Qing Shui could feel the gazes of many people on him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Look, Isn’t that Qing Shui behind Cang Wuya?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Zheng, that’s enough, don’t say too much!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These old monsters had lived for many years, but had not experienced much, thus when Qing Shui showed up here, it seem abnormal. Him attending the elder’s meeting was even more abnormal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Look, why is that invalid attending the elder’s meeting as well?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sudden voice was not loud, but many people could hear it clearly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, he couldn’t be here to attend the elder’s meeting right?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Jin, you’ll never know, haha, I wonder what is this trash doing back in the Heavenly Palace.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not react at all, Cang Wuya and Di Chen looked at Qing Shui, especially Cang Wuya, he had a faint smile on his face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Those trash are just clowns, when you get the chance, just kill them.” Cang Wuya gently said to Qing Shui, but the people around them heard it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Cang, who are you saying is trash? I challenge you to a duel!” Old Man Feng shouted, acting like a supreme expert.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, stop messing around, when the Old Ancestor gets angry, who is going to shoulder the blame?” Old Man Jin quickly pulled Old Man Feng away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Cang Wuya did not even bother looking at them, he just continued to head towards the great hall of Heavenly Palace with Qing Shui and Di Chen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The great hall of Heavenly Palace!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the three of them arrived at the great hall, there were already 200 odd people in there and there were more arriving, many of them were standing together.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Cang, over here!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw someone waving to Cang Wuya!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya just smiled and waved back, bringing Qing Shui and Di Chen over.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were only about ten people here, but Qing Shui had met most of them before. The last time he had went to the Feng Clan, they were cheering for him, Qing Shui knew that these were Cang Wuya’s good friends.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This junior greets the following seniors!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, good good, hmm, why are you here?” You An asked straightforwardly, smiling at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Old Ancestor told us to come!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The few people here exchanged their greetings, after finding out that Qing Shui recovered his strength, they were incomparably happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, the great hall had filled up, there were more than 500 people. Qing Shui noticed that they were all old beyond compare, they were all unique except those pair of eyes gleaming with wisdom, eyes that seen the hypocrisy of the world, eyes that seen the changes of world affairs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and Di Chen were particularly eye-catching because Di Chen rarely attended such events, but as the Palace Mistress of one of the Nine Halls, it was normal for her to attend. What had caused them to be confused was why Qing Shui was here.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the Old Ancestor showed up, the whole hall became quiet, this old man who had controlled the Heavenly Palace for more than 300 years, had an atmosphere that caused people to be sorrowful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am here today to announce something!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor of the Heavenly Palace swept his eye through the crowd then continued to slowly say: “I believe everyone already knows, that my lifespan is coming to an end, I do not have many days left. While I am still alive, I wish to find a good successor, one that can control the situation.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was quiet below, there was not even a single sound. Everyone was looking at the Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor laughed as he looked at the people below, then he slowly said: “You should all be familiar with the person I found, he is Qing Shui.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His words caused a huge wave!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The originally quiet great hall immediately erupted into noisy chatter, even You An and the others stared at Qing Shui in disbelief.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It can’t be, the Heavenly Palace, such a big sect being handed over to a green brat.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Did I hear wrongly?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There are so many people here, even if ten died, it is still not his turn!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am not convinced, Just a trash who hasn’t even stopped drinking milk!” Old Man Feng’s voice was particularly loud and clear! In the great hall, the only person who would dare to speak like this with the Old Ancestor was probably only him, maybe he was taking advantage of the fact the Old Ancestor was nearing the end of his lifespan…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Feng Congyun, you are not convinced right?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the Old Ancestor calmly said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man’s tone of voice was subdued but Feng Congyun still quickly bowed. The Old Ancestor’s prestige of many years caused his heart to beat faster, however, he clenched his teeth and said, “Replying to the Old Ancestor, yes, everyone here is so old, yet you would hand the Heavenly Palace to a green brat. I am not convinced.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, He is not convinced and even humiliated you with his words, you have three breaths time to defend your honor!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Upon hearing the Old Ancestor’s words, the surrounding people quickly moved aside and left an open area!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“One breath’s of time is sufficient!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s too arrogant!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He is truly young!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The hot-bloodedness of youth!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He does not know the heights of heaven, what kind of place is this when a baby smelling of milk could be so impudent.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui faced the Old Ancestor and bowed, then he suddenly rushed towards Feng Congyun. His speed was not very fast but it had a unparalleled domineering air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even without wearing the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, holding the Big Dipper Sword or Violet gold divine shield, even without using the Heavenly Talisman, he had still attained the strength of thirteen countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Arrogant brat!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Congyun saw Qing Shui sending an empty handed strike at him, his eyes full of disdain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He ferociously stomped his left leg, his body had a faint layer of radiance, his arms doubled in volume, two thick and solid dragons of Xiantian Qi blasted towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tai Chi Single Whip!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without leaking a single bit of energy, Qing Shui used the Single Whip against those huge thick arms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was no explosively strong vigor, but the plain and simple palm caused one’s heart to tremble, there was a hint of destruction in them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Upon the first contact, Feng Congyun’s complexion changed, his eyes was filled with despair!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a huge muffled sound!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kacha…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a piercing sound as fresh blood spurted out, Feng Congyun had been blasted far away like mud by Qing Shui’s fist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had not even managed to let out a single groan…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, in this match, Qing Shui should be the one to die like this. To think that people had said that Qing Shui did not know the heights of heaven, that he was boasting, that he was ignorant…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The strongest cultivator from the Starday Hall’s Feng Clan could not even withstand one hit…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The results had caused many people to swallow their earlier words!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not show any expression, as though he had done something insignificant. His explosive increase in strength had caused Qing Shui to not feel any pressure when standing in the midst of these old men.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Anyone else not convinced, just say the word, if you can prove your strength, I can give this position to you.” the Old Ancestor gently said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was no sound coming from below at all, you could hear a pin drop!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, there were many people who became restless. If they beat this fellow, the Heavenly Palace will be in their control, they could have whatever they wanted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am not convinced!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A short skinny old man stood out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This old man was shorter than most by a head, when his frail body moved there was occasionally a sound!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old ancestor silently nodded his head!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the old man with white hair dangling to his waist, he could tell that he was someone with great speed. Qing Shui unconsciously thought of Bai Gui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In a flash, Qing Shui ferociously rushed at the old man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui’s Cloudmist Steps had reached the absolute peak of speed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he activated it, there was a tiger roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man’s complexion changed when he was stripped of 20% of all his abilities, he was even more frightened at the spirit of Qing Shui’s tiger roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Such a spirit caused him to regret his life!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The most lethal and vicious move of the Tiger Form was used.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man’s upper body suddenly had a hole in it…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One move again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the start to the end, Qing Shui did not have any change in his expression. It was as though everything he did, he already knew the outcome, and from his facial expression, it appeared to be true.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These old men were shocked from the bottom of their hearts, because till now, they still could not see through Qing Shui’s strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This challenge had caused 80% of those who were restless earlier to feel a setback, but there were some who wish to try their luck.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want to challenge you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, it was not an ‘I’m not convinced’, but a challenge!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A tall powerful man walked out, he was clad in flowing blue robes, he had brown hair streaming around his head, he looked as ferocious as a lion.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Blue Lion of Heavenly Palace!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This time Qing Shui is finished, the Blue Lion must not have been willing to take this lying down.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Have you seen his huge blue ax and blue armor!” someone said in delight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ve seen it, is it very powerful?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Powerful? That huge blue ax increases one’s strength by 100%, the armor increases one’s defense by 100%, and those shoes increases one’s speed by 100%,” the earlier man spoke frankly with assurance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui no longer dared to be careless as he took out the Heaven Shaking Hammer!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, the tall powerful man ferociously rushed at Qing Shui. The huge blue ax in his hands sent a blue colored Qi Force toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The strong vigor caused the surrounding supreme elder’s clothes to rustle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui squinted his eyes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Essence of the ferocious Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heaven Shaking Hammer in his hands exhibiting the Thousand Hammer Technique, like a sword splitting a mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Followed by that was another hammer strike!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Splitting Heaven, Shattering Earth!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was Qing Shui’s Thousand Hammer Technique, possible even Qing Shui’s move lethal move.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heaven Realm!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like that, it had achieved a frightening strength of fifteen countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The huge hammer had a domineering pressure that caused this powerful man to have a look of despair in his eyes, this was a gap that he would not be able to close.</p>
