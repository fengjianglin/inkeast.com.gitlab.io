 <p><strong>AST 1116 - Beitang Clan's Final Trump Card (2)</strong></p>
 <p>Very soon, many people were devoured by the ‘black-colored demonic beast’, and there were also many people who were poisoned by the extremely venomous poison. In such a short period of time, over a hundred people died.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to run. People that I, Beitang Yiyao, wants to kill, won't ever get to escape." The old man suddenly appeared before Yin Lang and Yinyue Hu.</p>
 <p>He struck out and casually tapped out with his cane. The cane looked just like an ordinary branch from a dead tree. However, Yin Clan's head and Yinyue Clan's head were both unable to avoid that attack.</p>
 <p>The cane brought about a layer of greyish-black aura. It tapped on their chest, just like how it tapped against Beitang Yingji's chest. However, this time around, it was an instant kill.</p>
 <p>It was a very clean move and the corpses blackened very quickly. This poison was so strong that it made one turn numb just from looking at it being used.</p>
 <p>This branch of mine is a 10,000 Years Poison Dragon Wood Heart. You'll have to be careful." After killing quite a number of people from Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan, the old man looked at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>"Violet Dragon Mountain, since you guys are going this far, don't think about returning." The old man then looked toward Zilong Shi and the others before suddenly dashing out towards them.</p>
 <p>Zilong Shi had a horrified expression. He didn't want to die and hadn't expected that Beitang Clan would still have an old monster like this. In fact, it was said in the past that they had an old monster but later on, people said that the monster was no longer around and had died. There were even many people in Beitang Clan who didn't know of the existence of Beitang Yiyao.</p>
 <p>Zilong Shi wasn't the only one horrified. Many others had similar sentiments. However, they didn't dare to leave. Right now, no one dared to get the attention of this old monster. Otherwise, death would be the thing that awaited them.</p>
 <p>"Alright, you've killed quite a number of people already. Let's start!"</p>
 <p>Just as Zilong Shi's expression changed, already felt like he was bound down. His body felt stiff and he couldn't move, as if he would be killed by this old monster anytime. Just then, Qing Shui's voice rang out and he also lashed out with his Primordial Flame Whip towards the old man's neck.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui stopped the old man with a flash. Zilong Shi felt the pressure on his body slowly disappearing and he quickly retreated after thanking Qing Shui profusely. He had managed to keep his life and he was thankful to Qing Shui from the bottom of his heart. In that situation, he had basically thought that he was dead meat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had done this intentionally. It was easy for him to save Zilong Shi and his goal today was met. The feud between Violet Dragon Mountain and Beitang Clan was now set in stone. Qing Shui was not expecting to wipe out all of the people from Beitang Clan today. He knew that there would definitely be people who would manage to get away. These people would eventually lose their lives to Violet Dragon Mountain in the future.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Qing Shui also wanted to use Violet Dragon Mountain to suppress the Lion King's Ridge in the future. The head of the Lion King's Ridge would change. Qing Shui did not intend on letting either party gain sole control. Moreover, he wanted to be in control of some influences. There would be no issues even if he were to leave the Five Continents. Taking ten years in the other Four Continents would not be considered long to cultivators like themselves.</p>
 <p>"Since you're in so much of a hurry, that's good too." The old man struck out his cane towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Great Emptiness Step!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wore a smile on his face and performed the Eight Trigrams Steps!</p>
 <p>At the same time, he circulated his Nature Energy to the maximum. He wasn't afraid of poison but the old man's cane was a 10,000 Years Poison Dragon Wood Heart. He wanted to be on the safe side. Right now, he couldn't afford any accidents.</p>
 <p>The old man looked at Qing Shui's silhouette and footwork, his eyes lit up with a throbbing gleam as he waved his palm.</p>
 <p>Azure Dragon Imprint！</p>
 <p>A pitch-black head that was huge and twisted like a Jiao’s head opened its big mouth. It released an extremely smelly breath as it flew towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Lion King's Imprint!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Lion King's Imprint directly and a bright golden lion's head crashed against that pitch-black Jiao's head.</p>
 <p>One of it had spirit energy with strong and intense poison; the other had spirit energy with Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Although both huge beast heads had shattered, Qing Shui's one shattered later. Therefore, he had gained the upper hand in this clash.</p>
 <p>"Too monstrous. To be honest, I don't even wish to kill you."</p>
 <p>The old man let out a sigh and swung his cane. A thick, black aura appeared in front of the cane. With a flash, he dashed out toward Qing Shui, smashing his cane toward him.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui channeled the powers of the Diamond Buddha Devil Staff into the Nine Continents Mountain and sent it smashing towards the old man directly.</p>
 <p>Yin Qi. Qing Shui could tell from just that corrosive chill alone how terrifying this old man was. Moreover, it was also extremely poisonous. Although the old man might not be as strong as Qing Shui, his techniques were definitely extremely evil.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that Qing Shui was an expert in dealing with such techniques.</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>A cooling and bright aura spread out with Qing Shui as the center, just like the sun. All evil and poisonous aurae in the surroundings completely disappeared...</p>
 <p>This was the overbearing power of Area Dominance. The place where Qing Shui stood would be absolutely clear and pure, rejecting all traces of evil. It was something that was on par with the Nine Palace Steps, allowing him to dominate the area around him!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>He channeled his spirit energy onto his Nine Continents Mountain, increasing its prowess by a lot. The old man's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation had an external layer which was like a black-colored armor. Although it barely managed to fend off Qing Shui's attack, the old man was sent flying back several meters.</p>
 <p>This was also considered one of Qing Shui's stronger abilities. It was an attack which transcended spirit energy. Additionally, it gave extra powers to the Nine Continents Mountain. They basically were able to merge completely. It might be due to the mysterious nature of the Nine Continents Mountain. If it was other things, the spirit energy might not be able to fully merge with them and it might even cause the prowess of the spirit energy to be restrained.</p>
 <p>A merge like this had the Nine Continents Mountain as the structure. Many times, it was in order to match with the spirit energy. When one was unable to gather and condense their spirit energy, they would need to use some items as the ‘rack’. For example, with Little Fatty's staff, he could allow the staff's attacks to be incorporated with spirit energy attacks.</p>
 <p>If one's spirit energy could be fully condensed, most people would just condense it, and the depletion would be slightly higher.</p>
 <p>Of course, a person could also tap on some other items. For example, the old man's 10,000 Years Poison Dragon Wood Heart could increase the prowess of his attacks. It was just that Qing Shui's Big Dipper Sword no longer had this effect. At his level, ordinary weapons were of no more use. The old man's 10,000 Years Poison Dragon Wood Heart was one which increased the poisonous effect.</p>
 <p>Area Dominance was perfect to deal with evil techniques like this, making the old man unable to perform his greatest attack. Qing Shui didn't know the percentage of the world's rules that the old man could ignore, nor did he know about the old man's techniques and special items. However, he sensed that the old man's abilities were at about two million stars.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Qing Shui had restrained the opponent's poison, making that old man's poison useless against him. This caused the old man's true powers to be reduced by 30-50%, since 90% of people were afraid of poison.</p>
 <p>The old man didn't give up and made a few more attempts. However, the poison all disappeared with no exceptions. If it was just in terms of strength alone, the old man was no match for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The old man waved his hand!</p>
 <p>Instantly, four demonic beasts appeared before him.</p>
 <p>Devouring Star Armor Beast!</p>
 <p>It was rumored that there were many of this kind of demonic beasts in the other Four Continents but there weren't many in the Five Continents. The four huge demonic beasts looked a lot like wild buffaloes. They stood there like a fort. They had four thick limbs and striped blue armor on their back. The beasts exuded a cold aura from all over their bodies. They were demonic beasts with an ice attribute, and were suitable for the cold region like the Lion King's Mountain. They would even be able to stay in the arctic regions.</p>
 <p>A strength of one and a half million stars. There were four of them, with one of them having a strength of close to two million stars. The strength of these demonic beasts wouldn't be that much higher even if they were in the other Four Continents, since the ability of the Devouring Star Armor Beast was to devour the world's pressure. However, there was a time limit to this and it didn't seem to be able to last very long. Such an attribute allowed the Devouring Star Armor Beast to be able to survive better in unique places.</p>
 <p>Ice Seal of Thousand Li!</p>
 <p>The four demonic beasts split into two groups and tried to dash up to Qing Shui, surrounding him. At the same time, they spewed out snow-white chilling aura which would freeze even the air as they passed by.</p>
 <p>Flames of Yin-Yang!</p>
 <p>What made Qing Shui astonished was that Area Dominance could fend off a small portion of the chill. In certain medicinal books, the chill was also known as cold poison. Could it be because of this? Fire was also known as fire poison...</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Qing Shui felt that the Area Dominance was truly very overbearing. With it being in this strong despite it being at a very low level of mastery, could it become even more powerful in the future? There might even be some mysterious effects.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could be considered to have fully restrained the old man. Qing Shui's physique was considered special to begin with. Furthermore, with the primordial flames to pit again the ice-attribute demonic beasts, he was able to stop them completely. He was much stronger compared to these demonic beasts and he whipped down on them.</p>
 <p>Terrifying cries rang out. Even those thick scale armors were useless. With a whip, Qing Shui sent them flying. The scene of huge demonic beasts being sent flying by the thin Primordial Flame Whip truly created a visual impact.</p>
 <p>The old man had initially thought that these four huge beasts would be able to hold back Qing Shui for a while. With him helping, they might be able to successfully suppress Qing Shui. However, he had forgotten that that their attributes were contradicting. While this was normal, Qing Shui was much more stronger compared to the Devouring Star Armor Beasts and his overwhelming prowess was displayed. The damage inflicted was at least 150% and even if they weren't instantly killed, they would also suffer serious injuries.</p>
 <p>The old man was aggrieved. His vicious abilities had been weakened by this lad to the extent that their prowess were wiped out. The old man's 10,000 Years Poison Dragon Wood Heart was had also seemed like it became a decor piece. Without all these, he was weaker than Qing Shui and there was no fight.</p>
 <p>What he didn't know was that Qing Shui had yet to utilize his Emperor's Qi. Otherwise, he would be even more astonished.</p>
 <p>The old man calmed down and looked at Qing Shui from afar. His expression was calm, as if he still had some hesitation. When Qing Shui saw the old man's expression, he felt a little uneasy. He didn't know why.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the ladies had already entered the formation, he calmed down a little and looked at the old man. "What are you still hesitating for? Now that things have come to this, if I don't die, then Beitang Clan would be the one to disappear."</p>
 <p>"Young man, actually, I really have a way to kill you and it would be over very quickly." The old man lifted his head to look at Qing Shui and then took out a red colored Demonic Beast Token.</p>
 <p>"Oh, if that's the case, why aren't you taking action?" Qing Shui looked at the Demonic Beast Token that the old man was holding.</p>
 <p>"Do you know what demonic beast is in this Demonic Beast Token?" The old man didn't answer Qing Shui but asked calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head and didn't say anything.</p>
 <p>"Golden Ni Lion, a real Golden Ni Lion." The old man looked at Qing Shui and spoke these words clearly. At least, many people were able to hear him clearly.</p>
 <p>Golden Ni Lion... Qing Shui was stunned. This was the old man's true trump card and also Beitang Clan's greatest trump card. But why had they not used it all of this time? To think that they were even hesitating at this point... Qing Shui was puzzled.</p>
