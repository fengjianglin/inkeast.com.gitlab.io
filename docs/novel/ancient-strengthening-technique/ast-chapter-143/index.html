 <p><strong>Chapter 143 Qingzhuang, I’ve Missed You.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0143 – Qingzhuang, I’ve Missed You</strong></p>
  <p>“I would like to ask for Qingzhuang’s hand in marriage!”</p>
  <p>After saying this, Qing Shui gazed at Shi Dingtian who was in a daze. Qing Shui thought that he would at most just pressure him. After all, it would be a waste not to use his skills. Of course, he would use his skills against the guy Shi Qingzhuang would be marrying!</p>
  <p>“Qingzhuang has been betrothed to the Situ Clan!” Shi Dingtian’s face sunk as he spoke calmly. The atmosphere was slightly pressuring!</p>
  <p>“That matter is easy to settle, just reject the marriage!” Qing Shui smiled gently and responded.</p>
  <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Shi Dingtian was slightly infuriated. It was not just the words Qing Shui spoke, but also the casual tone he spoke in.</p>
  <p>“Marriage is a big issue, and not child’s play. How could we reject them just like that? There must be a reason right for it!” Shi Dingtian stared and replied.</p>
  <p>“Reason? The reason is that I like Qingzhuang, and want to take her as my wife. This reason should be sufficient!”</p>
  <p>“No, this reason is too far-fetched. Situ Nantian and myself have tens of years of friendship, this betrothal had been arranged for over twenty years!” Shi Dingtian shook his head and said.</p>
  <p>“Then, would it be alright if I had already done the deed with Qingzhuang?” Qing Shui asked with some hesitation.</p>
  <p>“What? You rascal! The rumors were real?!” This time around, Shi Dingtian really was infuriated as he hollered!</p>
  <p>“Haha, what reason do you need? You just tell Situ Nantian outright that I want to marry Qingzhuang. I’ll beat up anyone who dares to fight me.” Qing Shui tried his best to say this in a straightforward manner.</p>
  <p>The reason Qing Shui had said this was because he could tell that Shi Dingtian had also wanted to reject the marriage with Situ Clan, but it was just that he could not find a proper justification. After all, both families had close ties. The people in the world of the nine continents valued promises and the keeping of them the most!</p>
  <p>Every time he saw his granddaughter’s gloomy expression, he would feel uncomfortable. He had inadvertently come to know that his granddaughter detested Situ Bufan, and that it was the cause of her depression. Despite this, he was helpless. Therefore, Shi Dingtian had kept delaying their wedding. That was also the reason why Shi Qingzhuang was still unwed at the age of 24 or 25.</p>
  <p>“You really like Qingzhuang? You are sure that you want to do this?” Shi Dingtian no longer asked Qing Shui for a reason as he changed his line of questioning.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui nodded. Like means like. A woman he had had could only belong to himself. As for love, it could be nurtured. After all, he liked her, therefore it would be much easier to fall in love with her. In fact, ever since Qing Shui had sex with her, he had an additional concern. This was love!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui nodded his head in affirmation!</p>
  <p>“Does Qingzhuang like you?” Shi Dingtian posed the question seriously.</p>
  <p>“I’m not sure, but I have the confidence to make her like me. Currently, she shouldn’t detest me. After all, we have done the deed…We can spend some more time together, and I will make her fall in love with me.” Qing Shui knew that so long as this Old Master agreed, the case would be settled.</p>
  <p>Actually, Shi Dingtian had made his plans long ago, but it was just that Qing Shui was still kept in the dark!</p>
  <p>“Sigh! I won’t meddle in the business of you youngsters, but leave issue of rejecting the marriage to me. If you were to be together with Qingzhuang, then I hope you will treat her better. Qingzhuang has not been happy all these years! She didn’t care about anybody, and would barely speak a word over several days!” Shi Dingtian sighed and spoke slowly.</p>
  <p>“Rest assured, while I am vicious towards my enemies, I treat my kin and women a thousand times better!” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“Hahaha! Alright, I like what you said, like a real man!” Shi Dingtian smiled!</p>
  <p>“Old Master, has Qingzhuang been well recently?” Qing Shui had heard from Shi Mushi the other time that Shi Qingzhuang had not been very happy recently. He took the opportunity to ask the Old Master!</p>
  <p>“Qingzhuang has been in a daze recently, and has even slimmed down a lot. In the past, she would go out every few days. But, recently she always seemed to be in a daze by herself, ignoring everyone else, and doesn’t feel like meeting anyone. She doesn’t even go out into the backyard.” Shi Dingtian sighed as he said this.</p>
  <p>“Old Master, can I go take a look at Qingzhuang?” Qing Shui asked worriedly.</p>
  <p>Shi Dintian frowned and hesitated as if it was something difficult!</p>
  <p>“Don’t worry, I will only take a look and try to cheer her up!” Qing Shui saw Shi Dingtian’s hesitation and quickly made his stance.</p>
  <p>“Alright, but if she doesn’t wish to see you then leave immediately!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui understood from the Old Master that Shi Qingzhuang stayed in the courtyard at the back, and was told of where she stayed. When Qing Shui headed towards the back, Shi Dingtian broked into a satisfied smile, like someone who was experienced and conniving.</p>
  <p>It was a small distance to the courtyard at the back, and Qing Shui looked at the surrounding scenery. The most spectacular sight was still the many pavilions, which were carefully laid out, and should have been designed by someone reputable. Qing Shui knew a bit about the five elements and eight trigrams, and had some simple Feng Shui knowledge as well. These pavilions were mostly next to mountains or water, and their geographical locations were not bad. </p>
  <p>The location of a place with excellent feng shui must have a good flow of Heavenly Qi birthed by mountains and rivers. Mountains stores wind, and would provide an auspicious location for the receival of Qi, both naturally and actively. On the other hand, water maintained vitality. While these were all artificial mountains and water, the theory still worked!</p>
  <p>The courtyard at the back was very spacious, with a small garden which had a few purple maple trees. A few crimson red leaves drifted down when the wind blew. It was already in late autumn, but there were still many trees which were still exuberant and flourishing!</p>
  <p>A lean and slender figure dressed in crimson clothing which was woven with feathers and long hair covering her shoulders stood underneath one of the purple maple trees. The scene had a lonely feeling, but yet it seemed to blend in well with the surroundings; a harmonized yet lonely scene.</p>
  <p>A back view… an extremely beautiful back view… but a lonely back view. Qing Shui could tell at one glance that it was Shi Qingzhuang. But, when he saw her back view which had such a strong sense of loneliness that it seeped into one’s bones, Qing Shui’s heart ached for her. Even if it were another man in his shoes, he would probably feel exactly the same. Not only those who had a physical relationship would feel the heartache. Merely looking at that desolate back view would cause one’s heart to ache.</p>
  <p>As if she had heard the sound of footsteps, Shi Qingzhuang slowly turned around. The cool and beautiful face entered Qing Shui’s vision, remaining as cool and beautiful as ever, and as elegant as before. That coolness of the beauty coupled with the crimson-feathered clothes presented a deadly enchantment.</p>
  <p>Seeing Qing Shui, a tinge of surprise flashed past her cool countenance. “Qing Shui?”</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui heard the doubtful tone, he was almost knocked off his feet. Were it not that he knew from the previous event that it was her first time, he would really hold some suspicion about what kind of woman she was. He had taken her first time. Could she not recognize him when it had not even been half a year yet?</p>
  <p>He recalled the few encounters which they had previously. While she was cool, she was not hard to get along with. Her occasional smile was also an overwhelming beauty of a generation!</p>
  <p>“Mmm, the name seems right. Have you been fine?” Qing Shui felt bitter. The feeling of such a setback was really not fantastic.</p>
  <p>“I’m alright. Why are you here? To look for me?” Shi Qingzhuang’s expression faltered a little after seeing Qing Shui. This made Qing Shui feel a bit better, since it showed that she still remembered him.</p>
  <p>“That’s right. I just met your granddad, and came to take a look for you with his consent!”</p>
  <p>“Ahh!” Shi Qingzhuang had a slight shock.</p>
  <p>“Qingzhuang, I’ve missed you!” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
  <p>“Ahh, don’t say it!” Shi Qingzhuang’s gaze turned away slightly in a panic as she spoke.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw that other than panic, there were still many other elements in Shi Qingzhuang’s gaze. Could it be that this lass has some other predicaments or difficulties?</p>
  <p>“I came for a marriage proposal today!”</p>

 <p>He recalled the few encounters which they had previously. While she was cool, she was not hard to get along with. Her occasional smile was also an overwhelming beauty of a generation!</p>
 <p>“Mmm, the name seems right. Have you been fine?” Qing Shui felt bitter. The feeling of such a setback was really not fantastic.</p>
 <p>“I’m alright. Why are you here? To look for me?” Shi Qingzhuang’s expression faltered a little after seeing Qing Shui. This made Qing Shui feel a bit better, since it showed that she still remembered him.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. I just met your granddad, and came to take a look for you with his consent!”</p>
 <p>“Ahh!” Shi Qingzhuang had a slight shock.</p>
 <p>“Qingzhuang, I’ve missed you!” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>“Ahh, don’t say it!” Shi Qingzhuang’s gaze turned away slightly in a panic as she spoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that other than panic, there were still many other elements in Shi Qingzhuang’s gaze. Could it be that this lass has some other predicaments or difficulties?</p>
 <p>“I came for a marriage proposal today!”</p>
