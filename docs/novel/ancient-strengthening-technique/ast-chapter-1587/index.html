 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though rules are rules, sometimes there would be exceptions. This world consisted of five elements, but there were some things which belonged to none of these five elements. Some even belonged to more than one element.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having more than one element was like a double-edged sword. The more elements one had, the more elements would counter him. &nbsp;At the same time, he would also counter more elements, provided he was strong enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, no matter how much elemental advantage an elementary level warrior had, he could never win against a Martial King. This was a gap in power, a boundary which could never be crossed. Having an elemental advantage could only overturn situations where both sides were equal in strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was how the world worked. Everything had something it was weak against and something it was strong against. Only a few people managed to transcend this rule.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui noticed the lost expression on the Yasha Leader's face, but he quickly recovered. He did not say much after that, and quietly returned to his tribe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Clam-men leader did not kill his opponent, he managed to restrain him, which was his main objective. His power had always been on par with the Yasha Leader. Previously, he had noticed the Yasha leader's expression and speculated that there was someone strong supporting him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was almost sure that Qing Shui was that person. There was something unpredictable about the mysterious Sea King Palace’s Guardian. He had managed to impress everyone the last time he showed his powers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Muyun Qingge said, there were many Aquatics who were loyal to the Sea King's Palace. This was to be expected; people would always aim high. Only idiots would pledge loyalty blindly, but Qing Shui hoped that people would stick to their own principles even when facing more powerful forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything Qing Shui had done was to maintain the power of the Sea King's Palace and trying to prevent some people from leaving. As long as Qing Shui was here, he would eliminate anyone going against the Sea King's Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was smart. Naturally she had figured it out. She was slightly touched, but the fact that this very man had seen and touched her body made her feel weird.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That incident just happened under some special circumstances, so there was not much to say. Even though he was her saviour, it felt uncomfortable to have her naked body seen and touched by a mere friend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only reason she agreed was because she knew back then that she was going to die soon. Moreover, it did not seem like she could have prevented the incident given the situation. This made Muyun Qingge frustrated and, for some reason, uneasy as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange also seemed to notice something going on between the two, but she stayed quiet. Some things needed time. Outside interference would only disrupt the rhythm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What else could happen between a man and woman, other than that... Yiye Jiange only shook her head. This was to be expected when getting involved with such a man. There was nothing strange about other people falling for him, since she herself had also fallen already.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a merry mood all over the Sea King's Palace. Everyone had witnessed the Hundred Slayers Regiment’s strength. Furthermore, the Sea King's Palace was going to assemble more teams in the future like this. Anyone who had the ability and was capable had a chance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This filled the men with fervor. Everyone wanted to become stronger because in this continent, power meant everything. Being a part of a group like the Hundred Slayers Regiment meant that they would not have to worry about pills and battle strategies anymore. Plus, they would be able to learn formations too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, on the other hand, decided to take a look around. He went somewhere near the Sunset Palace's camp alone. It was quite reckless of him to do so, but he wanted to witness how strong his opponents were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The underwater tent he saw in the distance was something special. It was made out of a material that could ward off water. The material was thin but sturdy and was mostly resistant to undercurrents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was still quite some distance away, two figures appeared from the water. By now, Qing Shui was already familiar with most of the tribes of the Aquatics and he could tell that the two were Aquatic snakemen. These people resembled humans, but they would still retain some of their original forms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Aquatic Snakemen were in fact, Snakewomen. They had stunning snake-like waists, even more alluring than those of human women. Qing Shui still preferred human women.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two women had cold eyes, just like those of a snake. Those eyes somehow ruined their beautiful complexions, giving off an unappetizing feeling, as if one was being glared at by a venomous viper.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Whoever you are, turn back now!" One of them said to Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This should be the Sea King's Palace territory, right? Who says I can't be here?" Qing Shui said with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It doesn't matter whose territory this is. You are not allowed to be here." The woman glared at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sized up the woman speaking to him. She did not seem to be old, maybe around 30 years old. She was still young and had a more attractive figure than the other woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I would like to speak with the master of the Sunset Palace. Pass this on to him." Qing Shui said in a serious tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Speak with our Palace Lord? She's not someone you can speak with whenever you please." The woman said, still glaring with those cold eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tell me. What positions do you two hold? Don’t make me beat you into a pulp. I think it would be wise to report to higher ups when there is something you can't handle." Qing Shui replied. He was not angry, but wanted to make the opponent think that he was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How arrogant! Let's fight to teach you a lesson." The other woman said all of a sudden. Her voice was not as cold as the former, but was clearer. She seemed to be younger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui said nothing and chuckled. With a flicker, he disappeared and appeared right in front of the two women. He slowly raised his hands, clasping his hands on their throats. His movements seemed slow, but the two were not able to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any other thoughts, he calmly said, "Now do you believe me?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was instinctual for demons to bow down to stronger opponents. To them, it was not an act of shame, but one of survival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, I believe you. I'll go and report if you'd just let go of me." The older woman spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui loosened his grip. He never intended to take their lives either. He just felt like seeing how things played out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cough...cough......&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The women tried to regain their breaths and stared at Qing Shui with animosity, reminding Qing Shui not to leave before disappearing into the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not have any intention to follow them anyways. But he knew that he would not get to meet the Palace Lord that easily.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who's causing all the ruckus here? Don’t you know this is the Sunset Palace?" They started the intimidation right off the bat. It seemed like the Sunset Palace had quite the reputation here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Too bad they were dealing with Qing Shui. It was time to settle things once and for all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sized up the Apeman. He was around 3 meters high and still retained some ape-like features on his face, but he was already considered a humanoid or an intelligent type of animal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These tribes did not undergo Form Transformation, as they still retained some of their animal features. Unlike Muyun Qingge, who could be considered completely human, there were few tribes who could really undergo a Form Transformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The only thing I know is that this is the territory of the Sea King's Palace. I sent you to bring your Palace Lord, but you brought me an ape instead?" said Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Aquatic Apeman became agitated upon hearing Qing Shui's words. He absolutely hated being called an ape, but he managed to contain his anger. He stared at Qing Shui with his reddened eyes, "You have to prove yourself worthy before seeing our Palace Lord. Die!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Apeman lunged towards Qing Shui. He was several times larger than Qing Shui. With just one leap, he was already looming above Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back Connecting Fist!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not dodge it. Instead, he used Force Thrusting Back Connection and launched his counterattack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's mastery of the Back Connecting Fist was deep. His arms seemed to extend and landed right on the Apeman's fists. There were the sounds of bones cracking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Apeman was sent flying and coughed up some blood. He stared at Qing Shui in disbelief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How did you learn our Divine Ape Technique..."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aquatic Apeman mainly relied on the strength in their arms. They also cultivated the Back Connecting Fist; this was the fist technique passed down by most Ape tribes, but Qing Shui's Back Connecting Fist was different, yet stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood immediately. To be called a Divine Ape Technique, this technique must be very precious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other soldiers rushed into battle, but the Apeman stopped them. He turned towards Qing Shui and asked, "You seriously want to meet with our Palace Lord?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes. I wonder if this time, my message could be passed to the Palace Lord." Now, Qing Shui was confident that he would be able to meet the Palace Lord of Sunset Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll go report to the Palace Lord, but I cannot guarantee your meeting," the Apeman replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tell her that the Guardian of the Sea King's Palace wishes to see her." Said Qing Shui. Since he had already started a ruckus, he might as well reveal his identity as a Guardian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the Apeman returned very quickly. "The Palace Lord says you're welcome to enter, if you have the guts. She will be waiting in the middle tent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I accept. Lead the way please." Qing Shui replied courteously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Apeman nodded and began to lead the way.</span></p>
