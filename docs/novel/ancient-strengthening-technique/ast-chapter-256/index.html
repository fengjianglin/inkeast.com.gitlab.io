  <p><strong>AST 256 – Celestial Body Jade Bones (Canghai Mingyue), a Bangle that Enhances Destruction</strong></p>
  <p>“Can you hug me? Please… hug me like you hug your wife!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui also knew that she was afraid that she couldn’t escape the calamity this time around. She didn’t wish for her feelings to disappear into thin air so she wanted a heartwarming, unforgettable hug.</p>
  <p>“Lass, you have to be a little more gentle when you say these words. If not, there wouldn’t be any men who would dare to hug you.” Qing Shui extended his hands, going past the willow-like waist of Canghai Mingyue as he pressed her soft body into a tight embrace.</p>
  <p>This was the first time Qing Shui hugged her. The instant he came into direct contact with her, he could feel Canghai Mingyue trembling involuntarily. Qing Shui intentionally suppressed his desires, trying hard to not feel her twin peaks pressing into his chest. However, to his dismay, his rod of fire underneath became erect, pressing conspicuously on her stomach.</p>
  <p>“En!” Canghai Mingyue couldn’t bear it anymore as she let out a gasp. Her body squirmed, causing her soft, bouncy twin peaks to rub about on Qing Shui’s chest!</p>
  <p>That heavenly feeling caused Qing Shui to involuntarily press Canghai Mingyue into his embrace with even more strength, holding her tightly as he lost himself in the heavenly feeling and fragrance of Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue didn’t push Qing Shui away. She slowly yielded and rested her head on Qing Shui’s shoulders. Her panting gently blew on Qing Shui’s neck, causing his heart to be filled with an unbearable itch.</p>
  <p>Just like that, Qing Shui held her in his arms as his rod of fire dishonestly humped every now and then, but he didn’t do anything too drastic. Qing Shui wanted to give her a beautiful memory- he knew that Canghai Mingyue definitely did not want to do the deed with him right now.</p>
  <p>“Do you want to come my room tonight? We will finish this tonight.” Qing Shui whispered as he gently sucked on Canghai Mingyue’s earlobes.</p>
  <p>“No!! Don’t do it!” Canghai Mingyue’s body trembled.</p>
  <p>And in the span of a few breaths of time, Canghai Mingyue inclined her head as she smiled, gently pushing Qing Shui away while pulling Huoyun Liu-Li into the embrace of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Liu-li, I shall return him to you.” After she finished speaking, Canghai Mingyue walked away.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui almost couldn’t control himself. He wanted to grab at the buttocks of this woman and heavily smack it. However, at this moment, he had another peerless beauty in his arms.</p>
  <p>“This woman… what… she’s treating me like a item to be bartered.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui then tightly embraced Huoyun Liu-Li, thinking back to that time when she had teased him. It was now finally his turn to take revenge. Gazing at Huoyun Liu-Li at this moment, she seemed like a bashful wife, and didn’t dare to match her gaze with him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui extended his finger, propping up the delicate chin of Huoyun Liu-Li as a shameless light shone in his eyes. “You are so beautiful, just like a demoness.” Pressing her tighter into his embrace, his hands started to roam about and squeezing her perky butt. Despite her struggle, Qing Shui didn’t loosen his hold, but held on tighter, only releasing her after several moments.</p>
  <p>After he returned to his room, Qing Shui locked his door, breathing heavily, trying to suppress the fire in his heart. Hugging two beautiful women and not having a fantasy was a completely impossible task. The first thing humans learnt was self-control. If not, they could only be humans of the lowest grade. Those at the lowest grade had no need for self control because they had no influential power.</p>
  <p>Casting aside all his thoughts of distraction, Qing Shui entered into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>After practicing the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he began to immerse himself in forging. After the boots, he had already prepared the golden scales of the snake king, wanting to forge a set of armor for Canghai.</p>
  <p>Increase of speed by 10%, strength by 30, agility by 30, endurance by 10!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was extremely joyful. This finished product shared the same attribute enhancements with one of his earlier boots, although not with the golden-colored one that he had forged for Canghai.</p>
  <p>“Was the frame the problem? The frame of his and Canghai’s boots were forged from the 1,000 year-old coldsteel while the frame of the boots of Canghai’s wife was forged from a Grade 10 Tempered Metallic Essence.</p>
  <p>The quality of the materials had a huge impact on the end product. As a result, Qing Shui was buying all the rare and exotic materials at any cost.</p>
  <p>Bangle!</p>
  <p>At this moment, after the armor was completed, Qing Shui decided to forge a Bangle.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t know the usage of the Bangle, but by following the blueprints, Qing Shui used up all the remaining Grade 10 Tempered Metallic Essence. After the Smelting Synthesis, the materials should be enough for five sets of Bangles.</p>
  <p>Although a Bangle was quite small in size, it still required a significant amount of time to forge it. Even now, Qing Shui didn’t know what the effects or enhancements that the finished product would have.</p>
  <p>For weapons, the main attributes were endurance and agility. With these enhancements, one’s power would naturally skyrocket. As for armor, the main attribute was defense, while for boots, it was speed…</p>
  <p>From his various experiments, Qing Shui deduced that these should be the only attributes that could be enhanced, but he wondered why there weren’t any enhancements to attributes like magic power and physique.</p>
  <p>Physique was something akin to vitality, while magic power referred to the strength of mental power and spirit. Qing Shui deduced that the reason might be because his level of expertise wasn’t high enough yet.</p>
  <p>The thing Qing Shui was currently trying to forge was a Bangle using the Tempered Metallic Essence. The hammer blows during the forging process were the most important, but luckily for Qing Shui, his arms were infused with agility, and his proficiency had also risen several times since the time he first started. However, despite all these gains, his abilities were still very far from the apex.</p>
  <p>Following the diagram depicted in the blueprint, the silver clay was molded into shape, carved intricately, and refined with the qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>After countless refinements, a familiar light finally shone, causing Qing Shui to be tremendously happy. This was a brand new type of item forged!</p>
  <p>Destructive power +10%, strength +30, agility +20, endurance +20. Effects did not stack.</p>
  <p>Destructive power, Qing Shui trembled as he saw these words. Destructive power was even stronger than normal attack power. More importantly, it meant an increase in critical rate, a higher chance to deal critical damage. For example, if normally you can only break the bones of your opponent, with enhancement of destructive power, you could shatter their bones into fragments and even meld the effects of elemental properties like cold poison into your attacks.</p>
