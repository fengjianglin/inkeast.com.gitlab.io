  <p><strong>265 – Heavenly Palace’s Token, Second Level of Soulshake Bell</strong></p>
  <p>After finishing his sentence, Qing Shui leaned in to plant a kiss on those slightly pale, little lips!</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li struggled a little before she closed her eyes and gave in. She couldn’t stop the slight quivering of her delicate body!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gently kissed those delicate lips, sucking lightly, bumping, and tugging on them from time to time. Huoyun Liu-Li clenched her jaw tight.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not pry open her jaw as her body was very weak. He slowly raised his head, but his hand was still groping on her plump butt.</p>
  <p>That amazing sense of touch still made Qing Shui tremble a little; it had been a long while since he last tasted flesh. Qing Shui even felt a reaction from his nether region.</p>
  <p>He hurriedly let go of Huoyun Liu-Li gently and slowly. In addition to the crimson scar on her face, there was also a hint of a sick flush on her pale delicate face. It was an otherworldly charm in Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li felt a twinge of sweetness in her heart when she saw the infatuation in Qing Shui’s eyes. “He really likes me, I am sure that the look in his eyes is not lying to me.”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was a little less unsure now. Now that she had became like this, she thought: “If Qing Shui were to encounter the same accident as I did, I wouldn’t feel any different. But do women and men think the same way?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui helped Huoyun Liu-Li to slowly walk out. Somewhere not far behind them, Canghai Mingyue was happily looking at them.</p>
  <p>There was a faint smile on Huoyun Liu-Li’s face. Qing Shui felt particularly satisfied just from looking at her. He wasn’t sure why, but perhaps his happiness was because Huoyun Liu-Li was getting better.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, why were you so impulsive just now?” Huoyun Liu-Li gently asked, without the intention of reprimanding him.</p>
  <p>“Impulsive? Who said I was being impulsive? Liu-Li, if things didn’t turn out like this, I would still do the same. I would even take you to the bed because I am afraid of losing the chance to do it again in the future.” Qing Shui saw her struggle to walk, and a layer of sweat had already formed on her face. So, he just carried her in his arms!</p>
  <p>“Ah, don’t say such vulgar things!”</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, if all of us were to die tomorrow, would you regret?” Qing Shui embraced Huoyun Liu-Li. Her slender body was unusually lithe and graceful; it felt nice to embrace her.</p>
  <p>She was well developed. Aside from that sexy collarbone and those hipbones, the other areas on her body were exquisitely thin, yet not to the extent of being bony. Her soft white breasts and buttocks were plump, yet not overly large. Their perkiness and elasticity were impressive.</p>
  <p>“I won’t regret. I would never regret. I am very content and happy. Thank you, Qing Shui!” Huoyun Liu-Li said cheerfully. The expression on her face was so beautiful that it was as if it could even conceal the scar on it.</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, I kiss you or you get kissed by me, pick one!” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
  <p>“I don’t…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui quickly lowered his head to cover those parted lips. His long tongue searched for Huoyun Liu-Li’s pink, delicate tongue. They chased and intertwined with each other. Sucking on her lips made him yearn for body fluid.</p>
  <p>It was Huoyun Liu-Li’s second time being kissed by Qing Shui. It was always a surprise attack. However, instead of nervousness, she only felt the palpitations of her heart this time. Her tongue and Qing Shui’s eventually competed with each other for dominance.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui held her like a princess, with his right hand lingering on her beautiful buttocks. The soft, numbing sensation made Qing Shui extremely excited, and made Huoyun Liu-Li quiver.</p>
  <p>Gradually, Huoyun Liu-Li was emitting soft moans Those electrifying soft moans were like a weeping song, caused by Qing Shui and for him alone to listen.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue stared at Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li kissing from the pavilion. She had always hoped that Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li would be together, and her wish was considered granted now that both of them grew another step closer to each other. But why did she feel like she had lost a piece of something from her heart?</p>
  <p>“I don’t like him that way…………” Canghai Mingyue muttered to herself!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui slightly parted himself from Huoyun Liu-Li, who was panting. Her lovely face was a tint of red. Those charming, sharp, narrow eyes slightly opened. Qing Shui saw her opening her eyes and closed the inch gap between them to gently kiss her lips.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li shyly closed her eyes again. Qing Shui would let go of those soft lips when she closed her eyes and then softly suck on her lips again when she opened her eyes.</p>
  <p>The distance between their eyes were so close. Huoyun Liu-Li’s long lashes were almost brushing against Qing Shui’s. When she blinked, her eyelids were as if they were a thin fan; it was extremely seductive.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li could no longer escape from Qing Shui, but her eyes were watery. Qing Shui was aggressively kissing her thin lips. His hand was not satisfied from just groping her plump butt- it had made its way to caressing her seductive butt crack.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue had a clear view, she didn’t want to watch such an unnerving scene, but she ended up watching unblinkingly at the romantic scene happening below from somewhere near a window on the second floor. She could even see the hand movements of Qing Shui’s clearly. Her heart beated fast, her face and ears turned red.</p>
  <p>She left the window in a panic when she suddenly saw Qing Shui looking at her with a small smile!</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, you’re wet….”</p>
  <p>“Bastard, don’t say anything else! Carry me back, I want to change,” Huoyun Liu-Li buried her face in Qing Shui’s chest. His thin clothes couldn’t block out Huoyun Liu-Li’s breath; it was tantalizing.</p>
  <p>Coincidentally Huoyun Liu-Li’s lips were touching on Qing Shui’s chest, she even wittingly or unwittingly rubbed on it with her lips. Perhaps she were feeling those perky nipples.</p>
  <p>There was no sight of Canghai Mingyue by the time they returned to upstairs. He smiled when he saw the door to her room that was tightly shut. He knew that she was inside. Qing Shui entered the bedroom with Huoyun Liu-Li in his arms and put her onto the bed.</p>
  <p>“Do you want me to help you get changed?” Qing Shui teased.</p>
  <p>“No need. I can walk myself. I want to change……..”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled wryly and walked out of the bedroom while touching his nose in Huoyun Liu-Li’s laughters.</p>
  <p>“Get some rest, I’m going down first!” Qing Shui gently said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui exited the living room after a reply was heard.</p>
  <p>After awhile of walking, he saw Canghai and his wife standing somewhere not far away, as if they were waiting for him. Both of them turned around when they heard Qing Shui’s approaching footsteps.</p>
  <p>“Senior!”</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, let’s have a discussion today. I am afraid that we won’t have any time after this.” Canghai said quietly.</p>
  <p>“I think I might have an idea on what you wanted to say,” Qing Shui said in resignation.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, maybe you will not be able to accept anything that we are about to tell you. But it has come to the point where I don’t want to deceive you. I can’t hide this time, so now I just hope that you can bring YueYue and Liu-Li to escape from here.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui remained silent.</p>
  <p>“You will understand our thinking when you are a parent in the future. All we wanted is to keep YueYue safe. What goes around comes around. This is an old score from 30 years ago,” Canghai smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p>“Escape? Senior, where can we even escape to if anything happens to you?” Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
  <p>Canghai pulled out a small purple gold token that was about two inches long and an inch wide from his chest. The word “Palace” was intricately carved in silver on it, its charming brilliance reflected in the eyes.</p>
  <p>“This is the Heavenly Palace’s Token. Take this and go to the Heavenly Palace!” Canghai passed the token to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Canghai’s wife smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Promise us you will take care of YueYue for the rest of your life, okay?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at her in slight confusion.</p>
  <p>“That girl likes you, but she hasn’t realized it. We hope that you can take care of her in our place until she realizes it. This might very well be Canghai and my wish.”</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui heard the words of this woman, he couldn’t help but remember Huoyun Liu-Li’s words. They were the same. Just that if it was from Huoyun Liu-Li, Qing Shui would just brush it off as a joke or thought that it was one of her jokes.</p>
  <p>For Canghai Mingyue’s mother to say the same thing, it must be the truth. After all, no one knows a daughter better than her own mother.</p>
  <p>It would be a lie to say that Qing Shui was not happy about it, but for the most part it was still a surprise to him. He would have never thought that Canghai Mingyue would be attracted to himself, because he believed that the type of guy that Canghai Mingyue liked would be someone like Canghai, or at least someone like that middle aged man in the purple robe.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that he was still not mature enough himself, while Canghai Mingyue was already a lady of unsurpassed beauty of a generation.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui couldn’t help but think of his own mother when he looked at Canghai and his wife. They had already done everything they could as parents to this point. A father’s love was indeed like the mountains and a mother’s love was even greater.</p>
  <p>“QIng Shui, take this. We believe our judgement, and even trust that you will take good care of YueYue,” Canghai stuffed the Token into Qing Shui’s hands.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that his heavy responsibility had became even more heavy the moment he took the Token. The entire life of Canghai Mingyue. Was this a responsibility that he could bear?</p>
  <p>Heavenly Palace was indeed the Heavenly Palace. Qing Shui thought about it and knew that the techniques that Canghai used that day were the Heavenly Thunder Slash and Cloud Mist Steps. Qing Shui realized that he himself already had a deep longing towards the Heavenly Palace, longing to join this great sect that had stood for and persisted over a few ten thousand years in this world of the nine continents.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was going to ask some questions about the Heavenly Palace but decided against it. He knew that Canghai must had some reasons behind that bitter smile. Moreover, there was not much time left to talk.</p>
  <p>“Ride on your Fire Bird by then; the Mutated Beast of Heaven and Earth has its own peculiarities!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui nodded helplessly. Life had too many choices to make, especially the daunting ones in which every choices always came with a heavy price to pay, even to the point of getting smashed into pieces.</p>
  <p>“Also, if necessary, knock YueYue out cold. Do anything necessary for you all to escape…”</p>
  <p>“Look at the battle between me and Old Blindee tomorrow. Prepare to run by the 50th technique. I will remind you again. Nuo Tong will open you all a path.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui listened attentively; anyone would!</p>
  <p>During night time, Qing Shui went to take a look at Huoyun Liu-Li again. Right now she felt the burden on her shoulders was very, very heavy. Even though they were going to run away, will their opponent let them go? Even if they were to run, they would still need to get rid of Old Blindee, otherwise how would they be able to escape.</p>
  <p>By the time Qing Shui returned to his quarters, it was already the time to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. After entering, Qing Shui took the Golden Ringed Battle Armor, boots, helmet, bracelet, Coldsteel Needle, Soulshake Bell…</p>
  <p>“Oh, Soulshake Bell!” Qing Shui grabbed the small enchanted purple colored bell. The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique refined it once more and there was a burst of blinding light.</p>
  <p>“Seems like God didn’t push him to the dead end!” Qing Shui looked at the Soulshake Bell excitedly.</p>
  <p>Soulshake Bell, Second Level, had a high chance in driving target beasts within a radius of 300 meters into a state of frenzy. They will not differentiate between friends and foes, and crazily attack everything around them.</p>

 <p>Gradually, Huoyun Liu-Li was emitting soft moans Those electrifying soft moans were like a weeping song, caused by Qing Shui and for him alone to listen.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue stared at Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li kissing from the pavilion. She had always hoped that Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li would be together, and her wish was considered granted now that both of them grew another step closer to each other. But why did she feel like she had lost a piece of something from her heart?</p>
 <p>“I don’t like him that way…………” Canghai Mingyue muttered to herself!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slightly parted himself from Huoyun Liu-Li, who was panting. Her lovely face was a tint of red. Those charming, sharp, narrow eyes slightly opened. Qing Shui saw her opening her eyes and closed the inch gap between them to gently kiss her lips.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li shyly closed her eyes again. Qing Shui would let go of those soft lips when she closed her eyes and then softly suck on her lips again when she opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>The distance between their eyes were so close. Huoyun Liu-Li’s long lashes were almost brushing against Qing Shui’s. When she blinked, her eyelids were as if they were a thin fan; it was extremely seductive.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li could no longer escape from Qing Shui, but her eyes were watery. Qing Shui was aggressively kissing her thin lips. His hand was not satisfied from just groping her plump butt- it had made its way to caressing her seductive butt crack.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue had a clear view, she didn’t want to watch such an unnerving scene, but she ended up watching unblinkingly at the romantic scene happening below from somewhere near a window on the second floor. She could even see the hand movements of Qing Shui’s clearly. Her heart beated fast, her face and ears turned red.</p>
 <p>She left the window in a panic when she suddenly saw Qing Shui looking at her with a small smile!</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, you’re wet….”</p>
 <p>“Bastard, don’t say anything else! Carry me back, I want to change,” Huoyun Liu-Li buried her face in Qing Shui’s chest. His thin clothes couldn’t block out Huoyun Liu-Li’s breath; it was tantalizing.</p>
 <p>Coincidentally Huoyun Liu-Li’s lips were touching on Qing Shui’s chest, she even wittingly or unwittingly rubbed on it with her lips. Perhaps she were feeling those perky nipples.</p>
 <p>There was no sight of Canghai Mingyue by the time they returned to upstairs. He smiled when he saw the door to her room that was tightly shut. He knew that she was inside. Qing Shui entered the bedroom with Huoyun Liu-Li in his arms and put her onto the bed.</p>
 <p>“Do you want me to help you get changed?” Qing Shui teased.</p>
 <p>“No need. I can walk myself. I want to change……..”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled wryly and walked out of the bedroom while touching his nose in Huoyun Liu-Li’s laughters.</p>
 <p>“Get some rest, I’m going down first!” Qing Shui gently said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui exited the living room after a reply was heard.</p>
 <p>After awhile of walking, he saw Canghai and his wife standing somewhere not far away, as if they were waiting for him. Both of them turned around when they heard Qing Shui’s approaching footsteps.</p>
 <p>“Senior!”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, let’s have a discussion today. I am afraid that we won’t have any time after this.” Canghai said quietly.</p>
 <p>“I think I might have an idea on what you wanted to say,” Qing Shui said in resignation.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, maybe you will not be able to accept anything that we are about to tell you. But it has come to the point where I don’t want to deceive you. I can’t hide this time, so now I just hope that you can bring YueYue and Liu-Li to escape from here.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained silent.</p>
 <p>“You will understand our thinking when you are a parent in the future. All we wanted is to keep YueYue safe. What goes around comes around. This is an old score from 30 years ago,” Canghai smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>“Escape? Senior, where can we even escape to if anything happens to you?” Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>Canghai pulled out a small purple gold token that was about two inches long and an inch wide from his chest. The word “Palace” was intricately carved in silver on it, its charming brilliance reflected in the eyes.</p>
 <p>“This is the Heavenly Palace’s Token. Take this and go to the Heavenly Palace!” Canghai passed the token to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Canghai’s wife smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Promise us you will take care of YueYue for the rest of your life, okay?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at her in slight confusion.</p>
 <p>“That girl likes you, but she hasn’t realized it. We hope that you can take care of her in our place until she realizes it. This might very well be Canghai and my wish.”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui heard the words of this woman, he couldn’t help but remember Huoyun Liu-Li’s words. They were the same. Just that if it was from Huoyun Liu-Li, Qing Shui would just brush it off as a joke or thought that it was one of her jokes.</p>
 <p>For Canghai Mingyue’s mother to say the same thing, it must be the truth. After all, no one knows a daughter better than her own mother.</p>
 <p>It would be a lie to say that Qing Shui was not happy about it, but for the most part it was still a surprise to him. He would have never thought that Canghai Mingyue would be attracted to himself, because he believed that the type of guy that Canghai Mingyue liked would be someone like Canghai, or at least someone like that middle aged man in the purple robe.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he was still not mature enough himself, while Canghai Mingyue was already a lady of unsurpassed beauty of a generation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t help but think of his own mother when he looked at Canghai and his wife. They had already done everything they could as parents to this point. A father’s love was indeed like the mountains and a mother’s love was even greater.</p>
 <p>“QIng Shui, take this. We believe our judgement, and even trust that you will take good care of YueYue,” Canghai stuffed the Token into Qing Shui’s hands.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that his heavy responsibility had became even more heavy the moment he took the Token. The entire life of Canghai Mingyue. Was this a responsibility that he could bear?</p>
 <p>Heavenly Palace was indeed the Heavenly Palace. Qing Shui thought about it and knew that the techniques that Canghai used that day were the Heavenly Thunder Slash and Cloud Mist Steps. Qing Shui realized that he himself already had a deep longing towards the Heavenly Palace, longing to join this great sect that had stood for and persisted over a few ten thousand years in this world of the nine continents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was going to ask some questions about the Heavenly Palace but decided against it. He knew that Canghai must had some reasons behind that bitter smile. Moreover, there was not much time left to talk.</p>
 <p>“Ride on your Fire Bird by then; the Mutated Beast of Heaven and Earth has its own peculiarities!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded helplessly. Life had too many choices to make, especially the daunting ones in which every choices always came with a heavy price to pay, even to the point of getting smashed into pieces.</p>
 <p>“Also, if necessary, knock YueYue out cold. Do anything necessary for you all to escape…”</p>
 <p>“Look at the battle between me and Old Blindee tomorrow. Prepare to run by the 50th technique. I will remind you again. Nuo Tong will open you all a path.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui listened attentively; anyone would!</p>
 <p>During night time, Qing Shui went to take a look at Huoyun Liu-Li again. Right now she felt the burden on her shoulders was very, very heavy. Even though they were going to run away, will their opponent let them go? Even if they were to run, they would still need to get rid of Old Blindee, otherwise how would they be able to escape.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui returned to his quarters, it was already the time to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. After entering, Qing Shui took the Golden Ringed Battle Armor, boots, helmet, bracelet, Coldsteel Needle, Soulshake Bell…</p>
 <p>“Oh, Soulshake Bell!” Qing Shui grabbed the small enchanted purple colored bell. The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique refined it once more and there was a burst of blinding light.</p>
 <p>“Seems like God didn’t push him to the dead end!” Qing Shui looked at the Soulshake Bell excitedly.</p>
 <p>Soulshake Bell, Second Level, had a high chance in driving target beasts within a radius of 300 meters into a state of frenzy. They will not differentiate between friends and foes, and crazily attack everything around them.</p>
