 <p><strong>AST 1080 - Undergoing a Complete Change, Tidal Cloud Waves Seal</strong></p>
 <p>Although the Big Dipper Sword didn't increase his spirit energy like it did before, Qing Shui felt that his strength had increased qualitatively and that was enough. Sometimes, too much wasn't a good thing and he felt that the current status was good.</p>
 <p>The loss of the Big Dipper Sword's effect could be due to the readjustment of his body or that his body was unable to take it. It could be that in the future, if his power settled down, the effect of the Big Dipper Sword would reappear.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Qing Shui decided to not think too much. Nonetheless, he continued to enter his consciousness to check out that will.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain was controlled through will. It could be big or small and it could be used to stop the opponent's attacks, including spirit energy attacks. It could also be used to attack and the Nine Continents Mountain which was heavier than ten thousand jun [1] had the power of a Shield Attack. It could crush and push back opponents.</p>
 <p>Right now, it could attack with two times his strength and two times his speed. Its attack would have the power of a Shield Attack. It was activated by spirit energy and intent, additionally, it would deplete one's spirit energy!</p>
 <p>Could be leveled up!</p>
 <p>Could attack and defend!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain's spiritual Qi completely let Qing Shui's body undergo a complete change. That moment of darkness and blurriness from earlier had allowed the Nine Continents Mountain to enter his body and allowed him to go through a complete transformation.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the setting sun in the west, he was stunned. He had could recall clearly that it was morning earlier but it was now evening...</p>
 <p>This meant that the one moment he had felt earlier was actually about half a day!</p>
 <p>Located in his upper Dantian, the translucent Crimson Pellet in his Niwan Palace was the size of a marble. The spirit energy it contained even made Qing Shui feel that it was unbelievable.</p>
 <p>The Central Palace Blood Essence Pool, his entire body's blood, bones, muscles, and such had all went through a transformation. It was like his cells had gathered together and restructured themselves. The power contained in the Nine Continents Mountain was too great and powerful, causing Qing Shui's transformation to be much more powerful that if he were to experience an epiphany.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain could be leveled up. This was the power of Sacred Grade Heaven and Earth Spiritual Treasures. When Qing Shui used the Big Dipper Sword, he could reach a strength of close to 900,000 stars. After all, the 20% chance of his attacking prowess being doubled couldn't be considered his true strength. The weight of the Nine Continents Mountain was equivalent to twice his strength and it could also reach two times his speed. Speed was equivalent to power and as long as it was fast enough, even a falling leaf could inflict damage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shu had felt that his speed was quite good, and most importantly, the Nine Continents Mountain could still level up. With it doubling his strength and speed, its prowess was still quite terrifying.</p>
 <p>A strength of 1.7 million Stars and two times his speed... This was good enough, this was sufficient. Even when in the Ancient Ruins, he could crush the rest of the people. There would still be a restriction due to the world's regulations when in the Five Continents but Qing Shui's Great Golden Buddha Palm and other secret techniques were sufficient for him to be formidable.</p>
 <p>Sacred Grade Heaven and Earth Spiritual Objects were powerful enough and could level up. However, he didn't know if its strength would still increase after leveling up. Another thing was that while in the Dantian, the Nine Continents Mountain would be nourished by the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique all the time.</p>
 <p>Heart follows intent, rise!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't feel much and a small mountain about a hundred meters tall appeared before him. It was the image of the Nine Continents Mountain which was exuding a majestic power.</p>
 <p>Smash!</p>
 <p>With a move of his will, the Nine Continents Mountain which was like a small mountain plunged at a rapid speed.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>With a huge sound, a crater which was so deep that it was hard to see the bottom was created. The surroundings collapsed, burying even the Nine Continents Mountain underneath.</p>
 <p>Rise!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Rocks and dust flew about and the Nine Continents Mountain rose from the ground, bringing about an even greater crater. A huge sound rang out and even the grounds of the surroundings tremored.</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swung his hand. This was a habit of his but he could also use a slapping motion. If he were to use a slapping motion, it could increase the prowess of the Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain brought about an air current that was like a tornado. Wherever it passed, the rocks on the ground would be flipped up. Then it came to a stop after less than three hundred meters.</p>
 <p>There was a distance restriction to will control and two hundred to three hundred meters was still acceptable for Qing Shui. The Nine Continents Mountain was tempered by fresh blood and it was also being nourished in his Dantian. Therefore, there wasn't a need for him to temper it specifically.</p>
 <p>Feeling satisfied, Qing Shui headed back. He was still planning to keep the rest of the people from Lion King's Ridge here and he didn't have enough time to progress further. Otherwise, given that he had gained additional power, he had the abilities to press on.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>It was just starting to turn dark. Having become stronger, Qing Shui decided to catch some demonic beasts for himself. After all, he still had four bottles of low grade Sacred Beast Pills in his hands. The increase in his powers also made his spiritual sense acuter and he was able to sense a further distance away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out the Thunderous Beast and started to move around in the vicinity, searching for a powerful presence. After two hours, Qing Shui succeeded in finding one.</p>
 <p>Tiger Jiao Beast!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this demonic beast was about the same level as the Bloodhorn Silverhead Demon Ox. Qing Shui didn't wish to look for an even stronger one since there was a restriction to the low grade Sacred Beast Pills. While it might be fine for Wenren Wu-shuang, Qing Shui felt that it would be a little harder for his mother to manage a stronger beast with her cultivation level. Even if she could succeed, it would be just barely.</p>
 <p>The monster with a Jiao head and a Tiger’s body was snow-white in color and was a demonic beast with the ice attribute. It also came from a lineage of ancient beasts. Right now, it was easy for Qing Shui to deal with it given his powers, and he easily sealed it into his Demonic Beast Token.</p>
 <p>A strength of 100,000 Stars!</p>
 <p>A demonic beast like this should be able to unleash a power exceeding 30,000 Stars outside the ruins. Demonic beasts of their lineage had their own unique abilities, like how Yiye Jiange's Seven-Headed Crystal Beast could probably unleash a strength not lower than 150,000 Stars outside the ruins. However, when in the Ancient Ruins, it could only unleash a power of over 60,000 Stars.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Arhat Rosary Beads and Area Dominance. However, many demonic beasts had their own unique talents to go against the world's rules and let their own tribe better survive in this world.</p>
 <p>When it was about time, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He would need to start preparing things. He had mentioned earlier that he was going to make the people from Lion King's Ridge stay behind. Previously, he didn't have absolute confidence of winning, at least not in the Ancient Ruins. However, right now, he felt that it was not a problem.</p>
 <p>Once he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he saw that ‘book’ and was stunned. He had already forgotten about it when he had tossed into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Right now, it seemed that if he hadn't kept it in the realm, he might not be able to see it again. Something which could be placed together with the Nine Continents Mountain shouldn't be something that was that bad.</p>
 <p>Picking it up, the few words written on the covered entered Qing Shui's view.</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui flipped open the book doubtfully. This was a battle technique and there were not many pages. It was made from tempered beast hide and was very exquisite. He looked through it very quickly. After reading it, he closed his eyes and entered a state of deep thought.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already picked up the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm which focused on the Wave Essence. This Tidal Cloud Waves Seal was similar to the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, which focused on the Wave Force. As for their differences, he had decided to cultivate the skill and check it out for himself. He could also leave this for Qing Clan and let them treat this as a main battle technique for the clan.</p>
 <p>Since he still had a lot of time, Qing Shui decided to try and cultivate it. At the start, he only decided to casually pick it up since he felt that it was about the same as the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm and he didn't need to spend too much time on this. He might as well focus on his Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p>However, upon thinking that he had sufficient time and of how this Tidal Cloud Waves Seal was together with the Nine Continents Mountain, he thought that it shouldn't be bad. Obtaining too many skills was not a bad thing, and thus he decided to pick it up. It might even be useful for his cultivation of the Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p>This cultivation let Qing Shui discovered that no matter how similar battle techniques were, they would have their own unique traits. It was mentioned that the best way to pick up this Tidal Cloud Waves Seal was to look at the tides and the wave-like clouds in the sky.</p>
 <p>Seal Arts like the tides, like wave-like clouds!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't really understand that. After all, he had just started to pick it up. It was just that he didn't seem to feel anything. At Qing Shui's level, the harder the battle technique was to pick up, the more extraordinary it was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's determination and willpower could not be doubted. After one round of cultivation, it was about time for him to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This made him feel that he really needed to observe the tides and the wave-like clouds.</p>
 <p>Not wanting to rest, Qing Shui rushed back in the latter half of the night. Those demonic beasts who didn't know any better stood in his way and were all killed by him. Riding on his Thunderous Beast, he was invincible, causing havoc everywhere he went. This feeling was exhilarating and it had been a very long time since he had been doing things completely without restraints.</p>
 <p>Three days later!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps every day and after using the Nine Continents Steps four times, he would take a look around on his Thunderous Beast. He would also spend some time traveling. In the past few days, he had sealed two demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Mystic Wood Kirin and Golden Cauldron Spirit Crane!</p>
 <p>Their abilities were about the same as the one from before. The Golden Cauldron Spirit Crane wasn't only strong but its flying abilities were exceptionally strong. It could be considered a combination of a beast ride and a battle beast.</p>
 <p>Wuwu...</p>
 <p>A sharp cry rang out and Qing Shui lifted his head, looking into the distance. He had initially wanted to leave but after hearing a terrified cry, he decided to go and check it out. If it was someone he knew, he could lend them a helping hand. Therefore, he charged forth with the Thunderous Beast. Qing Shui had absolute confidence in his powers.</p>
 <p>This was a rocky terrain and from afar, Qing Shui could see hordes of demonic beasts both in the sky and on the land.</p>
 <p>Blood Wolf Vultures!</p>
 <p>After seeing this scene, Qing Shui frowned. He had been traveling for the past few days but the dangers in this place was a completely different level than the places he had been to before. Encountering a big group of Blood Wolf Vultures here was definitely deadly for many people. If he had encountered them when he first came, he would also be forced to run as well.</p>
 <p>There were no less than 100,000 huge blood red vulture bodies and black-colored wolf heads. They had covered the entire sky.</p>
 <p>Wolves' howls rang out loudly and Qing Shui could see that amidst the Blood Wolf Vultures, there were about over twenty people, most of them being old men. There were only two to three young men. When Qing Shui saw one of them, he laughed.</p>
 <p>That guy in violet-colored clothes was the person who had challenged him outside the Ancient Ruins.</p>
 <p>The people from the Violet Dragon Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that they had set up a formation and was trying to fend off the overwhelming numbers of Blood Wolf Vultures. Their formation was also very shaky, with fresh blood all over the place outside the formation. It seemed that there had been quite a number of casualties but considering that there were no corpses, they must have been devoured completely by the Blood Wolf Vultures to the extent that no bones or dregs were left behind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's appearance while riding the Thunderous Beast made them very happy.</p>
 <p>"Young Master, look, someone is here! Let's ask him for help!" An old man said agitatedly toward the man in violet-colored clothes.</p>
 <p>"Look at the demonic beast he is riding. It must be very strong. The fact that he dared to head over here must mean that he isn't scared of these Blood Wolf Vultures. Young Master, let's give it a try!" Another old man said quickly. At the verge of death, nothing else was of a concern.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Everyone looked at the Thunderous Beast which was closing in. When they saw that it was a young man, they were all astonished. However, the face of the man in violet clothes immediately turned pale. The same went for a few other old men. This was because when the man in violet clothes had issued the challenge, they were there too and thus could recognize Qing Shui.</p>
