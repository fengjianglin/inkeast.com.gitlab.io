 <p><strong>Chapter 293 The Legend-Tier Thousand Hammer Refinement Technique, Strife between the Nine Halls of the Heavenly Palace.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 293 - The Legend-Tier Thousand Hammer Refinement Technique, Strife between the Nine Halls of the Heavenly Palace</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya’s words caused Qing Shui to be immeasurably stunned, wasn’t that a 2-colored grade weapon?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui locked his gaze onto that raven black Heaven Shaking Hammer, and upon activating his heavenly vision technique, Qing Shui was extremely frightened when he saw the attributes of the weapon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>2-colored grade weapon, 20% increase in strength. +300 to strength!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at the attributes as his eyes bulged out. This heavenly hammer uses pure strength to obtain victory and was extremely tyrannical. 2-color graded weapons could actually enhance strength by 300, as the limits of 1-color graded weapons should only be able to enhance a certain attribute by 100+ or at the most, +200 to a certain attribute when one’s forging ability was at the peak of the 1-color graded weapon. Only when he broke through to 2,000 hammer strikes did he approach the acme of the 1-color graded weapon.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although the attributes were extremely shocking, the attributes of this hammer were too one sided as they only enhanced strength. Qing Shui had a feeling that the moment he steps into the 2-color graded weapons realm, he would be able to create even more astounding weapons with enhancement to four attributes instead of two.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, this heaven shaking hammer is for you. Originally, I prepared this as a birthday gift for my son that year, but sadly…” Cang Wuya passed the hammer to Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Old man, this is too valuable…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Haha, just accept it. Me and Wuji have already accepted you as one of our own. Anyway, you are adept at wielding the hammer. If you don’t accept it, don’t tell me it has no other use other than a </span><span style>an ornament that will decorate my coffin, accompanying me when I'm dead</span><span style>?” Cang Wuya shook his head and laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui hesitated, but eventually finally accepted. The weight of the hammer held no meaning to him, after all, the Big Dipper Sword was countless times heavier compared to this. However, the moment Qing Shui grabbed the hilt of the hammer, he felt a surge of strength rushing into his body... An increment of 20% in strength to Qing Shui equates to over a few tens of thousands of jin…</span></p>
  <p><span style>That +300 to strength equates to an increment of 3,000 jin. Although to him, this was like adding frost on snow, the miniscule increment was still better than nothing.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, is it convenient for you to execute your hammer arts?” Cang Wuya happily laughed. Qing Shui knew that Cang Wuya already treated him as his own son, that’s why he was so happy upon seeing Qing Shui holding on to the hammer he had prepared.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled as he agreed, lifting the hammer with his left hand, he unleashed the Thousand Hammers Refinement Technique projecting an air of majesty, profoundness, and tyranny. Maybe it was because of the enhancement in his strength, Qing Shui felt that the force of his hammer swings were many times stronger compared to the previous huge iron hammer he used. No wonder divine weapons were so sought after, not only had his strength and force increased, but it was only now that he could fully unleash the potential of the Thousand Hammer Refinement Technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Heaven Shaking Hammer, shaking the heavens with a single hammer. Aptly named, a hammer was originally the epitome of tyrannical weapons. Under the hands of Qing Shui, even a simple swing or chopping stance gave onlookers a feeling that he could tear mountains asunder. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li could only stare in awe and wonder as Qing Shui continued dancing about with the heaven shaking hammer. The imposing aura he emitted was extremely alluring, and the profoundness of his hammer strikes seemed to struck a chord with their hearts, causing them to wonder if this was a long lost legend-tier hammer technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Finishing his exertions, Qing Shui felt his whole body was extremely comfortable. When he finally put down the hammer and stared at the rest, he could only smile awkwardly in response when he noted their reactions.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Good, good, what a good hammer technique. This old man had seen and experienced &nbsp;many top experts using hammers before, but somehow the feeling you gave me was even more hegemonic compared to them. However, you are obviously inexperienced, your hammer strikes… they still lacked something. I believe that as long as you continue to work hard, the hammer in your hands in addition to your hammer technique, &nbsp;will soon become unrivaled in your generation.” Cang Wuya laughed gaily, as he felt truly happy in his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Old Master you are overly praising me, but thank you for this hammer!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hahaha, go, let’s go in. Everyone is here today, let’s go drink something inside and allow your Martial Elder Wuji to introduce and explain matters of the Heavenly Palace to all of you.” Cang Wuya smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Come everyone, let’s try out this ‘Amber Wine’ which I have kept for over 200 years!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya took out a huge vat of wine and poured out half a bowl for everyone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The translucent sparkling wine emitted a heavenly fragrance, causing waves of sweet drowsiness to overwhelm the senses of those who smelled it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Haha, Old Master is truly someone that knows how to appreciate good wine. Here, take this. This alcohol recipe was something that I prepared for senior Canghai, but he didn’t want to accept it. I shall pass this to you to show my gratitude then.” Qing Shui retrieved the recipe of the Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine and passed it over to Cang Wuya.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui secretly snuck glances at Canghai Mingyue. Although she would be hurt when she heard the name of Canghai, nothing could be done about it. Firstly in order to heal, she had to accept reality. Only with acceptance would the wound in her heart slowly close up, eventually recovering with time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya laughed as he accepted. Upon looking at the recipe, his eyes widened in wonder and shock. “Hai, to think that you have such a valuable alcohol recipe, this old man shall shamelessly accept it then.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Haha as long as Old Master is happy, Qing Shui is happy too. Thank you for everything!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words caused the smile on Cang Wuya’s face to be even wider. Cang Wuya nodded in a satisfied matter as he motioned to Fei Wuji, “This kid really knows how to please his elders.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fei Wuji’s only response was a twinkle in his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Martial uncle, can you tell us more about the internal situation of the Heavenly Palace? Me, Mingyue and Liu-Li, sometimes still feels like we are wading in the dark.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Fei Wuji smiled, as he slowly started, “Actually, not many people fully understand the truth of the matters and complex relations of the nine halls within our sect. If you fully understand the matters within one of the nine halls, you could already be considered very knowledgeable.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui thought about it, and understood that there was over millions of disciples in powerful sects like this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let me start from Starmoon Hall. Regardless, i’m still an elder of the hall, and my master is a supreme elder there.” Fei Wuji laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“During the time the Heavenly Place was founded, the founder had nine disciples, which eventually branched out to the nine halls you know now. However, one of the disciples was the son of the Heavenly Palace’s Old Man, and the other 8 disciples chose to allow the son to obtain the position of the Palace Lord of the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, and even vowed that neither they nor their descendants would never have any designs on the Lingxiao Treasure Hall. Not only that, but even the disciples they recruited would be first passed on to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall for selection.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>In this case, the power of the Lingxiao Treasure Hall should be the strongest?” Qing Shui asked, after the explanation of Fei Wuji.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Initially it was so, but after ten thousands of years, the eight other halls sprang out to contest the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, for the position of the Lord of the Heavenly Palace.” Fei Wuji sighed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm so what were the results?” Qing Shui was extremely interested. Such a story was very familiar to Qing Shui. No matter how good relations were between the previous generations, it was very hard to control the quarrels and internal struggles between members of the later generations. Time could diminish everything they worked for, and nothing could stand up to the test of time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe. Currently, although on the surface the Lingxiao Treasure Hall appears to be the strongest, they would only band together with the other halls in the case of an external threat. In times of peace, there will frequently be conflicts between them and the other halls. The Palace lord of the Lingxiao Treasure Hall is still an inherited position, passed down one by one throughout the generations”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Internal strife, Qing Shui’s emotions had no fluctuations even when he thought of these two words. There were too many cases of internal strife between father and son, or brothers against each other in his previous world. Especially for the royalty, so he was long since immune to it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Only the Lingxiao Treasure Hall still has the descendants of the original Heavenly Palace old man, the other positions of Palace Lord and Mistresses of the eight halls were all not inherited because of blood relations. Other than Starmoon Hall, Misty Hall, Constellation Hall, Starday Hall, they were all taken over by external members while the other four halls in addition to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall are still inherited via blood relations.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What about the level of power of each hall?” Qing Shui knew that each respective hall had their own secret skills and techniques, thus resulting in a difference in power levels.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The weakest are Starmoon Hall and Misty Hall, but I’m not very clear about the power levels of the others.” Fei Wuji bitterly laughed as he replied.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Cang Wuya laughed as he accepted. Upon looking at the recipe, his eyes widened in wonder and shock. “Hai, to think that you have such a valuable alcohol recipe, this old man shall shamelessly accept it then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha as long as Old Master is happy, Qing Shui is happy too. Thank you for everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words caused the smile on Cang Wuya’s face to be even wider. Cang Wuya nodded in a satisfied matter as he motioned to Fei Wuji, “This kid really knows how to please his elders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Wuji’s only response was a twinkle in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Martial uncle, can you tell us more about the internal situation of the Heavenly Palace? Me, Mingyue and Liu-Li, sometimes still feels like we are wading in the dark.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Wuji smiled, as he slowly started, “Actually, not many people fully understand the truth of the matters and complex relations of the nine halls within our sect. If you fully understand the matters within one of the nine halls, you could already be considered very knowledgeable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui thought about it, and understood that there was over millions of disciples in powerful sects like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me start from Starmoon Hall. Regardless, i’m still an elder of the hall, and my master is a supreme elder there.” Fei Wuji laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“During the time the Heavenly Place was founded, the founder had nine disciples, which eventually branched out to the nine halls you know now. However, one of the disciples was the son of the Heavenly Palace’s Old Man, and the other 8 disciples chose to allow the son to obtain the position of the Palace Lord of the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, and even vowed that neither they nor their descendants would never have any designs on the Lingxiao Treasure Hall. Not only that, but even the disciples they recruited would be first passed on to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall for selection.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this case, the power of the Lingxiao Treasure Hall should be the strongest?” Qing Shui asked, after the explanation of Fei Wuji.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Initially it was so, but after ten thousands of years, the eight other halls sprang out to contest the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, for the position of the Lord of the Heavenly Palace.” Fei Wuji sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm so what were the results?” Qing Shui was extremely interested. Such a story was very familiar to Qing Shui. No matter how good relations were between the previous generations, it was very hard to control the quarrels and internal struggles between members of the later generations. Time could diminish everything they worked for, and nothing could stand up to the test of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe. Currently, although on the surface the Lingxiao Treasure Hall appears to be the strongest, they would only band together with the other halls in the case of an external threat. In times of peace, there will frequently be conflicts between them and the other halls. The Palace lord of the Lingxiao Treasure Hall is still an inherited position, passed down one by one throughout the generations”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Internal strife, Qing Shui’s emotions had no fluctuations even when he thought of these two words. There were too many cases of internal strife between father and son, or brothers against each other in his previous world. Especially for the royalty, so he was long since immune to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only the Lingxiao Treasure Hall still has the descendants of the original Heavenly Palace old man, the other positions of Palace Lord and Mistresses of the eight halls were all not inherited because of blood relations. Other than Starmoon Hall, Misty Hall, Constellation Hall, Starday Hall, they were all taken over by external members while the other four halls in addition to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall are still inherited via blood relations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the level of power of each hall?” Qing Shui knew that each respective hall had their own secret skills and techniques, thus resulting in a difference in power levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The weakest are Starmoon Hall and Misty Hall, but I’m not very clear about the power levels of the others.” Fei Wuji bitterly laughed as he replied.</span></p>
