 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2407 - Helpless Qing Shui, Foolish Woman...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan. He really wanted to ask if what she was doing now had to do with things that she had wanted to do herself. However, thinking of how she didn't recognize him, who was he to ask about her like that? Moreover, the two of them were on different sides at the moment and everything she did was very normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're the sect leader of the Demon Gate here, right?" Qing Shui let himself calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is anything wrong?" asked Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui gave it some thought before he looked at her. He was puzzled. "How much of the past do you remember?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan didn't reply Qing Shui. She frowned, "What matters made you look for me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm asking you a question. How much of the past do you remember?" Qing Shui frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's voice was deep and a little cold, causing Tantai Lingyan to be stunned for a moment. No one had dared to speak to her like this; she wasn't used to it. Wearing a frown on her beautiful forehead, she said, "If there's nothing important, then I'm leaving. One more thing. Don't look for me in the future. I'll make a move against you next time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan's expression was very cold like a frozen ice statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled and looked at her. "I'm your man. Have you forgotten even this? Make a move against me? Have you forgotten that you pierced a sword through me last time? Look at how you've become now. In the past, you were very kind. How did you become like this?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan appeared aloof as she looked at Qing Shui. It was as if she were looking at a person who was completely unrelated to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was feeling very displeased and upset at the moment. It was like what they said... The furthest distance was when a woman was standing before you but didn't know that you loved her...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You've dealt serious injuries to the Divine Palace's Palace Lord. If it wasn't because I've treated him, he would’ve definitely died. Go on, tell me. What are you doing this for? I can help you achieve what you want." Qing Shui's voice sounded a little hoarse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's nothing strange for there to be injuries in a fight between the Demon Gate and the Divine Palace. Is it really something weird? What am I doing this for? How can there possibly be so many whys?" Tantai Lingyan seemed a little lost when asked for the reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's do this. We'll have a fight. If you were to lose, then return to my side and listen to me until you've recovered your memories. What do you think?" Qing Shui gave it some thought before saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You won't be able to win against me." Tantai Lingyan shook her head, exuding strong confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt very gloomy. This woman had lost all of her memories about the two of them. Not only did she not remember him, but she no longer remembered the people related to him, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How would we know without trying?" Qing Shui looked at her, trying to prod her into accepting his request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you're able to win against me, you'll naturally be able to kill me. Would you still have to go through so much trouble like this?" Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. I can do that. But you're my woman. No matter how bad you've become, I don't wish to hurt you. I have two Heartmatched Fruits here. In fact, everything will be fine as long as I let you eat this, but I feel that it’s unfair toward you. However, you've lost all memories about me and this doesn't seem to be fair toward me either."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui said this as he brought out the two Heartmatched Fruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heartmatched Fruits were Heavenly Fruits that didn't provide one with any additional abilities. Each time, the tree would produce two fruits. As long as a couple ate the two fruits together, they would fall in love and their love for each other would be never-changing. This was why this fruit was so precious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan looked at the fruits in Qing Shui's hands and looked at him. "I don't know if what you've said is real, I don't feel that I've lost my memories, nor do I want to know if what you've said is the truth or not. Moreover, I don't wish to fight or spar against you. I'm not interested in the condition you have raised either."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan who didn't seem to be able to accept anything he said. He rubbed his head and said outright, "At most, we'll start all over again. Right now, I'm going to start afresh. I'll definitely make you fall in love with me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan was stunned and she looked at Qing Shui with a strange expression. It was as if she suddenly recalled that she was a woman and that this man was trying to pursue her. She was a Demon Lord, the leader of Demon Kings. There hadn't been anyone who had tried to pursue her, nor had she ever thought about having a relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been like this in the past, but Qing Shui was an exception in her life. In the past, she had almost become no different from an ordinary woman. However, now that she had lost all her memories regarding Qing Shui, everything returned to how it had been.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then you can just continue to wait!" After saying that, Tantai Lingyan turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lingyan, the scenery here isn't bad and there aren't any outsiders here. It's been a long while since we've been intimate. Why don't we..." Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan with a teasing smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you trying to force me to kill you?" Tantai Lingyan said coldly to Qing Shui after hearing what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You don't believe that I'm the only man you've ever loved. If you were to kill me and then regained your memories one day, you'll commit suicide. Even after committing suicide, you might still not forgive yourself. If you don't believe me, you can ask Old Turtle. You should believe in what he says," &nbsp;Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If it wasn't because he had said something similar to me, do you think that you would be able to live until now?" Tantai Lingyan said outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, then it means you also believe that I'm your man." Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I do, but I've lost my memories. I don't like you nor do I recognize you. Right now, I'm no longer the same person I was in the past. Therefore, you shouldn't act like I am the same person you've known me to be. What do you think?" It was rare that Tantai Lingyan's tone had softened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan had made a big detour in her words, but Qing Shui understood what she meant. He said helplessly, "Then, can we be friends? After all, I've chased you for a few decades before you agreed to become mine. Don't you think that you're being too cruel to me like this?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're a Battle God and I'm a Demon Lord. How can we be friends?" Tantai Lingyan asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You were also a Demon King in the past, but you were very rational. Why have you become so foolish now? You're really a foolish woman," Qing Shui sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and tried her hardest to calm down. She had the urge to give him a beating. This was the first time that someone had said that she was a foolish woman...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm the Demon Gate's sect leader, and you lead a bunch of Battle Gods. Do you think it's possible for us to become friends?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There are no friendships that last forever, nor are there people who will forever be foes. Anything is possible. Why don't we call a truce for now? This is only the Middle Three Regions and there's still the Upper Three Regions. There are too many powerful forces in the Nine Continents, and the Demon Gate and Divine Palace are just two of them. Shall we fight after you've become the sect leader of the Nine Continents Demon Gate? Right now, both of us are insignificant characters so what's there for us to fight? It's really embarrassing. If those strong people were to see this, they'll definitely think that we're foolish, foolish woman.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're the foolish man! You're the one who's a great fool!" Tantai Lingyan shouted toward Qing Shui angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui saw Tantai Lingyan appear a little infuriated, he smiled and said happily, "You're really petty. You don't even know that I'm actually complimenting you. Women are cuter when they are foolish. Look at how you always carry a cold look on your face as if everyone owes you money. Who are you showing that long face to? Come on, lass, give me a smile."</span></p>
