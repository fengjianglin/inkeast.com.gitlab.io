 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our names seem to be quite similar, all with four words. Happy to meet you.” Yiye Jiange smiled at Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not tell the others about Tantai Lingyan, which was why few people knew about her existence. Also, Tantai Lingyan’s personality was rather reserved and she did not ask much, so she also did not know who was by Qing Shui’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like attracts like, and the same went for beauties. After all, with their level of beauty, they would not be envious of the others’ beauty. Their beauty had reached a pinnacle, and each of them had their own unique temperaments - they were all extremely beautiful in their own ways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan wisely knew that these two women were definitely not normal friends of Qing Shui. She did think that a man like him would definitely be surrounded by women. After all, this was not like the first time when they met. Actually, she didn’t know that, back then, Qing Shui already had many excellent people around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, happy to meet you too!” Tantai Lingyan didn’t smile, but she wore a natural and gentle expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiange, let’s try to find some time and I’ll bring you home. It’ll only take a couple of days. The little lass really misses you as do my mum and the rest as well.” Qing Shui smiled and tried to lighten the mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Knowing there was only a few days, even if they needed half a year to return, she still wanted to go back. After all, she and Qing Shui had broken through the last barrier in their relationship. so they could be considered husband and wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was thinking of exactly the same thing, wanting to go back with you as soon as possible, but I didn’t think that it’d be this soon.” Yiye Jiange thought Qing Shui could only use the Nine Continents Step. While that method was fast, it still required quite a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui brought Yiye Jiange back, he couldn’t use the husband and wife ability. He’s only able to go to Yehuang Country in the Phoenix Dance Continent and go to the Continent’s Capital from there. This way, they’d require only about a day using both the Five Elements Divine Flag and Nine Continents Step; on the other hand, coming back here was fast since they could immediately get here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Muyun Qingge felt that she was a bit of an outsider. She knew Yiye Jiange was Qing Shui’s woman and she felt this ice-cold woman was as well. A woman’s instinct was very strong after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he just arrived, Qing Shui could not immediately leave, which was why he decided to come here two days earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, you went back?” Yiye Jiange thought of him appearing here with someone else, and he also mentioned that everyone back home missed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“En, Luan Luan and your brother are all doing great, except that they miss you a little.” Qing Shui immediately said what Yiye Jiange wanted to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge have been staying here all this while in this hidden, but spacious place. The entrance was set up with a formation and the Spiritual Qi here was abundant so both the women could continue to live here in seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui unintentionally met Muyun Qingge’s gaze and she smiled nervously while he felt a little awkward. Although it was to heal her back then, seeing her body was something he could not undo. Moreover he had touched her body, even the most private areas had been seen and touched…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge initially did not feel like living and had no idea how to stop it. But unexpectedly, it had turned out this way and thereafter she always felt a little awkward with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge excitedly brought Tantai Lingyan to look for accommodation and Qing Shui did not accompany them, as he felt that it was not a bad thing for Tantai Lingyan to interact with Yiye Jiange a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it was because of Qing Shui, but the three women really got along. He felt a little odd. He saw Tantai Lingyan treating Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge like how she did with Hua Rumei, which bewildered him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not caring if he understood it or not, Qing Shui felt happy in his heart because he only hoped for his women to be harmonious among themselves. It was not necessary for them to be as close as sisters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at his women, there was certainly a trend. For example, Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liuli, Zhu Qing and Mingyue Gelou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not want to see it happening but he knew that with too many women, there would be a high chance of such things happening. Thankfully, he knew that excessive behavior would not happen because they were all capable women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the two days they were here, Qing Shui always slept alone at night. He had three unrivalled beauties, but he couldn’t touch any of them. Initially, he wanted to go to Yiye Jiange’s side but she did not allow him. These few women were all very strong. If Qing Shui went over, he would definitely be discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge knew Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange were husband and wife, but there was also Tantai Lingyan. If Yiye Jiange saw him but didn’t want him, he could only bear with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyway, there were going to be further opportunities, so Qing Shui decided to resist. To be able to see but not eat versus being unable to eat were two different things - he would be able to forgo touching a woman without a woman by his side, but if there were women by his side, to hold back even for one night was very difficult…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After two days, Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan bade farewell to Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge and left Ice Ocean Domain for Linhai City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are your wives.” Tantai Lingyan said to Qing Shui while on the journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yiye Jiange is my wife but Muyun Qingge is the Princess of Sea King Palace. Both of us are just normal friends.” Qing Shui hurriedly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan smiled - she smiled a lot more these days - and said: “They are very beautiful. You’re very lucky to have so many heavenly beauties for your wives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re also a heavenly beauty” Qing Shui earnestly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So am I prettier or is she prettier?” Tantai Lingyan grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words caused Qing Shui some astonishment as he didn’t expect this from her. But he frankly said: “Spring’s orchids and autumn’s chrysanthemums have their own merits. Everyone is beautiful in her own way so I really cannot see who is more beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t trying to placate or deceive her, but spoke the truth instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like you like Yiye Jiange a little more, since she’s gentler than I am.” Tantai Lingyan sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was also aware of her character - in fact she disliked her character a little. But she could not change and she felt that men would much prefer women like Yiye Jiange - beautiful with a disposition of the big sister next door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have a universal love for everyone, so I also like an icy-cold beauty like you.” Qing Shui firmly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

Lan Lingfeng was overjoyed to see Qing Shui return and both Hao Tian and Feng Xi felt the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hao Tian was able to walk like a normal person now, but he could not exert any of his strength. Moreover, he had lost more than half his strength, but he was very positive as his body was rid of that Ancient Poison Worm. If that thing had remained in his body, not only would his body not be able to bear all that pain, but also he would be under enormous mental pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui is back.” Feng Xi smiled after seeing him. She was worried that he wouldn’t come back this month, since any hopes of her husband recovering were pinned on Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aunt Feng, hope all of you are doing well!” Qing Shui greeted them with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding people did not ask anything after seeing Tantai Lingyan beside Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, this must be your wife. She’s really beautiful.” Feng Xi smiled at Tantai Lingyan and walked towards her while casually taking her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, Aunt Feng!” Tantai Lingyan greeted her. She was trying to change, and was also trying to change for Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui is my benefactor, and truth be told, I already treat him like family, as one of the younger generations.” Feng Xi warmly said. She meant this and was neither trying to establish connections nor overcompensate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She would give Qing Shui a reward. Whatever she had she’d surely give to him but the familiarity and closeness they shared was genuine. There’s no such thing as love or hate without rhyme or reason in this world and since Qing Shui had saved Hao Tian, it's normal to be on such close terms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To be under your care, Qing Shui should be very fortunate.” Tantai Lingyan already knew that this woman was part of the Divine Moon Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s actually me who’s fortunate.” She travelled to numerous places for over ten years but only Qing Shui was able to heal her husband. Love the crow if you love your house, so the woman treated everyone from the Imperial Cuisine Hall very well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked surprisingly at Tantai Lingyan. This woman had really changed compared to when she would previously close herself off from everyone else, without letting anyone else enter. Now, she seemed willing to come out of her shell, although she might not let anyone enter her heart so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi beamed at Tantai Lingyan and said: “I’m not sure why, but when I look at you I feel a special kind of feeling. How about becoming my goddaughter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi’s request caused Qing Shui to be mildly stunned. There were way too many surprises today, but what made him even more surprised was that Tantai Lingyan only hesitated for a moment before accepting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked on as she called out ‘Godmother’ out of respect and Feng Xi put on a necklace with precious stones as big as a baby’s fist for Tantai Lingyan. The necklace emitted a spiritual aura that let him know it was absolutely extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is fantastic. If anyone bullies you, you must tell godmother and I’ll stand up for you.” Feng Xi happily said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was really clueless right now, mainly because today’s incident happened to Tantai Lingyan, which was a little unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hao Tian was also at the side. Upon seeing his wife give Tantai Lingyan a present, he took out a golden rope and gave it to her. Qing Shui was shocked, with mouth agape, when he saw the rope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed like accepting Tantai Lingyan as their goddaughter wasn’t for them to get closer to Qing Shui, but Qing Shui felt that the golden rope was sufficient reward for what he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden Divine Rope!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was truly a treasure. Moreover, when Hao Tian gave it to her and told her to drip some blood for it to recognize its master, Qing Shui knew that this object would be very useful. Tantai Lingyan wanted to reject it but Feng Xi said: “Lass, I did not recognize you as my goddaughter with any ulterior motive. I meant what I said previously when I said that I had a feeling of kinship with you. I do not like you to be lonely and you and Qing Shui are one family now, so treat this house like yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan did not know why, but a sudden feeling overcame her and she immediately agreed. Perhaps it was really the kinship her godmother mentioned. Tantai Lingyan lightly nodded: “Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was elated and it was just as well. He actually knew that it was Feng Xi’s way of thanking him. She knew Tantai Lingyan was his wife and taking her as her goddaughter was a fortune not just anyone could receive.</span></p>
