 <p><strong>AST 579 - Luan Luan and Yuchang taken away, Four Seas Country vying for the Greencloud Continent (2)</strong></p>
 <p>With the speed of the Fire Bird, the journey would still require a little more than a day. Qing Shui did not know when they left. Even if they had only left half a day before Qing Shui, he did not know if the Fire Bird would be able to catch up to them, even if it flew at its maximum speed.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m afraid that you might encounter misfortune.. you better not go!” Yiye Jiange was still worried as she tugged on Qing Shui’s sleeves.</p>
 <p>“If I don’t go then are you going to go alone?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“Maybe they would not make things difficult for me when I get there……” Yiye Jiange was not confident.</p>
 <p>“If I don’t go and you go alone, then am I still human? Letting them bully you? Over my dead body!” Qing Shui said in a determined tone that no one could refute.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, if you are doing this to repay me for helping you back then, then everything you have done for Luan Luan is already sufficient.” Yiye Jiange looked peacefully into the distance.</p>
 <p>“When I receive kindness, I will repay it with even more kindness. Furthermore, back then, when I brought Luan Luan back, I was not aware of your relationship with Luan Luan. At that time, I had already intended to make sure the young lass would feel loved.” Qing Shui recalled the time he met Luan Luan, in particular, he was reliving the and treasuring that moment.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, can you treat me as though I am your friend? Although you already stopped addressing me as master, but the feeling still has not change.” Now that things had gotten this far, she did not hold anything back, nor did she want to hold anything back.</p>
 <p>“We have always been friends, extremely good friends. As friends, we should be able to help each other, it is the same for you and me. However, because of Luan Luan’s matter, you have been wronged.</p>
 <p>“I am very gratified and I do not feeling wronged at all!”</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui did not enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at night, nor did he rest. Qing Shui did not stop. After all, it would not be a problem for the Fire Bird to fly for a whole day and night. He would let it rest when they got to the Four Seas Country.</p>
 <p>The sky began to brighten. Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange had finally arrived at the Four Sea Country. At the Four Seas Country, there was a sea in each of the four directions of north, south, east, and west. Thus the country’s name, Four Seas Country.</p>
 <p>There was also a sea in the Four Seas Country’s capital, the Country’s Capital was quite close to the Continent's Capital. When they entered the city, Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange immediately looked for a beast carriage to bring them to the Hundred Clan War Barracks.</p>
 <p>What caused Qing Shui to be depressed was that the distance was too far. They could not get a beast carriage for it would take a long time. Without any other choice, Qing Shui asked for the directions and then flew with Yiye Jiange for two hours.</p>
 <p>This time, they were able to get a beast carriage and arrived at the Hundred Clan War Barracks, it was indeed the luxurious area of villas that was described to them when he asked for directions.</p>
 <p>In front of them was a huge area filled with villas, there were at least a few hundred of them. There was only one road leading there and the beast carriage could only bring them to the outside of a large villa.</p>
 <p>In front of the villas, there was a huge and wide door! There were two rows of guards standing there. At each side of the doors there were stone sculptures of lions and elephants, they were majestic and beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go inside and take a look, Luan Luan must have missed you.” Qing Shui smiled at Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“En!”</p>
 <p>“Halt, who goes there!” A middle-aged man leading the two rows of guards came out and blocked Qing Shui’s path.</p>
 <p>“I am from the Qing Clan, I have arrived!” Qing Shui released a suppressing air, against these people, he did not need to be polite. It was just that Luan Luan and Yuchang were still on their hands.</p>
 <p>“Hang o…...on!” The middle-aged man wearing armor turned around and ran inside, his forehead full of sweat. He felt like he was being watched by a huge beast and could be eaten anytime.</p>
 <p>Very soon, many people of all sorts of ages came out. There were both males and females. Qing Shui extend his Spiritual Sense, he knew that these were the people of the Hundred Clan War Barracks.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw them, he felt relieved in his heart.</p>
 <p>“They are too confident, since they actually lured him into their territory. Luan Luan and Yuchang are probably not in any trouble.” Qing Shui laughed when he saw they their cultivation were not high.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood there without moving. His gaze locked onto three old men within the crowd, they looked very old but they still had a strong life force.</p>
 <p>The old man in the middle had a well-proportioned body. He had long snow white hair that extended to his waist and a pair of eyes as cold as ice. His nose was straight and his lips were tightly pressed against each other.</p>
 <p>The surrounding people seemed to fear this gaze of the old man, a fear that seemed to encompass reverence. The two old men beside him seemed to be even older, but their vitality was still strong and sturdy.</p>
 <p>Three Martial Saints!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected that in a country like the Four Seas Country, they had hidden three Martial Saints. The old man in the middle should be the strong Martial Saint that Lin Zhanhan mentioned, Qing Shui felt that his strength was comparable to the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast.</p>
 <p>The two men beside him were relatively weaker, only about the same level as Elder Ge. At best, they were slightly stronger than Elder Ge.</p>
 <p>“How deep are the waters in the World of the Nine Continents?” Qing Shui shook his head. He discovered yet again that he had only seen the tip of the iceberg in the World of the Nine Continents. He remembered that in the tiny Hundred Miles City, there was a Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp that he did not know the strength of. However, Qing Shui was sure that it was at least a Martial Saint Beast.</p>
 <p>Of the two old men at the side, one wore a light blue gown and the other wore a black gown. The old man in the middle wore a golden silk shirt. They were slowly walking over.</p>
 <p>Behind the three old men, there were tens of other old men. Their strength were about the level of Heavenly Palace’s supreme elders, peak of Martial King. Their strengths were mostly between the strength of three countries to the strength of five countries. However, there were some exceptions with the strength of seven countries or eight countries. All this information was clearly gleaned by Qing Shui using his Spiritual Sense.</p>
 <p>This lineup was stronger than any sect that could be found in the Continent's Capital. If it were not for some reasons, they would have been the biggest clan in the Greencloud Continent, at least up until now. Their strength no longer threatened Qing Shui. It was a pity for them that their luck was bad, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had broken through and could easily suppress them.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, the younger generations will surpass us with time, you are Qing Shui?” The old man in the golden silk shirt smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Even though he was smiling, his cold gaze made it seem like an icy smile. In addition, Qing Shui felt that there was a deep disdain.</p>
 <p>“Where are the two young lasses? You are so old already, why do you enjoy using such despicable means?” Qing Shui stared at the eyes of the old men, giving them a spurious smile.</p>
 <p>The old men were stumped for words, they were obviously struck dumb by Qing Shui’s words. They had come to the Greencloud Continent for almost two hundred years already and no one had dared to speak to them like that. This young man was ridiculous.</p>
 <p>“Did you not see the note? The two naughty girls actually used their Demonic Beast to harm my people, was I wrong to capture them? The old man’s gaze turned even colder, becoming akin to a Demonic Beast addicted to killing people.</p>
 <p>“I don’t wish to speak any further, I am here to take them away. Everyone is well aware of what’s going on, is there a need to use such a horrible excuse? I want to see them.” Qing Shui coldly smiled at the old man.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange stood next to Qing Shui and did not say anything, but she still attracted a lot of gazes. Many people could tell that one of the girls they had brought back was very similar to her.</p>
 <p>“Grandfather, keep this woman behind……”</p>
 <p>“Shut up!” The old man interrupted the young voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s knife-like gaze now shifted to a fat youth standing behind. When that youth was gazed upon by Qing Shui, he directly took a few steps back. If there hadn’t been someone behind him, he would have fallen over.</p>
 <p>He no longer dared to meet Qing Shui’s gaze and he burst into cold sweat.</p>
 <p>“You are too reckless!” Qing Shui stared at the old man in the middle and casually said.</p>
 <p>The old man’s expression changed and he gave Qing Shui a death stare. A strong suppressive pressure slowly surrounded Qing Shui, it seemed as sharp as a knife and its might was palpable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly stepped forward, completely covering Yiye Jiange behind him!</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>State of Immovable as Mountains!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui firmly blocked the imposing air that they were continuously sending to him. His expression did not change and he just looked calmly at the old man: “Don’t regret this.”</p>
 <p>“Young man, you are too arrogant, do you really think that no one in the Greencloud Continent can defeat you? Let me tell you that there are many people who are hidden that can defeat you.” The old man did not show any signs of weakness and mocked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Haha, so what? Are you sure you can defeat me? You have only seen the surface, at such an old age and yet you are still making such a basic mistake, don’t you feel that it is sad?” Qing Shui slowly circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and blocked the old man’s suppressing pressure.</p>
 <p>“The biggest weakness of a youth is their ignorance and arrogance! From the start to the end, they might not even know how they died. Anyways, we have to kill you today, just blame the position that you now hold.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll say this again, if you are a man, bring my two daughters here first.” Qing Shui wanted to see Luan Luan and Yuchang before anything else happened.</p>
 <p>The old man found that although he had already raised his imposing air to the maximum, the target still seemed unaffected. He started to have some doubt in his heart. He understood a lot of things about Qing Shui. When he looked at him, he felt that this young man was a very smart man. Could it be that he came today because he had the confidence of bringing the two children away…...</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly used the tyrannical Emperor's Qi to lock down on the three people in front of him, then he took a step forward. Unknowingly, he had incorporated the ‘Walking Tiger’ into his steps, causing his might to increase. He created an impact like a crashing mountain. The Emperor's Qi immediately reduced all their abilities by 20 %.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>An indistinct tiger’s roar resounded like thunder, scaring them till their scalp went numb!</p>
 <p>“Don’t force my hand, unless you want to force me to completely kill everyone here!” Qing Shui did not cover up his intentions.</p>
 <p>At this, the three old men’s expressions changed, but they could no longer stop. They had already felt that the situation was no longer that simple. At first they thought they could handle it as long as the youth was below the realm of Martial Saint. However, they now found that they had made a big mistake.</p>
 <p>Especially Qing Shui’s words that were filled with an intimidating force, threatening to kill everyone. The old man looked at the surroundings, there were all the people from his Zhan Clan here, if there were any mishaps, then he would cause all of them to die together.</p>
 <p>The old man had lived for hundreds of years. He turned his head and told another old man: “the children probably did not mean it, Zhan Yuan, return the two children to him first, but we must settle today’s matter.”</p>
 <p>The old man faced the young man he intended to kill, while the two girls were released. This way, if there were any unexpected accidents, it would not result in the Zhan Clan and the people here dying. Although the old man was confident, he still wanted to be careful. It was important to not count his chickens before they hatched…...</p>
