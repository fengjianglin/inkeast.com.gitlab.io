 <p><strong>AST 781 - Lady of Unparalleled Beauty, Tantai Xuan</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui naturally knew that they were talking about Tantai Xuan. It seemed like this lady also had a very unusual position among the Tantai Clan. Since she only returned once every few years, it was naturally very normal for her return to be regarded seriously. Of course, the main reason was still because of her strength.</p>
 <p>“I’d be delighted,” Qing Shui said with a smile. He didn’t have too much of a change in his expression. This secretly impressed the old man and the people of the Tantai Clan. No one would usually be able to remain this calm when told that they would see her, let alone being introduced to her. Perhaps this was because he had only been at the Southern Sea City for a short while.</p>
 <p>However, those that had been invited to the Tantai Residence would most likely have knowledge of Tantai Clan’s background. It was definitely impossible for one to not know of Tantai Xuan if they knew about the current Tantai Clan. Setting aside the Tantai Clan, Tantai Xuan’s identity of being the pinnacle among the youth was dazzling enough already. On top of that, she wasn’t only the top among the younger generation.</p>
 <p>“Old Master is really blessed. A descendant like Miss Tantai is more than enough to make everyone around you extremely jealous.” Qing Shui continued after his previous sentence. This wasn’t really a flattery, but it was definitely something people would love to hear.</p>
 <p>“Hoho, Qing Shui, you don’t have to be modest either. I personally believe that you aren’t the least bit inferior to my girl. Although you may still slightly lack in control, I have a feeling that you will be able to soar high up into the skies very soon.” The old man told Qing Shui sincerely.</p>
 <p>“I pray that Old Master’s auspicious words will come true.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“Old Ancestor, I’ll go fetch big sister.” Tantai Aoyun smiled at the old man.</p>
 <p>“Go then.”</p>
 <p>Tantai Aoyun excused himself with a smile and walked outside after hearing the old man’s response. Qing Shui looked at the couple that were still here. The man was extremely handsome, although he appeared to be middle aged. Even Canghai lost a little compared to the composed and gentle aura he exuded, and even when compared to his unrivalled looks.</p>
 <p>The man hadn’t spoke much after he greeted Qing Shui earlier, but Tantai Aoyun had addressed him as father during the conversation. That was how Qing Shui found out that perhaps the couple were Tantai Xuan’s parents, but Qing Shui still wasn’t certain if Tantai Xuan and Tantai Aoyun were biological siblings.</p>
 <p>That middle-aged lady wasn’t really lavishly dressed, but she seemed like she would still be stunning no matter what she wore. He couldn’t really guess the age of that lady either. The mature charm she exuded, her extremely well developed body figure, her fair and jade-like skin, her silky hair that was pulled in a high bun, her straight nose, those lips with hints of a smile, and her beautiful eyes were extremely enticing.</p>
 <p>“Let us go to the big lounge.” The old man gently smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui greeted the others with a nod and they slowly walked to the lounge in the front courtyard. Qing Shui calculated the time, they should reach the front courtyard by the time Tantai Xuan returned.</p>
 <p>When they arrived at the front courtyard, Qing Shui saw two people coming in from the entrance. One was Tantai Aoyun, the other one was a veiled lady. The lady had a very tall figure and was only half a head shorter than Tantai Aoyun.</p>
 <p>The lady was dressed in a plain snowy white dress. Although her sleeves were a slightly too long and covered half of her palms, they seemed harmoniously aesthetic to Qing Shui. Her face was partly concealed by a snowy white veil. Her eyes were unconcealed though, and Qing Shui was stunned by them. It took him a lot of strength to look away from them.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t because her eyes were as brilliant as the stars in the sky. They didn’t exude an otherworldly aura like Yiye Jiange, they weren’t as deep as Canghai Mingyue, they weren’t as unique as Di Chen, or graceful like Hai Dongqing. Qing Shui couldn’t quite put his finger on it. If he really had to describe them, her eyes were somewhat graceful, outstanding, sacred and a little deep.</p>
 <p>It was Qing Shui’s first time seeing such a pair of beautiful eyes that were so enchantingly sacred. She had a wave of strange energy in her body that made one have the impulse to worship her.</p>
 <p>Her delicate feet moved lightly, and the movement between her steps were as natural as the moving clouds and flowing water. She was a woman whose beauty was already unparalleled without even looking at her face. Her beauty was in the aura and temperament that she exuded.</p>
 <p>This was a woman that wasn’t in the least bit inferior to Di Chen, Yiye Jiange and the rest. Not only that, she was also so powerful that she could make a man feel inferior. The woman quickened her pace when she saw so many people coming out from the Tantai Residence.</p>
 <p>“Old Ancestor, how many times have I told you not to have so many people come out? I’m a junior, this isn’t appropriate.” The woman had a very similar voice to Di Chen. It was melodious and sacred, but her voice gave off a lighter feeling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very fond of Di Chen’s voice even though his other women had better voices. Each and everyone of them had a distinct quality to their voices though. Hearing this woman from the Tantai Clan speak gave him a familiar feeling.</p>
 <p>“We happen to come here.” The old man chuckled. From the tone of his voice, anyone could tell how happy the old man was and how much he doted on her.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xuan!”</p>
 <p>“Little Sister!”</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know how she presented herself outside. At least she looked to be very comfortable at home now, it seemed very natural. She never took her veil off though, Qing Shui guessed that it might be because of his presence.</p>
 <p>He realized that this woman was very similar to Di Chen from back then. They both dressed in plain white clothes and wore veils. A smile broke across his face as he recalled these memories, it had been a long while since he last saw them. He realized that he missed them quite a bit.</p>
 <p>“Xuan’er, let me introduce a strong junior to you.” The old man smiled.</p>
 <p>“Oh? I’m quite curious to know who could make the Old Ancestor acknowledge his strength.” There was a hint of smile in Tantai Xuan’s beautiful eyes as she immediately shifted her gaze to Qing Shui. There was only one person she didn’t know, so the person in question would naturally be him.</p>
 <p>“Xuan’er, this is Qing Shui. Both of you should get to know each other.” The old man smiled and made a simple introduction.</p>
 <p>“How do you do, Miss Tantai? You really are as divine as the legendary immortals.” Qing Shui greeted with a smile.</p>
 <p>“So you are Qing Shui.” Although Tantai Xuan’s distinct voice was very calm, Qing Shui could see the surprise which flashed across her divinely beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>“You know about me, Miss?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui soon realized how stupid his question sounded. Although it hadn’t been very long since he arrived at the Southern Sea City, news about him was everywhere now.</p>
 <p>“The moment I arrived at the Southern Sea City, the discussions I heard about the most involved you. I didn’t expect to meet you as soon as I returned home. It’s surprising to know that the person who destroyed the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan would be this young.” Tantai Xuan stood a few metres away from Qing Shui. Her sacred eyes were very soothing to look at, and she had been very serene.</p>
 <p>She appeared to be very amiable, yet also very unapproachable. Qing Shui didn’t know what he was feeling. Perhaps it was because he was at the Tantai Aristocrat Clan and was being introduced by the Tantai Clan’s old man. He couldn’t help but feel that this woman can be seen, but not claimed.</p>
 <p>After they exchanged a few words, Qing Shui turned around and smiled at Tantai Clan’s old man. “Miss Tantai has returned, I’m sure you have a lot to discuss with her. I will not bother you any longer.”</p>
 <p>Despite Tantai Clan’s old man and Tantai Xuan’s persuasion, Qing Shui still insisted on leaving. In the end, the old man told him, “Let us know if you are leaving here. This old man will see you off from the Southern Sea Country.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your kindness, Old Master.”</p>
 <p>They saw Qing Shui off from the Tantai Clan and watched his silhouette disappear into the distance. Tantai Clan’s old man smiled, “Xuan’er, what do you think of this young man?”</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was actually quite curious about him because this was her first time meeting someone who didn’t have much reaction after seeing her. She could clearly feel that he didn’t have the slightest hint of reluctance when he left.</p>
 <p>“This is my first time seeing such a peculiar person, he is very strong as well. There’s an unknown energy within his body. He must be a person with unswerving determination.” Tantai Xuan answered after thinking for a moment.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s not talk about him anymore. How long are you staying this time?” The old man asked while he walked back towards the house with Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>“Three days, I think.” Tantai Xuan replied as she walked.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui returned to the Ye Clan once he took his leave from the Tantai Clan. He shouldn’t wrap his head around things that exceeded his imagination.</p>
 <p>Three days passed before he could realize it. Qing Shui spent his time peacefully at the Ye Residence. Qing Shui only knew today that the Ye Clan had actually went to the Deep Sea City once over the past few days. Those people from Ye Clan who had participated in this scheme had also received their proper punishments.</p>
 <p>This was how a society worked according to the laws of the jungle.</p>
 <p>The Ye Clan was firm about it and Qing Shui was actually very supportive of their way of handling this issue. One must be ruthless when dealing with people who deserved it. He had realized that the Ye Clan had done it very well. Everything was handled by Ye Guyan. Ye Clan’s old man was usually not involved in Ye Clan’s matter unless Ye Guyan specifically looked for him.</p>
 <p>“No need to see us off. We will take a quick look at the Southern Sea before returning. By that time, we will trouble you again for another one or two days.” Qing Shui, Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, and Bai Gui stood on the back of Fire Bird and told the people of Ye Clan.</p>
 <p>“Be careful on your journey. Ye Clan is also your home, we welcome you anytime.” Ye Guyan smiled. The way she put it sounded very ambiguous. But since everyone had a very heavy mood, no one bothered about things like these.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, I will.”</p>
 <p>Fire Bird disappeared from everyone’s sight. In the end, Qing Shui had decided to take a look around the Southern Sea. Since there was no way he could make it back in time before his child was born, he might as well enjoy the Southern Sea before returning. He had no idea when would he visit the Southern Sea Country again after he returned this time. He supposed that he would never even return to some places again.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya and the rest seemed very happy. With their wishes fulfilled, looking at the Southern Sea was not a bad idea. They didn’t know anything about Shi Qingzhuang and Mingyue Gelou’s pregnancies. Since there was no way they could make it in time, there was no harm in delaying a little more. They just had to hurry a little more on their return journey.</p>
 <p>The Southern Sea was said to be located at the southernmost part of the World of the Nine Continents, at least for now. No one had discovered anything at the southern side of the Southern sea. After ten days, Qing Shui finally saw the Southern Sea. The seawater stretched out boundlessly. He had no idea how many times his field of vision had widened. Ascending mountains and watching the seas were activities that could enhance mental states.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of people at the Southern Sea beach. Qing Shui had already put away his mount before they reached there. The four of them walked towards the beach by foot.</p>
