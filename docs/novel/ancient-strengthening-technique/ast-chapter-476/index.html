  <p dir="ltr"><strong>476 - Mighty Elephant Stomp Intertwined; Frightening Strength of Ten Countries</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The large Tigon Beast Champion’s tail swiped toward the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The huge beast continuously roared!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Bloody Butcher had rushed to Qing Shui’s side, the battle-ax in his hands slicing horizontally at him, this ferocious strength was the greatest Qing Shui had ever faced so far!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger's Mount!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Crouching Tiger on the Mountains!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui raised his vigor to it’s peak, with the Godly Force Talisman and Divine Shield Talisman, his strength had increased significantly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pierced his sword toward the gigantic battle-ax, he unhesitatingly reduced his opponent’s speed and also increased his opponent’s weight!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Very strong!” Qing Shui felt his body shook till it went numb. He noticed that Bloody Butcher was not faring any better, his heart feeling relieved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bloody Butcher wasn’t feeling very relaxed anymore, he could feel a discomfort in his body, his eyebrow knitted together, and he ferociously shouted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On his body was a faint, beautiful glow!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could obviously feel that after that lion-like roar, the effects of the Art of Pursuing had vanished, or was reduced.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Interesting!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again charged at Blood Butcher with his sword, in the exchange, Qing Shui applied the Art of Pursuing again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the 20% increase in weight and 20% decrease in speed affecting Bloody Butcher once again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Bloody Butcher did not roar again like he had earlier, but calmly raised his battle-ax. Slowly, the originally black battle-ax gained a tinge of red, it was mixed with the black and turned into a dark red color.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s face had a cautious look because he could feel an evil power from the battle-ax, causing people to feel uneasy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Prrrtttt!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, there was the sound of the earth shaking!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant standing in front of a huge fissure, and the Tigon Beast Champion was in mid-air!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The reason was because this time when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant charged toward to Tigon Beast Champion, it suddenly activated the Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From that moment, a fissure had appeared under the feet of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, spreading toward the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion had a very quick reaction; its huge body leaped up, but at this moment, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant charged toward the Tigon Beast Champion, who was mid-air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The “Tremor of Stormy Cloud” was glowing with a bright light and pierced toward the neck of the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If the Diamond Gigantic Elephant hit its mark, even the Tigon Beast Champion would be severely injured, to the point of losing all its battle strength. It was after, all, the weak point of the Tigon Beast Champion. Furthermore, the “Tremor of Stormy Cloud” was not worn just for decoration.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ding!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But at this moment, a silver longsword pierced toward the eyes of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, causing it to change its direction.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion was enraged, while in mid-air, it swished its large tail at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s body. At the same time, the silver longsword also pierced the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant let loose a loud roar; there was a small hole that had pierced the gigantic elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo had made his move!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was surprised at Feng Shamo’s swordsmanship, he could actually pierce through the defense of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, even though it was a small injury! Or maybe it wasn’t that that had broken through the defense, but rather, the results from the mastery of a weapon, of course, Feng Shamo’s longsword was probably not an ordinary object and that had also contributed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was also shocked that Feng Shamo had also grasped the concept of the application of strength, taking one jin of strength and turning it into two jin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the result of training a martial technique to a certain realm, this kind of realm had no clear definition of grades, just like traditionally attacking the weak point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hearing the painful roar of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Qing Shui felt a stab in his heart and angrily glared at Feng Shamo.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How shameless, the Feng Clan’s old man is truly shameless, two old men joining their hands together to deal with one youth!” Huoyun Liu-Li scolded when she saw Feng Shamo make his move.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Exactly, the Feng Clan has always been shameless!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Feng Clan, hm, this is normal for them, you have no idea of all the shameless things they have already committed.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Really? Snatched an ordinary girl?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s nothing, they even snatched a bride.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder sister, what should we do?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked toward Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We wait, if we go, we are only adding to the chaos!” Canghai Mingyue frowned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old man Cang, should we go down and interfere with Feng Shamo?” You An looked at Cang Wuya and frowned as he asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s wait first, Qing Shui told us earlier not to interfere, we will observe the situation first!” Cang Wuya said as he clenched his fist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This elephant is really sturdy, a Peak Martial King Tigon Beast Champion seemed to be insufficient to damage it.” A handsome middle-aged man said thoughtfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This elephant is as hard as diamonds, is it possible to kill it?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Tigon Beast Champion is not its match, the elephant is too strong, is it possible for it to break into the Martial Saint level in the future?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bloody Butcher was aware of Feng Shamo’s move, at first, he had frowned, but he quickly became silent. From the situation of the earlier clash, he knew the Tigon Beast Champion would have been gored to death. Had it not been for Feng Shamo, his Tigon Beast Champion would be severely wounded. Once the Tigon Beast Champion lost its battle power, then his own situation would worsen.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this juncture, maybe his life outweighed his reputation, furthermore, Feng Shamo had already made a move! Since there was already condemnation for this, he might as well make it worth it. Bloody Butcher was not weak, not allowing Feng Shamo to help was the pride of a cultivator, it had nothing to do with being a good or bad person. Since Feng Shamo had made his move at that moment, he had no other alternatives.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Grasping the battle-ax, which was emitting a dark red glow, Bloody Butcher’s face looked sinister!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Feng Shamo rushed over brandishing his sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used the Seven Star Armored Vest and also took out the Binding Talisman he had prepared long ago!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Binding Talisman drawn by the Golden Calligraphy Brush could lower the opponent's speed by 30% of Qing Shui’s speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui directly stuck it on Bloody Butcher, who was rushing at him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bloody Butcher’s speed was originally already slower that Qing Shui by a little, in addition, he had already been affected by the Art of Pursuing, causing a 20% decrease in speed. Now, there was an additional 30% decrease based on Qing Shui’s speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In total, it had caused Bloody Butcher to lose more than 60% of his speed, making Bloody Butcher to want to cry!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found that the Art of Pursuing and Binding Talisman had very good synergy, directly turning a strong Peak Martial King cultivator into trash. Without speed, they could only stand there and get hit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of a sudden, Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword clashed with Feng Shamo’s longsword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shaken into retreat, he could feel his qi and blood in turmoil!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Indeed Feng Shamo was in that realm as well. Although it still differed from the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor to some extent, it was still higher than himself. When Qing Shui received that blow, if it wasn’t for his strong body and the Seven Star Armored Vest, he would have been seriously injured! In addition, he had the Divine Arm Clearing, Divine Feet Clearing and Back Connecting Fist, or else he would have made a fool of himself with this exchange.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once again Qing Shui took the Big Dipper Sword and clashed with Feng Shamo’s sword once again, without any further sounds.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, don’t clash swords with him……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that it was too late, Qing Shui even used all his strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still retreated a few steps back!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo found a white gleam came from inside his clothes on his chest, Qing Shui’s Spiritual sense discovered the effects of the Art of Pursuing had disappeared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Damn it! How can it be like this! What use is the Art of Pursuing then?” Qing Shui felt depressed!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taking out a Binding Talisman; “In that case, I will use the Binding Talisman to lower your speed!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The technique of attaching the talisman was very important; as long as you had speed, to make sure the opponent could not avoid you, and as long as it could be crushed beside him, it would be completed. However, it was too sudden, but Feng Shamo had already hidden away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Binding Talisman unintentionally struck the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion, who roared loudly, tried to slash the Diamond Gigantic Elephant with its claws, but missed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Again!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again took out a Binding Talisman, after all, he had a large stockpile from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, that had been specially prepared for today.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s speed was not inferior to Feng Shamo. Qing Shui knew this was the results of the Great Perfection Stage of the Divine Feet Clearing and the boots he was wearing; after these had raised his speed, only then could he be comparable to Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Discovering an opportunity, Qing Shui slashed at the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What made Qing Shui happy was that there was a wound on the Tigon Beast Champion, caused by his Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar, woo!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, there was a great reduction in speed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This only took a moment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bloody Butcher sensed that he could not keep up with Qing Shui’s footsteps, and decided to rush toward the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, wielding his humongous dark red battle-ax.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Feng Shamo adjusted his mental conditions, he then rushed toward the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui had confidence in his Diamond Gigantic Elephant, &nbsp;when looking at Bloody Butcher’s and Feng Shamo’s weapons, Qing Shui was afraid there might be a mishap.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But at this moment, Qing Shui clenched his jaw, telepathically summoning his Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui stomped on the Tigon Beast Champion!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui had an enormous twelve and half million jin of strength in his body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Multiplied by five!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was the more than the strength of six countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui also instructed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to use the Mighty Elephant Stomp on the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion, whose speed had decreased by 50% due to the Art of Pursuing and Binding Talisman, could only watch as that huge amount of power arrived at its body in a flash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Two sets of huge tearing force converged onto the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was greater than the strength of ten countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A thunderous sound rang out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a terrifying crack and dust flew into the air, the large sound of the explosion caused the surrounding 100 meters to become a hole, multiple pavilions around the Feng Clan were flattened.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sorrowful roar caused many to tremble!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the Ice Crane in the air flew higher by a few meters!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A large shockwave caused the surrounding grass and earth to be overturned, the large trees nearby were shattered by the shock, even many that were far away had broken.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not make any other moves after exhibiting the Mighty Elephant Stomp. Even Feng Shamo rapidly withdrew. Due to his speed, Bloody Butcher was shaken till he was vomiting blood, as he flew backward.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">On his body was a faint, beautiful glow!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could obviously feel that after that lion-like roar, the effects of the Art of Pursuing had vanished, or was reduced.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Interesting!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again charged at Blood Butcher with his sword, in the exchange, Qing Shui applied the Art of Pursuing again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the 20% increase in weight and 20% decrease in speed affecting Bloody Butcher once again!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Bloody Butcher did not roar again like he had earlier, but calmly raised his battle-ax. Slowly, the originally black battle-ax gained a tinge of red, it was mixed with the black and turned into a dark red color.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s face had a cautious look because he could feel an evil power from the battle-ax, causing people to feel uneasy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Prrrtttt!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, there was the sound of the earth shaking!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant standing in front of a huge fissure, and the Tigon Beast Champion was in mid-air!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The reason was because this time when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant charged toward to Tigon Beast Champion, it suddenly activated the Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From that moment, a fissure had appeared under the feet of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, spreading toward the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion had a very quick reaction; its huge body leaped up, but at this moment, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant charged toward the Tigon Beast Champion, who was mid-air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The “Tremor of Stormy Cloud” was glowing with a bright light and pierced toward the neck of the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If the Diamond Gigantic Elephant hit its mark, even the Tigon Beast Champion would be severely injured, to the point of losing all its battle strength. It was after, all, the weak point of the Tigon Beast Champion. Furthermore, the “Tremor of Stormy Cloud” was not worn just for decoration.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ding!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But at this moment, a silver longsword pierced toward the eyes of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, causing it to change its direction.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion was enraged, while in mid-air, it swished its large tail at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s body. At the same time, the silver longsword also pierced the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant let loose a loud roar; there was a small hole that had pierced the gigantic elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo had made his move!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was surprised at Feng Shamo’s swordsmanship, he could actually pierce through the defense of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, even though it was a small injury! Or maybe it wasn’t that that had broken through the defense, but rather, the results from the mastery of a weapon, of course, Feng Shamo’s longsword was probably not an ordinary object and that had also contributed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was also shocked that Feng Shamo had also grasped the concept of the application of strength, taking one jin of strength and turning it into two jin.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the result of training a martial technique to a certain realm, this kind of realm had no clear definition of grades, just like traditionally attacking the weak point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hearing the painful roar of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Qing Shui felt a stab in his heart and angrily glared at Feng Shamo.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How shameless, the Feng Clan’s old man is truly shameless, two old men joining their hands together to deal with one youth!” Huoyun Liu-Li scolded when she saw Feng Shamo make his move.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Exactly, the Feng Clan has always been shameless!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Feng Clan, hm, this is normal for them, you have no idea of all the shameless things they have already committed.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Really? Snatched an ordinary girl?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s nothing, they even snatched a bride.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder sister, what should we do?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked toward Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We wait, if we go, we are only adding to the chaos!” Canghai Mingyue frowned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old man Cang, should we go down and interfere with Feng Shamo?” You An looked at Cang Wuya and frowned as he asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s wait first, Qing Shui told us earlier not to interfere, we will observe the situation first!” Cang Wuya said as he clenched his fist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This elephant is really sturdy, a Peak Martial King Tigon Beast Champion seemed to be insufficient to damage it.” A handsome middle-aged man said thoughtfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This elephant is as hard as diamonds, is it possible to kill it?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Tigon Beast Champion is not its match, the elephant is too strong, is it possible for it to break into the Martial Saint level in the future?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bloody Butcher was aware of Feng Shamo’s move, at first, he had frowned, but he quickly became silent. From the situation of the earlier clash, he knew the Tigon Beast Champion would have been gored to death. Had it not been for Feng Shamo, his Tigon Beast Champion would be severely wounded. Once the Tigon Beast Champion lost its battle power, then his own situation would worsen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this juncture, maybe his life outweighed his reputation, furthermore, Feng Shamo had already made a move! Since there was already condemnation for this, he might as well make it worth it. Bloody Butcher was not weak, not allowing Feng Shamo to help was the pride of a cultivator, it had nothing to do with being a good or bad person. Since Feng Shamo had made his move at that moment, he had no other alternatives.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Grasping the battle-ax, which was emitting a dark red glow, Bloody Butcher’s face looked sinister!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Feng Shamo rushed over brandishing his sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used the Seven Star Armored Vest and also took out the Binding Talisman he had prepared long ago!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Binding Talisman drawn by the Golden Calligraphy Brush could lower the opponent's speed by 30% of Qing Shui’s speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui directly stuck it on Bloody Butcher, who was rushing at him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bloody Butcher’s speed was originally already slower that Qing Shui by a little, in addition, he had already been affected by the Art of Pursuing, causing a 20% decrease in speed. Now, there was an additional 30% decrease based on Qing Shui’s speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In total, it had caused Bloody Butcher to lose more than 60% of his speed, making Bloody Butcher to want to cry!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found that the Art of Pursuing and Binding Talisman had very good synergy, directly turning a strong Peak Martial King cultivator into trash. Without speed, they could only stand there and get hit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of a sudden, Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword clashed with Feng Shamo’s longsword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shaken into retreat, he could feel his qi and blood in turmoil!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Indeed Feng Shamo was in that realm as well. Although it still differed from the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor to some extent, it was still higher than himself. When Qing Shui received that blow, if it wasn’t for his strong body and the Seven Star Armored Vest, he would have been seriously injured! In addition, he had the Divine Arm Clearing, Divine Feet Clearing and Back Connecting Fist, or else he would have made a fool of himself with this exchange.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once again Qing Shui took the Big Dipper Sword and clashed with Feng Shamo’s sword once again, without any further sounds.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, don’t clash swords with him……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that it was too late, Qing Shui even used all his strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui still retreated a few steps back!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo found a white gleam came from inside his clothes on his chest, Qing Shui’s Spiritual sense discovered the effects of the Art of Pursuing had disappeared.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Damn it! How can it be like this! What use is the Art of Pursuing then?” Qing Shui felt depressed!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Taking out a Binding Talisman; “In that case, I will use the Binding Talisman to lower your speed!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The technique of attaching the talisman was very important; as long as you had speed, to make sure the opponent could not avoid you, and as long as it could be crushed beside him, it would be completed. However, it was too sudden, but Feng Shamo had already hidden away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Binding Talisman unintentionally struck the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion, who roared loudly, tried to slash the Diamond Gigantic Elephant with its claws, but missed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Again!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again took out a Binding Talisman, after all, he had a large stockpile from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, that had been specially prepared for today.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s speed was not inferior to Feng Shamo. Qing Shui knew this was the results of the Great Perfection Stage of the Divine Feet Clearing and the boots he was wearing; after these had raised his speed, only then could he be comparable to Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Discovering an opportunity, Qing Shui slashed at the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What made Qing Shui happy was that there was a wound on the Tigon Beast Champion, caused by his Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar, woo!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, there was a great reduction in speed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This only took a moment!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bloody Butcher sensed that he could not keep up with Qing Shui’s footsteps, and decided to rush toward the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, wielding his humongous dark red battle-ax.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Feng Shamo adjusted his mental conditions, he then rushed toward the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui had confidence in his Diamond Gigantic Elephant, &nbsp;when looking at Bloody Butcher’s and Feng Shamo’s weapons, Qing Shui was afraid there might be a mishap.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But at this moment, Qing Shui clenched his jaw, telepathically summoning his Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui stomped on the Tigon Beast Champion!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui had an enormous twelve and half million jin of strength in his body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Multiplied by five!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was the more than the strength of six countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui also instructed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to use the Mighty Elephant Stomp on the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Tigon Beast Champion, whose speed had decreased by 50% due to the Art of Pursuing and Binding Talisman, could only watch as that huge amount of power arrived at its body in a flash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Two sets of huge tearing force converged onto the Tigon Beast Champion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was greater than the strength of ten countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A thunderous sound rang out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a terrifying crack and dust flew into the air, the large sound of the explosion caused the surrounding 100 meters to become a hole, multiple pavilions around the Feng Clan were flattened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sorrowful roar caused many to tremble!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the Ice Crane in the air flew higher by a few meters!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A large shockwave caused the surrounding grass and earth to be overturned, the large trees nearby were shattered by the shock, even many that were far away had broken.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not make any other moves after exhibiting the Mighty Elephant Stomp. Even Feng Shamo rapidly withdrew. Due to his speed, Bloody Butcher was shaken till he was vomiting blood, as he flew backward.</p>
