 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0140 The Dignified, Pure and Holy Diamond Fruit</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t even turn around, and completely left the place. Xiang Bao’s heart was once again drowned in ice cold water. This time around, it was even more heart wrenching than the previous times.</p>
  <p>By the time he had reached the Qing Clan, it was not even noon yet. Mingyue Gelou was playing with the little girl. Seeing that Qing Shui had returned, her face was immediately dyed in a layer mesmerizing red.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, high!” The little girl reached out her two small arms and called out happily upon seeing Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carried her and then tossed her up into the air. That melodious voice of the child was like that of a happy angel, making Qing Shui forget everything else, as he was brought into a sea of happiness by the purity of that smile.</p>
  <p>“Mingyue, come, I’ll give you something in the room.” There was only Yuanying and Mingyue Gelou in the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store at that the moment.</p>
  <p>“Mmm!”</p>
  <p>Every time Mingyue Gelou and Qing Shui’s gaze came into contact, she would avoid his gaze in a panic. This shyness from a mature and charming lady was very tempting, making Qing Shui understand what it felt like to have a deer cantering about in your heart. </p>
  <p>Carrying the little girl in one hand, Qing Shui held onto the soft and tender hands of Mingyue Gelou, and even mischievously blinked at her to make her feel even more ashamed.</p>
  <p>Entering Qing Shui’s room, he saw a pile of neatly folded blankets which were folded by Mingyue Gelou. He recalled the charming scene where they had bound together the night before, and unknowingly, his eyes feel on the peaks of Mingyue Gelou’s delicate body.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, stop looking!” Mingyue Gelou could not stand it and said shyly.</p>
  <p>“This can help you retain your youth for ten years. These two are very good as well. Take them as a present from your husband!” Qing Shui took out one Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit and two Defense-Enhancing Fruits and grinned.</p>
  <p>The Defense-Enhancing Fruit not only increased one’s Qi, but it mainly strengthened one’s muscles and bones, as well as the internal organs. It also increased one’s endurance and strength. </p>
  <p>“Daddy, eat, eat!” The little girl reached out her tiny hands in a bid to snatch them!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had long ago prepared a red-colored fruit for her, but it was not yet the time for her to take such things. Mingyue Gelou’s gaze towards Qing Shui’s was very warm, and she did not even object to Qing Shui calling himself her husband. She then slowly ate up all the fruits.</p>
  <p>She was a weak lady. After eating the Defense-Enhancing Fruits, Mingyue Gelou very quickly felt its mysterious effects. Usually, she would feel tired after carrying Little Yuchang for a while, but now, she felt as if she had an endless amount of energy. It was a wonderful feeling.</p>
  <p>“Thank you, Qing Shui.” The dignified, pure and beautiful face broke into a warm smile.</p>
  <p>“If you’re still so polite with me, be careful that I might whack you on the butt.” Qing Shui smiled, mischievousness reflecting in his eyes. That gaze made Mingyue Gelou recall the shy event that had occurred the night before.</p>
  <p>“Whack butt!” Little Yuchang grinned and called out.</p>
  <p>Looking at Qing Shui’s mischievous smile, Mingyue Gelou threw him a seductive glance. It was just that that seductive glance contained too much purity that Qing Shui’s heart pounded hard. He really felt like tumbling around with her, but the little girl was still around.</p>
  <p>“Mingyue, do you want to take up martial arts?” Qing Shui gave it some thought. In order to take the Golden Pellet, one would need to reach the pinnacle of Houtain. Qing Shui hoped that she would be able to spend a long time beside him, even if it was only the additional 500 years of lifespan a Xiantian cultivator would get.</p>
  <p>“Can I still train?” Mingyue Gelou asked in astonishment.</p>
  <p>“Of course you can. I’m going to help you attain Xiantian. By then, you would have an additional lifespan of 500 years, and as a couple we would be able to bring the little girl around travelling happily.” Qing Shui smiled as he carried the little girl who was already asleep.</p>
  <p>“Xiantian… it’s a wishful thought. Mingyue must thank you even if is merely wishful thinking.”</p>
  <p>“Hehe, you’re mine now, what’s there to thank? With your husband around, there’s still some hope to let you attain Xiantian!” Qing Shui smiled sneakily as he took a step forward. The light fragrance of Mingyue Gelou floated to his nose.</p>
  <p>“Ahh!” Looking at Qing Shui, her face turned red.</p>
  <p>“Mingyue!”</p>
  <p>“Mmm!”</p>
  <p>“I’d like to kiss you!”</p>
  <p>Carrying the little girl in his arms, Qing Shui bent down his head and planted a peck on Mingyue Gelou’s petal-like lips, gently sucking on her lips, slowly and softly.</p>
  <p>The soft touch, the slight taste of moistness and sweetness, the smoothness and bounciness… Qing Shui tugged and nibbled on it gently. Slowly, he pried open Mingyue Gelou’s mouth, and sucked on her small little tongue, greedily sucking on the sweet nectar of her mouth.</p>
  <p>Mingyue Gelou’s eyes were half closed, and her pretty face had an expression that seems to be asking for more while appearing reluctant. It really fired Qing Shui up. Finally, Qing Shui let go of the breathless Mingyue Gelou!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui heard the voices of people outside, and knew that his mother was back. He passed the little girl back to Mingyue Gelou, saying, “I’ll be downstairs. Later, bring our daughter down for food.”</p>
  <p>“Mmm, you go ahead.” Her pretty face looked as if she had been just been through a round of sex, appearing very seductive.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui entered Qing Yi’s room. Seeing Qing Yi, he took out a Golden Ringed Snake Fruit and two Endurance-Enhancing Fruits. “Mother, these are for you!” Qing Shui smiled. Facing Qing Yi, Qing Shui’s smile was always silly and honest.</p>
  <p>“Diamond Fruit!” Qing Yi was slightly astonished when she saw the Defense-Enhancing Fruit. She was no longer as easily astonished these days when Qing Shui brought out extremely precious items.</p>
  <p>Regardless, whether it was the Strength-Enhancing Fruit, the Agility-Enhancing Fruit, or the Defense-Enhancing Fruit, they would all take a hundred years to reach their maturity. Moreover, they could only grow under special environments, thus their value wasn’t considered any less than thousand year old medicinal herbs.</p>
  <p>“What is this golden-colored fruit?” Qing Yi asked curiously when she saw the Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit.</p>
  <p>“This is the Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit, something which can let mother retain her youth for another ten years!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Mother is already old and has no use for it. Keep it for your future wife instead.” Qing Yi smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“There’s no hurry for that!”</p>
  <p>“”Qing Shui, mother has something to discuss with you.” Qing Yi said hesitantly.</p>
  <p>“Go ahead, your son will listen to everything you say.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“Mother will not do that. Whatever you do, mother will not interfere with your decision. I just want to ask what are you planning to do about Mingyue?” Qing Yi asked, smiling gently.</p>
  <p>“About this, you can just treat her like your daughter-in-law, what do you think?” Qing Shui scratched his head and said.</p>
  <p>“Sure, why not? Mingyue has led a tough life. Putting aside her past, since you like her, you’ll have to treat her well. Even if you were to have other women in the future, you cannot just abandon her.” Qing Yi said solemnly.</p>
  <p>“Mother knows me best. How could I do something like that?” Qing Shui said happily. He did not expect to get through this so easily. He had thought that he would face objection. Qing Shui only cared about Qing Yi alone. So long as Qing Yi did not object, it wouldn’t matter who else did!</p>
  <p>After all, his status was different now. In addition, Mingyue Gelou was a woman who already had a child. While she was pretty, it would be bad for their reputation.</p>
  <p>“Mother, you’re the most open-minded mother!” Qing Shui had the thinking of two different worlds. So what if it was a woman who had went through a divorce or was a widow? In his previous life, even boy/girlfriends could just get a room and do whatever.</p>
  <p>“Mother, I have something to discuss with you.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, what do you have to discuss with me?” Qing Yi smiled and said, her tone slightly tinged with teasing.</p>
  <p>“That… the rumors about Shi Qingzhuang and myself are real. While it was an accident, I wanted to make things firm. Therefore, I’m letting you know first, so that you are prepared for it.” Qing Shui said awkwardly.</p>
  <p>Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui, stunned, before she asked with a weird look. “Then what about Wu-shuang?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, about Wu-shuang, we’ll see how it goes!” Qing Shui said helplessly.</p>
  <p>“You rascal. Such a flirt at such a young age. But you’re my son, so I support you. If you have the ability to bring back all the beauties in the world, mother would be happier.” Qing Yi smiled and rubbed Qing Shui on the head.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was speechless, but a mother knew her son best!</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, so long as it is not something that brings disgrace, is devoid of conscience or something that heaven and earth will not tolerate, then mother would support you. But, the girl from Shi Clan is already the Situ Clan’s betrothed. Could it be that you’re thinking of snatching?”</p>
  <p>“There’s no need to snatch. The Situ Clan will know to retreat. I will go direct to Shi Clan to propose the marriage. The Shi Clan will directly look for Situ Clan to reject the marriage themselves!” Qing Shui thought about it and said.</p>
  <p>“Sigh, to think that our Qing Clan going to bully others with force too!” Qing Yi sighed.</p>
  <p>“Even if I didn’t propose the marriage, the Shi Clan could still reject the marriage, because I know for a fact that Shi Qingzhuang does not like Situ Bufan at all. With my understanding of her, she is likely to reject the marriage anyway!” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
  <p>“Whatever you choose to do, I feel assured. Go ahead and do whatever you feel like doing!”</p>
  <p>Qing Yi gently hugged Qing Shui, saying, “My son has grown up, and will only grow further away from his mother!”</p>
  <p>After saying this, Qing Yi smiled.</p>
  <p>“Mother, how could you think like this? A son will always be the closest with his mother. Even for a person who is wicked beyond redemption, or a fickle and unfaithful person, there have been cases where they divorced their wife, or got plenty of wives and concubines, but as for a mother, there is only one.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui spoke, feeling wronged. Qing Yi couldn’t stop laughing. Looking at Qing Shui, even though he was a Xiantian cultivator, he was still her child. He would forever be the child that is the best, and the one she is most proud of.</p>
  <p>Not long later, people consecutively arrived. Qing Shui directly gave the four Defense-Enhancing Fruits to Qing You, Qing Hu, Qing Bei and Qing Shi, leaving aside two for other uses!</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui planned to send black fish and turtles to the Yu He Inn. Although he had left slightly more than half a month’s share before he left, who knew if it would be sufficient stock. Now that he had been back for a day, it was time to visit Yu He.</p>
  <p>After lunch, Qing Shui rejected anyone who wanted to follow him, and headed towards the Yu He Inn alone. He felt like laughing when he recalled how Qing Bei had pouted her small mouth angrily!</p>
  <p>Yu He Inn had become the biggest and most renowned restaurant in all of Hundred Miles City. The increase in the number of black fish, coupled with the effects of the All Aspect Nourishment Soup, caused the Yu He Inn to face an overwhelming number of customers daily. Although there were still many who did not get to eat them, they could at least eat once if they waited 10 days, or even half a month!</p>
  <p>The All Aspect Nourishment Soup was even more popular than the black fish, especially amongst the guys. There were even those who had travelled from faraway places to Hundred Miles City to have a try of the All Aspects Nourishment Soup. 1 person spread to 10, 10 person spread to 100, the All Aspect Nourishment Soup had long became sort of a divine existence, a must have for all men when they travelled here.</p>
  <p>“Young Miss is upstairs, this way please!” Qing Shui smiled at that beautiful girl he had met the other time. This time it was her again, and she was even blinking cutely as she spoke to him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled at her and headed up the stairway which was all too familiar to him.</p>
  <p>With regards to Yu He, Qing Shui felt very complicated. He wanted to give her more space. On the familiar stairway, memories of the scenes he had shared with Yu He flashed past.</p>
  <p>Let nature takes its course!</p>

 <p>“Mingyue, do you want to take up martial arts?” Qing Shui gave it some thought. In order to take the Golden Pellet, one would need to reach the pinnacle of Houtain. Qing Shui hoped that she would be able to spend a long time beside him, even if it was only the additional 500 years of lifespan a Xiantian cultivator would get.</p>
 <p>“Can I still train?” Mingyue Gelou asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Of course you can. I’m going to help you attain Xiantian. By then, you would have an additional lifespan of 500 years, and as a couple we would be able to bring the little girl around travelling happily.” Qing Shui smiled as he carried the little girl who was already asleep.</p>
 <p>“Xiantian… it’s a wishful thought. Mingyue must thank you even if is merely wishful thinking.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, you’re mine now, what’s there to thank? With your husband around, there’s still some hope to let you attain Xiantian!” Qing Shui smiled sneakily as he took a step forward. The light fragrance of Mingyue Gelou floated to his nose.</p>
 <p>“Ahh!” Looking at Qing Shui, her face turned red.</p>
 <p>“Mingyue!”</p>
 <p>“Mmm!”</p>
 <p>“I’d like to kiss you!”</p>
 <p>Carrying the little girl in his arms, Qing Shui bent down his head and planted a peck on Mingyue Gelou’s petal-like lips, gently sucking on her lips, slowly and softly.</p>
 <p>The soft touch, the slight taste of moistness and sweetness, the smoothness and bounciness… Qing Shui tugged and nibbled on it gently. Slowly, he pried open Mingyue Gelou’s mouth, and sucked on her small little tongue, greedily sucking on the sweet nectar of her mouth.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou’s eyes were half closed, and her pretty face had an expression that seems to be asking for more while appearing reluctant. It really fired Qing Shui up. Finally, Qing Shui let go of the breathless Mingyue Gelou!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard the voices of people outside, and knew that his mother was back. He passed the little girl back to Mingyue Gelou, saying, “I’ll be downstairs. Later, bring our daughter down for food.”</p>
 <p>“Mmm, you go ahead.” Her pretty face looked as if she had been just been through a round of sex, appearing very seductive.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui entered Qing Yi’s room. Seeing Qing Yi, he took out a Golden Ringed Snake Fruit and two Endurance-Enhancing Fruits. “Mother, these are for you!” Qing Shui smiled. Facing Qing Yi, Qing Shui’s smile was always silly and honest.</p>
 <p>“Diamond Fruit!” Qing Yi was slightly astonished when she saw the Defense-Enhancing Fruit. She was no longer as easily astonished these days when Qing Shui brought out extremely precious items.</p>
 <p>Regardless, whether it was the Strength-Enhancing Fruit, the Agility-Enhancing Fruit, or the Defense-Enhancing Fruit, they would all take a hundred years to reach their maturity. Moreover, they could only grow under special environments, thus their value wasn’t considered any less than thousand year old medicinal herbs.</p>
 <p>“What is this golden-colored fruit?” Qing Yi asked curiously when she saw the Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit.</p>
 <p>“This is the Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit, something which can let mother retain her youth for another ten years!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Mother is already old and has no use for it. Keep it for your future wife instead.” Qing Yi smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“There’s no hurry for that!”</p>
 <p>“”Qing Shui, mother has something to discuss with you.” Qing Yi said hesitantly.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead, your son will listen to everything you say.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
 <p>“Mother will not do that. Whatever you do, mother will not interfere with your decision. I just want to ask what are you planning to do about Mingyue?” Qing Yi asked, smiling gently.</p>
 <p>“About this, you can just treat her like your daughter-in-law, what do you think?” Qing Shui scratched his head and said.</p>
 <p>“Sure, why not? Mingyue has led a tough life. Putting aside her past, since you like her, you’ll have to treat her well. Even if you were to have other women in the future, you cannot just abandon her.” Qing Yi said solemnly.</p>
 <p>“Mother knows me best. How could I do something like that?” Qing Shui said happily. He did not expect to get through this so easily. He had thought that he would face objection. Qing Shui only cared about Qing Yi alone. So long as Qing Yi did not object, it wouldn’t matter who else did!</p>
 <p>After all, his status was different now. In addition, Mingyue Gelou was a woman who already had a child. While she was pretty, it would be bad for their reputation.</p>
 <p>“Mother, you’re the most open-minded mother!” Qing Shui had the thinking of two different worlds. So what if it was a woman who had went through a divorce or was a widow? In his previous life, even boy/girlfriends could just get a room and do whatever.</p>
 <p>“Mother, I have something to discuss with you.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, what do you have to discuss with me?” Qing Yi smiled and said, her tone slightly tinged with teasing.</p>
 <p>“That… the rumors about Shi Qingzhuang and myself are real. While it was an accident, I wanted to make things firm. Therefore, I’m letting you know first, so that you are prepared for it.” Qing Shui said awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui, stunned, before she asked with a weird look. “Then what about Wu-shuang?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, about Wu-shuang, we’ll see how it goes!” Qing Shui said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“You rascal. Such a flirt at such a young age. But you’re my son, so I support you. If you have the ability to bring back all the beauties in the world, mother would be happier.” Qing Yi smiled and rubbed Qing Shui on the head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless, but a mother knew her son best!</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, so long as it is not something that brings disgrace, is devoid of conscience or something that heaven and earth will not tolerate, then mother would support you. But, the girl from Shi Clan is already the Situ Clan’s betrothed. Could it be that you’re thinking of snatching?”</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to snatch. The Situ Clan will know to retreat. I will go direct to Shi Clan to propose the marriage. The Shi Clan will directly look for Situ Clan to reject the marriage themselves!” Qing Shui thought about it and said.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, to think that our Qing Clan going to bully others with force too!” Qing Yi sighed.</p>
 <p>“Even if I didn’t propose the marriage, the Shi Clan could still reject the marriage, because I know for a fact that Shi Qingzhuang does not like Situ Bufan at all. With my understanding of her, she is likely to reject the marriage anyway!” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
 <p>“Whatever you choose to do, I feel assured. Go ahead and do whatever you feel like doing!”</p>
 <p>Qing Yi gently hugged Qing Shui, saying, “My son has grown up, and will only grow further away from his mother!”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Qing Yi smiled.</p>
 <p>“Mother, how could you think like this? A son will always be the closest with his mother. Even for a person who is wicked beyond redemption, or a fickle and unfaithful person, there have been cases where they divorced their wife, or got plenty of wives and concubines, but as for a mother, there is only one.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spoke, feeling wronged. Qing Yi couldn’t stop laughing. Looking at Qing Shui, even though he was a Xiantian cultivator, he was still her child. He would forever be the child that is the best, and the one she is most proud of.</p>
 <p>Not long later, people consecutively arrived. Qing Shui directly gave the four Defense-Enhancing Fruits to Qing You, Qing Hu, Qing Bei and Qing Shi, leaving aside two for other uses!</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui planned to send black fish and turtles to the Yu He Inn. Although he had left slightly more than half a month’s share before he left, who knew if it would be sufficient stock. Now that he had been back for a day, it was time to visit Yu He.</p>
 <p>After lunch, Qing Shui rejected anyone who wanted to follow him, and headed towards the Yu He Inn alone. He felt like laughing when he recalled how Qing Bei had pouted her small mouth angrily!</p>
 <p>Yu He Inn had become the biggest and most renowned restaurant in all of Hundred Miles City. The increase in the number of black fish, coupled with the effects of the All Aspect Nourishment Soup, caused the Yu He Inn to face an overwhelming number of customers daily. Although there were still many who did not get to eat them, they could at least eat once if they waited 10 days, or even half a month!</p>
 <p>The All Aspect Nourishment Soup was even more popular than the black fish, especially amongst the guys. There were even those who had travelled from faraway places to Hundred Miles City to have a try of the All Aspects Nourishment Soup. 1 person spread to 10, 10 person spread to 100, the All Aspect Nourishment Soup had long became sort of a divine existence, a must have for all men when they travelled here.</p>
 <p>“Young Miss is upstairs, this way please!” Qing Shui smiled at that beautiful girl he had met the other time. This time it was her again, and she was even blinking cutely as she spoke to him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled at her and headed up the stairway which was all too familiar to him.</p>
 <p>With regards to Yu He, Qing Shui felt very complicated. He wanted to give her more space. On the familiar stairway, memories of the scenes he had shared with Yu He flashed past.</p>
 <p>Let nature takes its course!</p>
