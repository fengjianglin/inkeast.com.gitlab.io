 <p><strong>AST 1336 - Qing Shui's Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling, Little Wuwu, Two Ladies Out From Seclusion</strong></p>
 <p>He should be able to refine Yang Pellets in the short term. This was a variant. Even if he wouldn't be able to get tremendous benefits from Yang Pellets in the short term, there were still family and friends around him. As long as they would hit the requirement to be able to take the Yang Pellets, their abilities could increase tremendously.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, Qing Shui was also getting stronger. However, these things weren't the most important. What that was important was for his power to be stabilized. Furthermore, Qing Shui had used the Life and Death Needles to reinforce himself, bringing up the level of his Nine Yang Golden Body.</p>
 <p>His Nine Yang Golden Body was already at the great perfection stage. He didn't know if it could be brought up to a higher level. The Violet Golden Blood Thread in his bloodstream was now twice as thick as before. The power in his bloodstream had also caused Qing Shui's abilities to be increased by a lot more. However, what he had gained the most was the explosive damaging power he could unleash.</p>
 <p>Today, Qing Shui felt that he wanted to go back to the Western Oxhe Continent to take a look. After all, it had been a long while since he went back to see the Eldest Princess and the others.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui told Soulsearch about it. Right now, despite only being under Qing Shui's guidance for a few months, Soulsearch's medical skills were no longer something which his previous level could be compared to. Of course, the reason he could improve so quickly was also because his Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique was so powerful.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch taught the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique to Qing Shui. At first, Qing Shui didn't want to learn it, but he was unable to reject Soulsearch's kind intentions. A person wouldn't feel troubled from being equipped with too many skills. Moreover, the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique could extend a person's lifespan by three days. To Qing Shui, many things could change within three days.</p>
 <p>Of course, when Qing Shui learned the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique, he made a shocking discovery that it wasn't as simple as what Soulsearch had told him. Diagnosis and extending one's lifespan by three days was merely but the elementary phase.</p>
 <p>It could be because Soulsearch had been doing it all this while but Qing Shui liked to study and try new things. It was only after experimenting that he discovered some other abilities that came with the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling. For example, when the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique was combined with the Soul Search and the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, it could help one break through barriers. It was much stronger than just using the Shield Attack by itself. Furthermore, there wasn't the possibility of one experiencing Qi Deviation.</p>
 <p>When combined with Qing Shui's Force of Rebirth, it could awaken some of the body's vitality and from there, increase one's lifespan.</p>
 <p>However, all these weren't what made Qing Shui the most astonished. He was more astonished that if used it with a hint of force of the Heavenly Dao, the effect would be even stronger. Ever since he stepped into Heavenly Dao, Qing Shui would only think of using up this bit of power in his battles. He hadn't expected that when used in other areas, the effectiveness would be many times stronger.</p>
 <p>Tempering the body... Qing Shui spent the most time on this every day. With the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the nameless Duo Cultivation Technique, he needed to make sure that his foundations were incessantly being reinforced. Only then would he be able to absorb even more abilities.</p>
 <p>The effectiveness was still not bad and he was quite satisfied with his current foundations. The Ancient Strengthening Technique itself was a body tempering technique in the first place and his Nine Yang Golden Body had reached the great perfection stage. He hoped that when the time comes the Yang Pellet would be able to bring him great benefits.</p>
 <p>When Soulsearch heard that Qing Shui was going to leave, he didn't find it strange. During this period of time, Qing Shui would leave for eight to ten days every month and thus he was already used to it.</p>
 <p>When he teleported back, Yehuang Guwu was reading a book and sitting down lazily on a soft couch. She looked so quiet and intelligent, just like a person from a painting. When she turned and saw Qing Shui who had come up to her, she said, "You're back!"</p>
 <p>"What are you looking at so seriously?" Qing Shui sat down next to her, wrapped his arm around her slender waist and sat down.</p>
 <p>"It's nothing. Oh right, Ruyan and Xuan`er have already come out from their seclusion," Yehuang Guwu closed up the book and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"Oh, they're out? How are they?" Qing Shui asked in great surprise.</p>
 <p>"Not bad. They've gotten a lot stronger. But if you can help them, they should be able to undergo a tremendous improvement." Yehuang Guwu smiled and pushed Qing Shui down onto the soft couch, pressing down her wonderful figure onto Qing Shui's body. Qing Shui immediately felt as if his blood was boiling.</p>
 <p>"Demoness!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't hold back and kissed her sexy lips while his hands roamed about on her twin peaks. Yehuang Guwu immediately reacted back to Qing Shui, her tender little tongue entangling with Qing Shui's.</p>
 <p>It had been two months since the previous misunderstanding. Qing Shui had came back twice during this period of time but they didn't act like before. However, they would still touch and kiss each other. Qing Shui had wanted to tell her that they could do it but for some reason, he subconsciously held back this thought.</p>
 <p>Wait a little longer. Good things are worth waiting for.</p>
 <p>He buried his head into her well-rounded twin peaks through her clothes, breathing in her fragrance greedily. Yehuang Guwu looked at Qing Shui and her face became slightly downcast a.</p>
 <p>"Martial Aunt, remember what I told you. You should know about your physique. I have the Nine Yang Physique. Although we can do it now, please wait a little longer. For example, when I reach the False God realm. When that happens, I'll definitely be able to have sex with you without any trouble." Qing Shui knew that he should give her some hope and it was a very large one.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Yehuang Guwu's eyes lit up. She didn't doubt what Qing Shui said. Moreover, her body was very sensitive. In their previous misunderstanding, she got to know that Qing Shui's physique was unique and the heat that came from his body made her feel very comfortable. That was a lethal attraction. It was like the attraction between the north and south poles of magnets.</p>
 <p>It was also due to this reason that when Yehuang Guwu first saw Qing Shui, she did things which made Qing Shui feel as if she was very loose. Her physique had caused her to experience an instinctive feeling towards Qing Shui's physique. However, she still didn't dare to try for fear of bringing harm to Qing Shui. Therefore, no matter what Qing Shui could say, she wouldn't believe it.</p>
 <p>However, she had a dream, hoping that one day, she could really become his. She felt that the chances were very low. Even if his physique wasn't bad, she knew how terrifying her own physique was.</p>
 <p>When she heard what Qing Shui said today, she felt that she could trust it. If Qing Shui could really attain a breakthrough to the False God level, then it'd definitely be possible. Thinking back, she felt that her judgment back then had really been very good. It was because she felt that Qing Shui would become a False God cultivator. He just needed time. At the very least, there was some hope in this.</p>
 <p>"Then it's a promise. When you become a False God cultivator, we'll do it..." Yehuang Guwu said this, her head lowered.</p>
 <p>"Do what? Little Wuwu." Qing Shui grinned evilly as he looked at this extremely mature lady.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu was shocked by Qing Shui's weirdly intimate nickname. It wasn't because she felt that it was very mushy, nor was it because she was embarrassed. She felt a sort of happiness. She hadn't expected for there to be a day when a young man would call her Little Wuwu so intimately. A slight flush appeared on her face as she looked blissfully at Qing Shui, "Qing Shui, I'm really very happy today."</p>
 <p>"In the future, you'll always be happy. I promise to make you the most blissful lady."</p>
 <p>"I believe in you!"</p>
 <p>"Martial Aunt..."</p>
 <p>"I don't like you calling me that." Yehuang Guwu wrapped her arms around Yehuang Guwu's neck and said coquettishly.</p>
 <p>"Little Wuwu..."</p>
 <p>"Too mushy. You can only call me that when there's only the two of us."</p>
 <p>"There's only the two of us here now."</p>
 <p>"Mmmm!"</p>
 <p>"The people from Yehuang Clan have come to look for me." Qing Shui planned to tell this to Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, it's expected for them to look for you. If you really can't reject them, then you can work together with them. Just don't put in too much effort and let them enjoy it a little bit longer," Yehuang Guwu looked at Qing Shui calmly and said. She didn't want Qing Shui to be troubled. After all, Yehuang Clan wasn't an existence he could afford to go up against at this moment.</p>
 <p>"I'm not working with them yet. I got them to do me a favor and I'll only work with them if they manage to get it done. Since they want us to work together, they must show some sincerity. Therefore, they have no choice but to agree. Moreover, there's still you. It won't be long before you'll be able to fight against Yehuang Clan. When the time comes, I'll back you up," Qing Shui said, at ease.</p>
 <p>"It'll probably still take a very long time. Thankfully there's the Tiger Form. If I achieve a higher level in this technique, with my increase in abilities, I should be able to just manage to be on the same standing as the Yehuang Clan." Yehuang Guwu knew that it wasn't that easy to go against a Peak Martial Emperor. Moreover, there was still a False God existence in the Yehuang Clan. Although the person was only an Early False God, it was still a False God.</p>
 <p>False Gods were like gods in the mortal world. It was a qualitative difference. It was said that False God cultivators would all have some powerful Heavenly Technique. A False God with a strength of one million suns could kill over 100 Peak Martial Emperors with a strength of 500,000 suns. This was the power of Heavenly Technique. For example, Heavenly Technique could allow one's defense and attack to increase by a lot for a short period of time. It could allow one to borrow the power of the heaven and earth to unleash some terrifying attacks. Some False God cultivators could instantly call forth dark clouds in the sky, summon lightning and thunder and get those thunderbolts to collectively attack toward one particular location...</p>
 <p>False God cultivators could truly overturn rivers and oceans, condense the air and create mountains. To them, flattening a great mountain was also nothing difficult...</p>
 <p>If Yehuang Guwu wished to fight against Yehuang Clan, then she must at least reach Peak Martial Emperor. That would allow her to rely on the mutated Tiger Form to fight against an Early False God cultivator. However, it wasn't that easy for one to make improvements and achievements in martial arts. Ten years or even decades were extremely short duration for cultivation. A powerful clan like the Yehuang Clan wasn't that easy to eradicate.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Yehuang Guwu was very worried. However, all in all, she was still very happy. Things had been progressing in the best possible way and she should be content. Compared to before, her hopes had been risen by many times more.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui met up with Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan, it was already the next day. These two ladies went through a tremendous change in the charm which they exuded. It was an aura of a powerful expert and had a slightly sharp feeling. Qing Shui knew that this was due to the fact that they had yet to master their newly gained power. It would all be fine after some time. When the time came, they would experience a slight change in the charm they exuded and wouldn't let others feel as if they were making a showy display of their powers.</p>
 <p>Having not met Qing Shui for several months, Yu Ruyan ran up to him and hugged him tightly. Even Qing Shui could sense her yearning for him. He missed Yu Ruyan a lot as well and only let go of her after a short while had passed. Yu Ruyan smiled and walked over to Tantai Xuan, looked at her and said, "Do you want to hug him as well? He belongs to you now too."</p>
 <p>"I don't care for that!" After all, Tantai Xuan hadn't had much close contact with Qing Shui and was still very much reserved. She felt very anxious. If it was any other thing, she wouldn't feel this anxious. However, she would feel very frantic toward a relationship between man and woman. She would feel anxiety, anticipation and a bit at a loss.</p>
