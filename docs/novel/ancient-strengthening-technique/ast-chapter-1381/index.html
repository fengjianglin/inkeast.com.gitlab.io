 <p><strong>AST 1381 - Linghu Tui, Eight Trigrams Golden Turtle Formation, Battle</strong></p>
 <p>Linghu Tui was very worried that Qing Shui would say those words. However, he had the strong feeling that the possibility of Qing Shui saying those would be very high. However, he was still hoping to hear a surprised answer.</p>
 <p>If a man, an outstanding man, were to be without the function of a man, then being able to stay alive itself was a kind of strength. This was especially true for those men who had no hopes of recovering. Qing Shui could understand his unease.</p>
 <p>"It can be cured. I can help you connect your meridian channel directly," Qing Shui smiled and said. He didn't let Linghu Tui experience the agony and gave the answer straight away.</p>
 <p>It was almost impossible for the physicians in this world to connect broken meridian channels. They could only do simple healing and thus there was a very high possibility for people to become cripples the moment they experience problems with their meridian channels. However, this place was unlike Qing Shui's previous life. For example, if an illness in Qing Shui's previous life was assessed to be incurable, then people would definitely think the person is a liar for saying that he would be able to cure the patient.</p>
 <p>Things were different in this world. There were too many strange and amazing people and there were no such thing as incurable disease. It was only a matter of whether the individual had the capability to cure an illness and not of there being an incurable disease. Therefore, when Qing Shui said that he could reconnect meridian channels, what Qing Shui felt was more of surprise than of suspecting if Qing Shui was lying.</p>
 <p>It was because he knew that he wasn't worth being lied to. Unless he had recovered and his body and cultivation went back to their level they were at previously, then there would be changes and he would be someone that was worth being plotted against. Right now, although he was no longer on the same level as before, he felt that he still had an eye for people. This young physician here didn't seem to harbor any evil intentions toward him. It was just that he had no idea why Qing Shui would want to help him.</p>
 <p>"Can it really be done?" When Linghu Tui heard this reply, he was so excited that he felt that bellowing out loudly.</p>
 <p>"I can give you treatment immediately and your condition will be fine after today." Qing Shui smiled and took out this Gold Needles.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Life and Death Needles weren't always used. He only used them in special circumstances. Other than being used for saving people, the Life and Death Needles were also especially domineering when used to kill.</p>
 <p>Linghu Tui didn't say much but just waited excitedly for Qing Shui's treatment.</p>
 <p>A large part of Linghu Tui's cultivation had been crippled and his Tianyang meridian channel was broken. He was basically unable to function as a man in this lifetime, no matter what cultivation level he reached. For a normal man, if he were to lose his basic function as a man, he wouldn't be happy no matter how high a position he reached. He might even be happier remaining an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>For some people, when their cultivation level reached a certain level, their condition would improve for the better. Therefore, there would be some organizations who would go to the extreme to push their members to cultivate. The effects were quite good. However, the disciples would tend to live a tough life, being unable to sneak some sex even if they wished to. They could only enjoy for a short while after they had attained a breakthrough in the cultivation and regained their abilities to function as a man. Then, the cycle would repeat as they become impotent once again.</p>
 <p>Although Linghu Tui's cultivation was crippled, his foundations were still there. As long as his fighting spirit was lit up, he could return to how he was in the past or even surpass his own self. After all, the circumstances he had landed in was like he was given a new lease on life. That was, if Qing Shui could treat him.</p>
 <p>The duration of the treatment wasn't very long. With Qing Shui's abilities, he could tackle the condition at its roots, allowing what that seemed to be an incurable disease to heal very quickly. Linghu Tui was no fool. He could sense that he was healing but he wouldn't feel that this wasn't a precious encounter. He couldn't even remember how many physicians he himself had found in the past.</p>
 <p>Linghu Tui was very agitated as he sensed the changes to and reactions in, his body. His heart was so agitated that it was as if it was going to jump out at any moment. This was how it was for all people. Things that one regained after having been lost once were even more important.</p>
 <p>A gush of heat currently continued to circulate in his body. That part of his body which had no sensation at all for so many years became heated. This surprise made him even more confident in Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>This wasn't the only thing. The power in his Dantian was also gathering. Because his Tianyang meridian channel had broken, the most primary meridian channel for a man had lost its effect and thus his cultivation suffered a big blow. The importance of the Tianyang meridian channel wouldn't lose out to the Ren Meridian and the Du Meridian.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui drew out the gold needles, Linghu Tui realized that his lower part had risen to form a tent. At this moment, he didn't feel any embarrassment but on the contrary, felt overwhelmed with surprise. He seemed to also have gotten a lot stronger and his obese body had also slimmed down by a lot.</p>
 <p>"It's fine now. There are really some things that a man cannot afford to lose," Qing Shui shook his head and said.</p>
 <p>"Miraculous Physician, why did you choose to help me?" Linghu Tui asked, feeling both happy and curious.</p>
 <p>"There's no reason why. Alright, it's late. You should be going back," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Miraculous Physician, you're the one who had given me my life. I'll work hard to gain some status in the Linghu Clan. If you were to need any help, no matter how tough it is, I, Linghu Tui, won't even frown." Linghu Tui said as he left, sounding very sincere.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and didn't say anything. Some things couldn't be expressed through words but must be expressed through actions. Therefore, he was very approving of Linghu Tui's decision. He only said one line and didn't try to get into Qing Shui's good books or keep trying to show that he was trying to pay him back in kind. Moreover, Qing Shui had never thought that Linghu Tui could help him in anything. Qing Shui didn't need other people's help. Of course, if friends were to help him, he would still be very welcoming.</p>
 <p>Linghu Tui left but Qing Shui left a word, "Wu`er, take good care of Sister Su. I'll head out for a while."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then left.</p>
 <p>Standing in midair in the night sky, Qing Shui looked around and said, "Since you're here, then don't be hiding yourselves. Come out!"</p>
 <p>There were no motion after Qing Shui had said anything. No one came out either. However, Qing Shui didn't say anything else but took out a 10,000 Years Coldsteel Bead and shot it out toward an area of dark clouds.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A crisp sound resonated for a very long distance. Although it was a bright sound, it also broke the silence in the night sky. A figure stumbled out. Although Qing Shui's physical strength wasn't very strong, the hidden weapon he sent out was definitely very powerful. Even a Peak Grade One False God would suffer greatly from it.</p>
 <p>After one of them came out, he was gradually followed by over ten more people. All of them were wearing loosely fitted cultivator clothes which had no symbols on them. When Qing Shui saw this, the killing intent in his eyes grew even stronger than before. The other party had came with the intention to kill.</p>
 <p>"Do it! Kill!"</p>
 <p>A low voice rang out and more than ten people dashed out toward Qing Shui with an overwhelming aura. Qing Shui felt very solemn. he didn't know who these people were but he had the feeling that the only ones in the continent's capital who wanted to deal with him would be the Yelang Clan. However, Yelang Qiankun didn't seem to be a despicable person who would go back on his words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't give it much thought and dashed out toward the person charging toward him.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Laws!</p>
 <p>A faint layer of cage came down. In the Nine Palace, Qing Shui had a powerful grasp in the control and in the power.</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't hold back.</p>
 <p>Shadowless Paragon!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's silhouette moved one again and instantly appeared before a person. The Primordial Flame Dragon Whip lashed out on a person's head.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>Even with the defense from the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, it wasn't enough to withstand such destructive power. Speed was power. Moreover, Qing Shui's Primordial Flame Dragon Whip was made from primordial flames. After the people had been weakened by Qing Shui, most of them were only left with Early Grade Two False God level and those who were even weaker were only about Grade One False God level.</p>
 <p>Instant kill!</p>
 <p>"Get into formation!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's movement was very fast, instantly killing one of them. His opponents' reactions weren't slow and they immediate got into formation.</p>
 <p>Over ten people moved quickly, forming the shape like the eight trigrams. A circle of faint glow encompassed them.</p>
 <p>Eight Trigrams Golden Turtle Formation！</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this formation, he was also stunned. This was a huge turtle that was several hundred of meters in size, exuding faint golden glow... It appeared as if it was a small mountain.</p>
 <p>To think that their abilities had increased by over three times.</p>
 <p>For some formations, different people would bring out different prowess. This formation here could directly allow these people to be united as one, with their prowess getting close to 14 million sun. This was even after their prowess had been weakened.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Golden Armor and thus there were no problems with his defense. Furthermore, he still had the Arhat Rosary Beads and the Nine Continents Mountain. Therefore, he didn't panic. However, there was a need for him to break through this formation.</p>
 <p>The greatest trait of turtle-shaped formations was that they had superb defense. Therefore, it wouldn't be easy for him to break through this formation. Furthermore, this golden turtle wouldn't just willing be hit. It would retaliate.</p>
 <p>Whipped!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lashed out his Primordial Flame Dragon Whip on that golden colored turtle shell formed from Origin Qi. A crisp sound rang out but there weren't many changes.</p>
 <p>Old Turtle Sucking Pearl!</p>
 <p>The huge golden turtle abruptly opened its mouth wide, its huge head stretched out like a flexible snake. A mysterious power caused Qing Shui to be uncontrollably sucked in toward its mouth.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dare to take any risks. With a thought, the Nine Continents Mountain was summoned and it smashed toward that turtle's mouth. Qing Shui took this opportunity to dodge. He wasn't very worried. The depletion from sustaining a formation was huge.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Laws!</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Abruptly smashing down!</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>Although the Seal of Xuantian wasn't very strong now, it still had a tremendous impact and was very domineering. Compared to how it was before, the Seal of Xuantian had also attained a breakthrough and had quite a good prowess. However, it could only work as a support.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly thought of the bloodthirsty demonic vines. It's ability to entangle and its flexibility was many times stronger than his. Would it be possible for him to use his bloodthirsty demonic vines to entangle the huge golden turtle?</p>
 <p>Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</p>
 <p>The turtle had its speed reduced due to the Nine Palace Laws and to top it up, turtle-typed beasts tend to not have fast speed to begin with. Of course, there were also turtle species which excelled in speed, such as the Lightning Turtle, the Flowing Light Turtle...</p>
 <p>That old turtle that was with the Demon Lord should also be one that excelled in fast speed...</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The huge bloodthirsty demonic vines sent out explosive force and in that instant, the brilliance exuded was really breathtaking. It was an intoxicating feeling.</p>
 <p>The huge golden colored Origin Qi turtle was entangled and the bloodthirsty demonic vines which headed straight up into the clouds wrapped many layers around it into a huge dumpling. Although its sharp reverse spikes couldn't bring down its opponents, the bloody and eerie feeling it exuded still let one feel the shivers.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the bloodthirsty demonic vines had completely entangled the huge golden turtle, Qing Shui felt very happy. It was because with this, he would be able to stand his ground if he were to encounter a cultivator of this level. After all, that Paragon Strike in from his Paragon Heavenly Technique could only be used once. It was how like now, when against a power of the huge golden turtle's level, he wondered how the Paragon Strike would fare.</p>
 <p>Test it out?</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui thought of this, he circulated his power without any hesitation and attacked with the Paragon Strike.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed that the little golden armored person in his Dantian swung the Big Dipper Sword in his hands with the same movement that Qing Shui waved with his hand. A brilliant seven-colored longsword struck out toward the huge golden turtle that was wrapped up by the bloodthirsty demonic vines. It carried with it a terrifying confining power.</p>
 <p>An attack which couldn't be avoided...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He hadn't expected that this was an attack that was sure to hit.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Although this sword attack didn't slash apart the golden turtle's shell, the glow on the golden shell became a lot dimmer and even had a hint of a tremble.</p>
