 <p><strong>AST 675 - Saint Jade Poisonous Pearl</strong></p>
 <p>The kind of feeling Qing Shui had caused him to skip a heartbeat. He felt unusually attached. He realized that he had grown to like Lady Duanmu, at least for this moment, this was the thought that he had. It was a kind of feeling which couldn’t be described by words, it felt really beautiful and great.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui came back to his senses, he noticed that he was holding Lady Duanmu’s soft hands. What he was surprised about was that he felt calm even after finding out that he was doing it. On the other hand, Lady Duanmu seemed like she didn’t want to call him on it.</p>
 <p>“Be careful on your way back!” Qing Shui said gently.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui boldly went forward and embraced her. Aside from that, he didn’t really do anything else. It was just like a hug between friends. At the moment, their two hearts were really close to each other, so much so that Qing Shui could feel her heartbeat.</p>
 <p>Upon feeling her soft delicate body, Qing Shui felt a sense of peace in his heart. In addition to that, there was her unique fragrance which made it felt particularly good during this hot summer. It was a cool and relaxing feeling, a kind of beautiful atmosphere.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who was standing on the back of the Fire bird felt really depressed as he saw Lady Duanmu off until she disappeared from his sight. Prior to this, he had always thought that Lady Duanmu was an extreme beauty. If she hadn’t given birth to Duanmu Lingshuang, she would have been considered a youngster.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he wasn’t an imprudent person. As long as one didn’t cross a line, he would find it really hard to let go of his relationship with any particular person. Taking Zhu Qing for example, despite the circumstances they were in, Qing Shui still chose to accept her.</p>
 <p>The only exception was Elder Yun from Feng Clan. That woman was the only person whom Qing Shui wanted to completely give up on. As of now, he still hasn’t really planned on visiting her. If it wasn’t for him, would she have acted this way too? At that time, Qing Shui realized that it was the woman’s first time. Even so, Qing Shui would still occasionally think about her.</p>
 <p>As for Lady Duanmu, despite Qing Shui being a person who has had countless near-death experiences and a person who has lived two different lives, he was still a bit clueless when it came to facing her. Not only was he a lot younger than Lady Duanmu, he was almost about the same age as her daughter.</p>
 <p>Not only did Lady Duanmu feel that this situation was out of the question, even Qing Shui himself found it a bit thorny. He rubbed his forehead and instructed the Fire Bird to head back to Di Clan following the original route. He planned to think about this again in the future because for all he knew, this problem might eventually end up solved on its own.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In just a short while, the Di Clan had become the mightiest clan, which no one dared to provoke in Seven Stars Country. As of now, people from everywhere, regardless of whether they already knew each other from before, all came forward to congratulate them with the intention of establishing a relationship.</p>
 <p>This was the way the world worked. Each and every one of them pretended like they cared deeply for Di Clan and acted like they’re really close to them. Yet during the battles, none had shown up to provide aid.</p>
 <p>About all of these, Di Clan could only act like they didn’t know anything about it and pretended to accept. Di Clan obviously didn’t have enough strength to hold up the Seven Stars Country at the moment. Even if they had it now, it didn’t mean that they would still have it in the future. Hence, Di Clan would still have to rule Seven Stars City along with them.</p>
 <p>It’s better to provoke a gentleman than to provoke a cheap person. Regardless of how powerful one was, there would come a day when their boat would sink. Even cheap people would turn out to be successful one day. When that happened, it would be the time for the people who have had born grudges with them to suffer.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui returned, the people from Di Clan had already started becoming occupied. Already, those people couldn’t wait to approach them. Di Clan had to comply since they couldn’t upset everyone. Qing Shui on the other hand, didn’t care about it. He used the excuse of not feeling well to avoid meeting anyone who wanted to see him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was looking through the battle rewards with Di Chen and Di Qing. It was the things that were collected from Ten Thousand Poisons Sect and Sima Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw his own Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb and a few poisonous beasts that died in it. He immediately put away the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb and dissected the poisonous beasts. He left behind a few poisonous pills, poisonous bones, blood and skin for the purpose of using them to draw poisonous talismans and mix poisons.</p>
 <p>The majority of Ten Thousand Poisons Sect’s collection was related to poisons. Poisonous pills, medicines, grass, flowers, beasts and so on. Di Clan said that these were all for Qing Shui, the reason being that they didn’t have the slightest knowledge about poisons and dared not keep it. They wouldn’t have the opportunity to enjoy it despite how good they were. Even if they had known how to use it, they wouldn’t hesitate to give it to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the right to it. Not only that, they were also really keen on letting Qing Shui get it as long as Qing Shui could recover. Qing Shui didn’t refuse them. That was how he ended up here.</p>
 <p>The majority of the collections were from Ten Thousand Poisons Sect. The brocade boxes of different sizes as well as medicinal herbs were scattered all around the room. Reason being that some of the things there shouldn’t be interacted with directly.</p>
 <p>Heartbroken Flower!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui randomly picked up a box. To his surprise, there were a few decent poisonous flowers and Heartbroken Flowers. The flower was just as the name stated. Whoever ate it would end up getting their heart broken.</p>
 <p>Rain-Mist Flowers, Bloody Qi Grass, White-Worm Grass, Thousand Years Snake-Marrow Grass, Thousand Years Scarlet Crane Top, Emotion Flowers, Thousand Years Tiger-Wolf Grass, Turtle-dove Pill, Turtle-Dove Blood, Two Thousand Years Poisonous Wood Arrow Venomous Wolf Flowers...</p>
 <p>Among all of these, there were also a few poisonous medicines that were more than two thousand years old. Qing Shui looked through it randomly and took some of them. It wasn’t anything much, he was just taking whatever entered his sight. It felt really good to collect rewards. The feeling of not knowing what one might find was really exciting.</p>
 <p>“Mn!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened up a box which looked distinctly different compared to other brocade boxes and got shocked when he saw the content within it. It was a black jade pearl that looked like an eye.</p>
 <p>It looked really similar to an eye when looked at closely. It was really unusual and was sparklingly black. Yuan Su on the other hand made a weird noise. This resulted in Qing Shui glancing towards her in confusion.</p>
 <p>“You know what this is?” Qing Shui asked Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>“Saint Jade Poisonous Pearl !”</p>
 <p>“What’s it used for?”</p>
 <p>“Hey, it’s the Saint Grade Medicinal Pill for a Poison Beast. There is a huge possibility that it could help a poisonous beast to mutate, grow, and increase its toxicity by a 100%.”Yuan Su explained slowly.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui first heard its name, he already had the feeling that it would be a valuable item. In addition to that, the abundant spiritual energy which he felt when he first opened it further convinced him that his assumption was right.</p>
 <p>“This is more than enough, this trip is worth it.” Qing Shui happily put away the Saint Jade Poisonous Pearl . This thing was considerably precious to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He continued looking around while throwing those that he regarded as useful into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>During the process, he managed to find a few more decent things. But compared to the Saint Jade Poisonous Pearl, they were greatly inferior. They didn’t really pique Qing Shui’s interest.</p>
 <p>He put away those that he found decent. As for the useless ones, Qing Shui threw them away immediately. Even though Ten Thousand Poisons Sect was a large sect, it didn’t necessarily mean that they wouldn’t have trash. On the contrary, there was even more trashes than stuff that’s actually useful. Truly valuable stuff would often come in limited quantity. How much something was worth was partially based on its rarity.</p>
 <p>Seeing as it was almost evening, Di Xian approached them and asked them to go have dinner. The little brat was really charming. She constantly had the title auntie and uncle hanging on her mouth. She didn’t hide the slightest bit of her admiration for Qing Shui any time she looked at him.</p>
 <p>Almost everyone from Di Clan arrived. They were all really happy after knowing that Qing Shui was fine. No matter what, Qing Shui was Di Clan’s son-in-law. Not only was he half a Di Clan member, he even represented the entire Di Clan.</p>
 <p>It was a big drinking party. Everyone enjoyed themselves with the dishes that were prepared while Qing Shui became the busiest person among them. He had to constantly drink wines with the people from Di Clan. Luckily, he managed to maintain his soberness.</p>
 <p>The meal lasted all the way until nighttime. The crowd became less and less. Qing Shui felt that it was time for him to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to cultivate for a while. I’ll be back a bit later.” Qing Shui smiled at Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“You can come back whenever you like.” Di Chen responded before turning around with a smile and leaving.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and walked to a spot with fewer people. After that, he immediately entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The place which he chose wasn’t too far away from his room.</p>
 <p>The many things which happened within a day made Qing Shui felt really tired mentally. As soon as he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he laid down, cut off all thoughts and slept.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui woke up, it had been around eight hours. No matter how tired Qing Shui felt, he normally wouldn’t sleep for more than eight hours. The most important part about sleeping was to let the spirit rest. As long as the spirit didn’t feel tired, no matter how exhausted one’s body felt, they would still be able to endure. It was exactly like what people usually knew as “mental strength”. Mental strength was also spiritual strength. Once someone’s spirit was tired, they wouldn’t be able to do anything even if their body wasn’t. They would be left with no choice but to rest.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui arranged the medicinal herbs that he tossed into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and started cultivating. He went through all of the essential things that he needed to cultivate everyday like usual. As of now, Qing Shui’s Hidden Weapons had taken yet another huge leap. This caused Qing Shui to feel incomparably happy, after all, to Qing Shui, these Hidden Weapons were also one of his considerably powerful techniques.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really happy to see himself being able to create Primordial Flame which was about 66 centimeters tall. There was an insanely powerful energy contained within it.</p>
 <p>Compress!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Primordial Flame and slowly compressed it to concentrate the energy within. The 66 centimeter tall Primordial Flame was compressed all the way to about 33 centimeters. At this moment, Qing Shui could feel the benefits of having strong mental strength.</p>
 <p>He continued compressing it until it was about the size of an adult man’s fist. It could no longer be compressed any further, nevertheless, Qing Shui was already really satisfied with it. He could clearly feel the terrifying power of the Primordial Flame.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui flung it into the sky.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The destructive power of the fireball was still able to be felt the instant it exploded. More importantly, it’s combustibility had gone up two fold compared to back then when Qing Shui was facing off against the Marrow Nibbling Worms.</p>
 <p>The stroke of luck Qing Shui had this time made him feel that he wouldn’t have as hard a time the next time he faced someone like the Sect Leader of the Ten Thousand Poison Sect again. The Primordial Fireball should also be able to force them to retreat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee and the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly. This time, not only had the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee been really helpful, it had even brought him two formidable demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>What truly surprised Qing Shui was the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly. Originally, the Realm of the Violet Jade could only grow plants, aquatic animals and amphibians. Of course, there were also demonic beasts which shared close connections with Qing Shui, for instance, the demonic beasts that the Realm of the Violet Jade rewarded as a result of ascending up a new grade.</p>
 <p>But how did the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly manage to survive within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal? It wasn’t an aquatic animal, nor was it an amphibian. Could it have something to do with the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee?</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui wasn’t able to figure out the reason for it, he stopped thinking about it and took out the Saint Jade Poisonous Pearl . Qing Shui intended to feed this to the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee, but before this, he planned to first take a look at the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly.</p>
 <p>The Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies were two meters long. One of them was colored gold whereas the other one was colored silver. In terms of physical appearance, they looked extremely beautiful. Their body was soft yet tough. Their action felt gentle yet swift. They were barely considered to be Martial Saint Grade mutated beasts.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui truly looked forward to was the mysterious “solidifying” ability. It was too insane!</p>
