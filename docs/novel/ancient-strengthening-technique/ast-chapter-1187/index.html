 <p><strong>AST 1187 - Battling Tian Jiange! Taichi hands, Skysword hands!</strong></p>
 <p>“Let me fight this battle!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui spoke out unhurriedly. Everyone was shocked when they heard him say this. This was because the Fifth Princess had already mentioned that Yan Leng would definitely lose if he was to go up the stage. To think that this man would still dare to say something like this after what she said. This man must be really certain that he would win.</p>
 <p>Everyone looked at Qing Shui in shock. Even though they knew that Qing Shui was extraordinary, they didn’t know his actual strength. The only thing they knew about him was that he had exceptional talent in forging.</p>
 <p>“I am confident that I will win,” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>The Fifth and Seventh Princesses as well as the people from the Yan Clan looked at Qing Shui in amazement. This fight was the most crucial fight, they couldn’t afford the slightest carelessness.</p>
 <p>Each clan could look for an external help that was under the age of a hundred years old. This was precisely what the Fifth Princess had come over for. However, she never would have expected that Qing Shui would suddenly appear midway.</p>
 <p>“Are you aware of who the Yu Clan would send to battle?” The Seventh Princess knitted her brows and looked at Qing Shui. She seemed to be a bit upset with Qing Shui’s arrogance. Currently, Qing Shui could be said to be egotistical in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. I am just stating my opinion. Brother Yan lets me fight, i’ll do it. I have no objections even if he chooses someone else to do it,” Qing Shui said casually.</p>
 <p>He didn’t like the expression the Seventh Princess showed. Nevertheless, he still answered carefreely.</p>
 <p>The Fifth Princess knitted her brows. After a while, she said unhurriedly, “The opponent is a young expert from Heaven Secrets Academy.He turns hundred this year and is just able to particpate. He is really strong and he shares a decent relationship with Third Prince.”</p>
 <p>“Is his name Tian Jiange?” Yan Jinyu asked softly.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Sister Jinyu, I assume that you too, know of his strength?” Seventh Princess said.</p>
 <p>“He is an elite disciple of Heaven Secrets Academy. Most importantly, he is exactly a hundred years old this year. No one younger than him will be a match against him,” Yan Jinyu let out a sigh as she answered.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui actually didn’t really feel anything from it. He smiled and said, “Well then, do you guys have a suitable candidate?”</p>
 <p>“We managed to find one. However, there is only a ten percent chance he will beat Tian Jiange.” The Fifth Princess said bitterly.</p>
 <p>“Even though he only has a ten percent chance of winning, he has a killer move. Once he uses it, there is a thirty percent chance he will be able to heavily injure his opponent. However, the impact of this killer move is really significant. Regardless of whether it will be able to heavily injure his opponent, he will still end up a cripple for three years,” the Seventh Princess carried on and said.</p>
 <p>“So even with the killer move included, there is only a thirty percent chance of winning. The hope is too small.” Yan Yangchi currently felt really conflicted.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, you have seen it too… This person called Tian Jiange seems to be really strong. Second brother supports your decision to go up. But we don’t want anything to happen to you.” Yan Yangchen said seriously.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I promised Sister Qingyu that I would help her fight a match. I am fine with whoever you decide to send. But I guarantee my chance of winning will definitely be higher than that person.” Qing Shui responded with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Since Brother Qing Shui has said that, we will support you. It’s just that this match is a death match. Hence, we really wish that you are certain you want to take part in it. We don’t want anything to happen to you,” Yan Yangchi said with her teeth gritted.</p>
 <p>“Haha, that’s great then. Let me fight this one. Oh yeah, Sister Qingyu, if anything happens to Tian Jiange, will Heaven Secrets Academy come and seek trouble?” Qing Shui found it necessary to ask this question.</p>
 <p>“No, this is a normal match. Heaven Secrets Academy will not seek trouble. The worst thing that could happen is that the friends or relatives of Tian Jiange might come and look for you. They wouldn’t do anything in the open but you wouldn’t be at peace anyways,” said Yan Jinyu after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a little depressed upon hearing this. But in any case, he couldn’t care too much about it at the moment. To him, this was also a great opportunity.</p>
 <p>The Fifth and Seventh Princesses didn’t say anything upon seeing this. They left after saying a few sentences to Yan Yangchi. Just before they left, the Seventh Princess turned around and looked at Qing Shui, “If you manage to win this match, I will help you with one thing, as long as it’s something that is within my capability.”</p>
 <p>Time was up. This time, the Yan Clan was step onto the stage first. Qing Shui rose into the air as he walked onto the arena. It didn’t seem like he was moving fast, but he had arrived within a few blinks of an eye.</p>
 <p>“He is so young, is he someone from Yan Clan?”</p>
 <p>“No, he should be the person that they asked for help.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, both sides can call for help. It’s just that the person helping them cannot be older than a hundred year old.”</p>
 <p>“This young man looks quite handsome, I wonder if he is strong?”</p>
 <p>“He is the last one to come out. Even if you use your leg and think, will he possibly be weak?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already standing on the arena. However, there was no movements from the Yu Clan. The participant coming out later could choose to come out fifteen minutes after the first participant arrived.</p>
 <p>And now, it’s very likely that the opponent was trying to neglect Qing Shui. Qing Shui faintly closed his eyes. He stood there like a 10,000 Years Pine Tree, imposing yet motionless, till the point that others felt like he was petrified.</p>
 <p>“The Yu Clan can really pretend!”</p>
 <p>“What are they trying to do!”</p>
 <p>“Lower your volume. I have heard rumors that the external help the Yu Clan invited is quite extraordinary.”</p>
 <p>“Really? Brother do you know who he is?”</p>
 <p>“He seems to be an expert from Heaven Secrets Academy.”</p>
 <p>“If that is true, it’s safe to assume that this young man is done for.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>A figure appeared. He was wearing white clothing. His hands behind his back as he approached the arena. Every step he took was like a profound mystery. This person looked equally young and was as handsome as a painting.</p>
 <p>All along, this person had a faint smile on his face. Something suddenly appeared in Qing Shui’s mind. He was an expert from Heaven Secrets Academy, so how did the Third Prince manage to find him?</p>
 <p>Heaven Secrets Academy was a lot stronger than Great Yu Dynasty. Normally, elites from Heaven Secrets Academy wouldn’t even bat an eye at a Prince.</p>
 <p>On top of the arena not far away from Qing Shui, this young man was greeted with cheers from the audience below. It’s not known whether he was cheered because of his handsome looks or his reputation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also observing this man. He already knew that this man was a hundred years old. However, he looked like he was almost the same age as himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. If it wasn’t for the double breakthrough in his Roc Form significantly boosting his strength, things would really be terrible today. The strength within the continent was indeed really profound. Just how powerful was the Heaven Secrets Academy?</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui! Please advise me!”</p>
 <p>“Tian Jiange, I’m glad to meet you too!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a bit shocked by what Tian Jiange said. Nevertheless, he still smiled and said, “I’m really glad to know you too!”</p>
 <p>“Well then, let’s try out each others skills today. No matter who wins, as long as we manage to survive, let’s be friends. Are you okay with that?” Tian Jiange smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Sure!” like before, Qing Shui responded calmly. He then lifted up his leg slightly, arriving beside Tian Jiange in a flash.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange squinted, moving his body subtly and raising his right hand.</p>
 <p>A silver aura appeared in his palm. He immediately pressed toward Qing Shui’s wrist.</p>
 <p>Taichi Golden Qi!</p>
 <p>A golden light flashed across Qing Shui’s palm. He abruptly struck towards Tian Jiange’s wrist at a faster speed. The scene looked really exquisite. The two used very mysterious footwork. From an outsider’s perspective, they looked like two shadows. Only powerful warriors would be able to see their movements.</p>
 <p>Cloud hand!</p>
 <p>Single Whip!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hand seemed slow but was actually fast as he attacked Tian Jiange’s acupoints. Qing Shui used the Roc Spreading Wings and Roaming Dragon Steps as he attacked his opponent with the Nine Palace Positioning. His hands were like nature itself, giving off a majestic aura like a huge net. It was so densely packed that one would not be able to find any openings in it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was aware that Tian Jiange didn’t really pay any attention to him previously. He also wouldn’t have a favorable impression just because of his words from before.</p>
 <p>Seeing as the opponent was unarmed, Qing Shui wanted to make him suffer a little.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange’s heart was currently fluctuating like a surging wave. Even though he didn’t have any weapons now,by using his hands as replacements for a sword to unleash the Skysword hands, it already held formidable might. He never expected that there would be a day where he was pressured by a similarly unarmed youngster.</p>
 <p>Originally, he thought that he would be able to win the match without any weapons. He was an elite disciple of Heaven’s Academy and a well-known figure among people his age. Currently he was facing off against someone younger than him, of course he wouldn’t pay any attention to him.</p>
 <p>Even though he previously felt that his opponent was decent, the aura he emitted was far weaker than his own. However, he was presently getting forced back by his opponent instead. The primary reason was because his opponent was aiming for his acupoints.</p>
 <p>It was a close-combat fight. Qing Shui’s hand was so fast that it dazzled the crowd. Both of his hands contained an extremely mysterious force. Even at the time when they collided with Tian Jiange, even if his fists weren’t that strong, they could still sweep away the opponent’s hands. From time to time, he would take advantage of an opening and strike the opponent. Tian Jiange on the other hand, would try his best to prevent Qing Shui from hitting his acupoints.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A force that wasn’t extremely strong struck Tian Jiange and immediately blew him backwards. The two seemed to share a mutual understanding with each other.</p>
 <p>“I am sorry. I underestimated you just now. I will get serious now. You have to be carefull too!” Tian Jiange said seriously while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded.</p>
 <p>Everyone below was in shock when they saw Tian Jiange being blown away!</p>
 <p>“I can’t see clearly. But it seemed like the person invited by the Yu Clan is at a disadvantage!”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, he actually got blown back!”</p>
 <p>“Brother, do you think Qing Shui will be able to beat Tian Jiange?” Yan Jinyu asked softly.</p>
 <p>“Qingyu, based on your understanding of Qing Shui, what kind of person do you think he is?” Yan Yangchi smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“His heart is as huge as a mountain, yet he is calm like water. He isn’t arrogant, nor does he give up easily. He is very adamant and he always manages to keep his calm in solving problems.” By the time Yan Jinyu said all of this, she even stunned herself.</p>
 <p>“We have truly underestimated him. He should be even stronger than this. This is weird, what clan actually managed to nurture such a monster? Furthermore, he is very skillful at forging.” Yan Yangchi frowned. However, he was still really happy.</p>
 <p>He came from the Five Continents. Yan Yangchi shook his head as he thought about all of this. The world truly had too many hidden experts.</p>
 <p>“Fourth brother, to think that this person is this strong. Since when has there been such a strong person among the young generation in Great Yu Dynasty?” Fifth Princess looked at the stage in shock.</p>
 <p>“Third brother had calculated everything, yet he was unable to predict someone like this appearing. We will see and only talk about it after he beats Tian Jiange. You haven’t seen the extent of Tian Jiange’s strength,” the Fourth Prince said calmly.</p>
 <p>“He has truly managed to hide himself well. After the tournament finishes, I will go take a look at his blacksmith store. He had given me a 30% percent discount on the items.” The Seventh Princess smiled.</p>
 <p>The Fourth Prince and Fifth Princess simply smiled silently</p>
 <p>“Where did this little brat come from?” the Third Prince had an unsightly expression on his face.</p>
 <p>“He is a blacksmith. During all this time, his blacksmith store has become quite well-known. I think it’s called the Firecloud Blacksmith Store,” a middle-aged man beside the Third Prince said softly.</p>
