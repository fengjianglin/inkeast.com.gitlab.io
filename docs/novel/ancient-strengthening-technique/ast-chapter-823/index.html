 <p><strong>AST 823 - Disrespect, Disparity in Strength, Life Hanging by a thread</strong></p>
 <p>As Qing Shui entered the familiar area, his strength recovered completely. This place wasn’t affected by the pressure of Flowerfruit Mountain. As he lifted up his head, he saw the enormous old turtle. The old turtle looked as serene as always, just like a mountain. However, upon meeting it again this time, Qing Shui felt that the previous intimacy had been eliminated.</p>
 <p>However, what made Qing Shui panic was that with his current ability, he was still unable to feel the extent of the old turtle’s ability. Nevertheless, he was certain that the old turtle was a lot stronger than him.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui noticed the turtle, he also happened to see that the old turtle was also looking at him. Qing Shui could tell that from its large eyes that it was elated to see him.</p>
 <p>“Young man, you came!”</p>
 <p>An old yet solid voice sounded in Qing Shui’s mind.</p>
 <p>This startled Qing Shui. He was aware that the voice was the old turtle communicating telepathically. Just how powerful was the turtle that it even had its own voice?</p>
 <p>Peak Martial Saint demonic beasts were unable to achieve that, Qing Shui didn’t ponder any further. The more he thought about it, the more he felt a chill down his back.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think too much, I won’t harm you. You’re a person who keeps his promises.” The old yet solid voice sounded once again.</p>
 <p>“I can’t say that I’ll definitely wake her up but I am willing to try my best.” Qing Shui slowly explained to the old turtle.</p>
 <p>“I know!” The old turtle gradually stepped aside from the palace gate. The old and solid voice echoed in Qing Shui’s mind. Qing Shui could sense a hint of helplessness in its voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t say anything else, nodding toward the old turtle and headed in. The palace gate slowly closed once more. Other than the Portrait of Beauty which Qing Shui took, the surroundings looked the same as before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped for a while before approaching the crystal coffin. When he looked at the woman within the coffin, he was still as stunned as before. Qing Shui felt that she was a woman that was most similar to a goddess.</p>
 <p>Her eyes were closed and her hair in a bun. Her brows soft, her face had no makeup, but yet had a tinge of red on her fair skin. She was unbelievably beautiful and looked as though she was asleep.</p>
 <p>Her snow white clothes could not hide the curves of her body. She had thin shoulders, the curves of her bosom made one’s heart race, her waist looked incredibly slender. Her delicate body was like a jade sculpture made by God, her exposed legs had s sparkling luster.</p>
 <p>Even as she lay in the coffin with her eyes closed, she still exuded a temperament that others dare not profane. She was the most unapproachable woman Qing Shui had ever seen, not because of her coldness but the pride and loftiness that was within her.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui stood in front of the crystal coffin and looked at the sealed beauty, he could feel a dangerous aura exuding out of her body. This caused Qing Shui to helplessly retreat again.</p>
 <p>The old turtle at the gate already possessed unmeasurable strength. This woman was definitely much more stronger than the old turtle. If there were any mishaps, Qing Shui would definitely lose out.</p>
 <p>Recalling the turtle’s aged expression, it had most likely guarded this place for countless years. Since it was fate to have come upon this place, Qing Shui decided to take the risk. Besides, he might not be able to save her.</p>
 <p>After blanking out for a moment, Qing Shui slowly grabbed the woman’s hand. He immediately felt an ice-cold aura being transmitted over, but it was quickly neutralised. Qing Shui controlled his Nature Energy and assimilated it into her meridians.</p>
 <p>Her body was like a unique space, with the Nature Energy that entered seemingly like a drop in the vast ocean. Fortunately, Qing Shui’s Nature Energy didn’t consume any energy, hence he did not need to worry about his body’s endurance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly calmed his mind. He intended to use the purest Nature Energy to break her sealand then suppress and neutralise the poison in her body.</p>
 <p>A day passed. Qing Shui held one of her hands as he continuously injected Nature Energy into the woman’s body. Only after a whole day did he feel a reaction from her body. Or rather, he could feel a slight movement of her body. The seal was beginning to be undone.</p>
 <p>This was within Qing Shui’s expectations. As long as there was sufficient Nature Energy, it could neutralize all forms of evil. Although his Nature Energy was only at the sixth grade now, it did not consume energy which was the most important.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, three days had passed. Qing Shui was amazed to discover that the Nature Energy had already roused her vitality. But simultaneously, it also awakened the poison in her body.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he sensed that the poison within her body was a rare type of cold poison, and there also seemed to be some pink colored component within the poison as well. This caused Qing Shui to panic.</p>
 <p>Pink colored poisons were normally bewildering and stimulating hormones that caused people to lose control over their body. But What Qing Shui feared was that this pink colored poison was a strong stimulant. In other words, it was an aphrodisiac.</p>
 <p>Suddenly!</p>
 <p>The poisonous mist bursted into Qing Shui’s body through his meridians. He wasn’t able to react to this unforeseen event. Right at this moment, he realized that the woman had opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>The cold and bone-chilling pupils were like a world of ice and snow. Their beauty was unparalleled, and they were pure and sacred like a ten thousand years old icicle.</p>
 <p>The contrast in her eyes were really distinct. The pupil was as black as ink, deep and profound whereas the sclera was pure and flawless. It was a pair of emotionless yet extremely attractive eyes.</p>
 <p>In the past, Qing Shui had felt that Duanmu Lingshuang was really cold. But when compared to this woman, she was like a child playing house...</p>
 <p>Looking at this woman, Qing Shui was astonished by her beauty. However, he was unable to resist the cold aura she exuded. Once he noticed the woman had opened her eyes, he wanted to let go of her jade white hand. However, he realised that they were stuck and was unable to loosen his hand.</p>
 <p>That wasn’t the most terrifying matter. What frightened him was when he realized that the aphrodisiac that entered his body had begun to take effect. The Nature Energy was only able to counteract a part of it, but the amount of the tyrannical pink mist was increasing unceasingly.</p>
 <p>He continuously transferred his Nature Energy into the woman’s body. The cold poison in her body had begun to take effect, causing her to be completely immobilized. Qing Shui on the other hand was feeling panicked and nervous.</p>
 <p>Perhaps, he might have to hand over his life today.</p>
 <p>Although the woman was unable to move, her gaze looked toward Qing Shui after a period of blankness. Towards the man who was really close to her, she didn’t have any change in expression.</p>
 <p>When she noticed him holding her hand, she slightly knitted her brows. She seemed like she wanted to move, but she was unable to. At this moment, Qing Shui’s breathing was already in disorder.</p>
 <p>The woman looked at Qing Shui and saw that he was flushed. She then looked toward the hand he was grabbing and felt the energy he was continuously pouring into her. She seemed to understand and remember something which led to a change in her expression.</p>
 <p>Presently, Qing Shui was giving his utmost effort to control his body. The Yin-Yang Image in his consciousness had also started rotating faster. Never could he have thought that he would encounter such a situation. Even though the tyrannical poison wasn’t didn’t cause him to lose his human nature, he was on the edge of losing control of his body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s right hand involuntarily extended. When it was almost touching the beautiful pointed peaks, he fiercely bit his tongue. A trace of fresh blood flowed from his mouth and in exchange for temporary peace. He didn’t want to take advantage of another’s misfortune.</p>
 <p>After the time it took for an incense to burn, Qing Shui once again couldn’t control over himself, so much so that even his mind was starting to waver. His body had already reached a limit. He now thought that he wouldn’t mind dying after he sullied her.</p>
 <p>Gold Needle!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swiftly pierced it into his Lingtai Acupoint.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy was formidable but it still wasn’t strong enough. At the very least, the sixth grade Nature Energy was incapable of resisting the venom that had intruded into his body. The other thing which worried Qing Shui was the icy nature of her body. The chilliness was a lot stronger than Qing Hanye’s. This reminded Qing Shui of the Extreme Yang Body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if he had an Extreme Yang Body, but he felt that even an Extreme Yang Body would have difficulties contending against the chill within her body. He was afraid he would be froze to death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shivered. He was distracted for a moment and by the time he opened his eyes, he realized that one of his hands was already kneading the woman’s perky, plump and perfectly shaped chest.</p>
 <p>The woman cold gaze was fixed on Qing Shui, her brows knitted, but was unable to move.</p>
 <p>The cold he felt on his hand made his heart beat even faster. Despite his utmost effort in retracting his hands, it was in fact as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, I couldn’t control my body.” At this moment, Qing Shui helplessly said to the woman.</p>
 <p>An ice-cold chillness that seemed to have the intent of freezing his soul caused Qing Shui to quiver. When he saw the scene before him, he was stunned. Currently, the woman and himself were already “open to each other” and had already undergone a union.</p>
 <p>The previous coldness that penetrated the soul was a feeling due to his merger with her. The woman’s cold aura was constantly transferred into Qing Shui’s body through their connection and the bone-piercing chilliness kept Qing Shui incomparably clear-headed yet unable to control his own actions.</p>
 <p>The woman’s perfect body was beyond compare. It was like a god’s sculpture except it was too cold. If not for his strong will, he would most likely have died from the cold aura encroaching his body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui revealed a bitter smile. The nameless technique in his body had unknowingly started operating. The bone-piercing cold feeling was really uncomfortable. However, the visual and mental stimulation still made him feel ecstatic to his core.</p>
 <p>The woman’s cool eyes were still as cold and bone-piercing. Her meticulous snow white cheeks had a trace of blush.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui shivered. It was a familiar feeling. He felt the same lively feeling when he placed the Spirited Snake Turtle into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>At this moment, an overbearing force was transmitted from the woman’s body. This caused an abrupt rise in Qing Shui’s strength. But before he could celebrate, the woman below him suddenly smacked him away with her palm. While in mid-air, Qing Shui spat out fresh blood before landing a distance away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui revealed a bitter smile. Previously, he had already felt that the woman’s strength was unfathomable. That feeling was like a human being facing the imminent crushing from a mountain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out some clothes from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and wore them.</p>
 <p>He wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth. At this moment, the woman from the Crystal Coffin had already dressed neatly and was heading towards him. She was truly beautiful like a goddess. But now, she was planning to kill him, not hiding any of the killing intent emitting from her body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t want to die. Hence, he took out the Thunder God and Big Dipper Sword. He’d rather make an attempt to resist rather than just waiting helplessly for death.</p>
 <p>When the woman saw Qing Shui taking out his weapon, she knitted her brows again, locking onto Qing Shui with her aura. Qing Shui appallingly realised from the enormous pressure that he was unexpectedly unable to move when under his opponent’s pressure.</p>
 <p>Just how strong was she?</p>
 <p>With a swing of her hand, Qing Shui had immediately flew upwards. Following that, Qing Shui felt his throat being strangled by a pair of hands which were slowly tightening their grip.</p>
