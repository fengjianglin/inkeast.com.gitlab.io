 <p><strong>Chapter 217 The Crane Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, Speed is Invincible.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 217 – The Crane Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, Speed is Invincible</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui collected over ten drops of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle. Each drop of the golden and viscous blood was the size of a soybean and it all filled up half a small bottle. This was the first time Qing Shui had collected so much blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle at once. He only collected one drop at a time before.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw the “grudging” look from the Golden Medicinal Turtle’s golden and soybean sized eyeballs and felt speechless. What was a turtle like you feeling grudgy about? Ever since he extracted a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle, it seemed to no longer lie on its back to “sunbathe”.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui similarly extracted a small bottle of blood from the 1000-Year Clam. It did not seem to feel a thing. Looking at the quality of the blood, it seemed to be slightly worse off than the Golden Medicinal Turtle’s.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s current biggest pleasure was to see his own improvements everyday. He felt especially calm to see that he was improving everyday and that he was living a substantial life. Everything else to him was transient like the fleeting clouds.</p>
  <p>Sensing that it was about time, Qing Shui cleaned himself up while in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal before he returned to his room to have some sleep. Qing Shui liked to sleep outside the realm, even though he would have four hours less than he would in the realm. He could have slept as much as he would like in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal so that he would not have to sleep outside the realm. After all, he had access to plenty of time in the realm. However, Qing Shui still prefered to sleep outside the realm and moreover, he had plenty of time at hand now.</p>
  <p>He woke up at the same time as usual. Even though Qing Shui said that he wanted to give the recipe of the Tiger Bone Liquor to Canghai and was firmed rejected by the other party, he immediately brewed it on the day itself and gave some more to Canghai. He should be able to drink some today as well.</p>
  <p>Morning practice was for Bear Form. While it had yet to reach the large success stage, it was almost there. After reaching the large success stage, it would be able to bring an even greater addition to his powers.</p>
  <p>Although Qing Shui had yet to reach the large success stage with the Bear Form, he had already started to try out the Crane Form. Before coming to the capital of the Greencloud Continent, Qing Shui had written down a copy of the Crane Form for Yiye Jiange. From there, he managed to comprehend some things by himself. Therefore, Qing Shui had already gone to study the Crane Form briefly since then.</p>
  <p>After a period of practice, Qing Shui became even more certain of the application of the Crane Form. The Crane Form emphasized on balance and allowed the practitioner’s body to turn lighter, and thus increasing one’s speed and strength.</p>
  <p>It was stated that when one attained the same success stage with this, one could reduce 10% of one’s weight. When one attained the large success stage, one could reduce 20% of one’s body weight. Finally, when one attained the great perfection stage, one could reduce half of one’s body weight.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that this weight was not the actual weight of the body, but more of how the weight felt. Qing Shui even reckoned that by reducing the stress by 10% of one’s weight, one should be able to display an additional 10% of the body’s strength.</p>
  <p>“This would be equivalent to increasing another 10% of my powers.” While Qing Shui doubted this idea, he gradually trusted his own guess as he found out that the remaining forms of the Nine Animals Mimicry Techniques were increasingly difficult to pick up. While it was known as the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, Qing Shui was not sure how many types he could master.</p>
  <p>The nine animals were: dragon, phoenix, roc, elephant, crane, bear, tiger, ape, deer. Qing Shui skipped the Ape Form and had only reached the Crane Form now. However, each form was tougher than the prior. Of course, the benefits received would also get better and better. This was also why Qing Shui believed that in the end, he should be able receive a 50% increase in his powers as well as some other abilities.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui continued to practice the Crane Form endlessly in front of the building. The crux of this form laid in the usage of the legs, posture, arms, and most importantly, the set of Crane’s Might.</p>
  <p>It was truly a supporting technique which could be used anytime and could be paired with any other martial technique. Qing Shui realized that when he used the Crane’s Might with the Tiger Tailwhip, it increased the lethality and nimbleness of the Tiger Form and had a natural flow to it.</p>
  <p>It gave one the feeling of lifting something heavy as though it was light; it felt very light but exerted a strong and heavy blow.</p>
  <p>The Crane Form did not come with any stances. It was like the Deer Cantering, a purely supporting technique. It was usual that such techniques would bring about the most benefits. While the Deer Cantering was lined up last, Qing Shui felt that it should have been ranked alongside the Crane Form since it was such a powerful technique which could increase one’s speed by 20% for the small success stage.</p>
  <p>It might be because the difficulty of the Deer Cantering was not comparable to the other form in front of it. Perhaps, maybe it was because the Crane Form solely increased one’s speed. Qing Shui guessed that there was another possibility.</p>
  <p>Amongst those with powers, the gap between their speeds was actually very small. For example, a Xiantian cultivator’s strength was 80,000 jin. One at the pinnacle of Houtian (at the pinnacle of the Martial General realm) had a strength of 10,000 jin. However, in terms of speed, while a Xiantian cultivator’s speed could allow him to cross twenty meters in an instant, one at the pinnacle of Houtian could also reach over ten meters.</p>
  <p>In terms of the strength, their gap could be eight times greater or even higher. However, in terms of speed, the difference was only about twice as fast. While it was only two times faster, it could already be considered a difference between the heavens and the earth.</p>
  <p>Speed was strength. When one’s weapon had already slashed towards your head while your head was only in midway, with sufficient speed, there was nothing which could not be overcome. This was the reason that amongst all the martial arts in the world, speed was the only one which could not be overthrown. This was also why the 3rd grade black gemstone was the most precious amongst all other gemstones of the same grade.</p>
  <p>What left Qing Shui with the deepest impression was the terrifying speed Canghai had when he took action. Before Canghai, those Elders from the Immortal Sword Sect were so pitiful that they were not even given a chance to retaliate.</p>
  <p>This was the great gap between two Martial Kings who were only one grade apart. The aura from the one who was one grade higher could overwhelm the other. In front of absolute power and speed, techniques and skills were nothing.</p>
  <p>A light smile hung at the corners of Qing Shui’s lips. When he applied the Crane’s Might using his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he had a fluttering feeling as if he was about to fly. However, Qing Shui knew that even if he were to reach the great perfection stage, he would not be able to fly. He also knew that it would not lose out when compared to the Deer Cantering’s speed. Most importantly, it brought about the balance of one’s posture and the explosive increase of one’s strength.</p>
  <p>While there weren’t attacking stances in the Crane Form, there was a set of steps. However, Qing Shui had no time to practice it. He felt that the Bear Form was already hard enough, but now in comparison, he suddenly felt that the Bear Form was an easy feat that was especially easy to pick up.</p>
  <p>The Crane Form depended on his daring attempts and its progress was especially fast. It was such that Qing Shui could already incorporate the awkward movements into other techniques without having to familiarise himself with the Crane Form.</p>
  <p>The most important thing was the feeling. What Qing Shui felt was the most unbelievable was that when the Crane Form was incorporated with the Bear Form, they did not clash but rather complemented each other.</p>
  <p>The Bear Form emphasized on strength and increased one’s weight. When the Bear Form was applied, Qing Shui felt that his body was heavier than 1000 jin. Each attack was strong but firm, and even his body would be as stable as a mountain which increased one’s resistance to attack more.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had attempted to incorporate the Bear Form with the Crane Form out of an experimental mindset, but Qing Shui fell into a daze. It felt as if a bear was about take flight…</p>
  <p>A bear that could fly? Qing Shui knew that they could not. However, he noticed that the heavy feeling from the Bear Form was reduced, but the prowess from the the Bear Form was not.</p>
  <p>With just one move, Qing Shui was like a speeding bear that could bring about a horrifying collision force. From a distance away, the Canghai couple was staring in shock at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Ruo Tong, what do you think about this fellow?” Canghai turned his head towards his beautiful wife beside him and asked, smiling.</p>
  <p>“For the past decades, he is the 2nd young man I cannot see through. Others would be full of expectations for him and even I can’t help but take a liking to him.” The beautiful woman smiled at Canghai and said.</p>
  <p>“I’m jealous. You’re not even concerned about saying that you’ve taken a liking to him in front of me.” Canghai smiled as he held the woman’s hand.</p>
  <p>The woman blushed, exuding a charm which would tingle one’s bones amidst her mature aura. She rolled her eyes at Canghai and said, “What are you talking about? You’re being nonsensical despite being 70-80 years old.”</p>
  <p>“Hehe, but it’s a pity that Yueyue seemed to have no interest in him. If not, he would surely be the most suitable man for Yueyue.” Canghai said, feeling that it was such a pity.</p>
  <p>“Although Yueyue does not feel for him now, it doesn’t mean that she won’t feel for him in the future.” The woman said charmingly.</p>
  <p>Canghai was stunned. He felt very satisfied as he looked as his beautiful wife in terms of both beauty and virtue. Ever since they had Yueyue, he had felt even more heartwarming and satisfied. Recalling the happiness the three of them had when Yueyue was young, he fell into a daze.</p>
  <p>Their daughter had grown up gradually, and inherited their excellent genes to become even more outstanding than the two of them. Her cultivation had also improved at a very fast rate, but it was just that she had not met the person she liked even though she was close to 30 years old.</p>
  <p>While 30 years old was considered young in this world, Canghai was worried that his daughter had extremely high expectations and would not care for ordinary guys. He suddenly recalled the words that fellow had said. He had not met someone who would be a good match for his daughter.</p>
  <p>“You’re saying that Yueyue will like this chap?!” Canghai took another look at Qing Shui’s clumsy yet nimble movements that had a good sense of coordination. Amongst the youngsters, only that guy would be comparable to himself. Amongst those who were close to Yueyue’s age, from both males and females, there were, of course, a few characters who were peerless and well-known in their generation. This chap would definitely be the most mysterious one of them all.</p>
  <p>“I didn’t say that. I only said that there’s such a possibility. He might already have entered our daughter’s heart.” The mature and beautiful woman looked at Canghai slyly and said.</p>
  <p>“Alright, don’t be keeping me in suspense. I’ll let you have your way with me tonight, alright? Quickly tell me.” Canghai pulled the woman into his arms and said seductively into her ears.</p>
  <p>“You old pervert, are you courting death?!” The woman laid in Canghai’s arms, speaking with such an intoxicating voice that only Canghai could enjoy.</p>
  <p>The two of them stayed in each other’s arms quietly for a while before the woman raised her pink face and took a step away from Canghai. She did not forget to throw him a charming glare while she was at it.</p>
  <p>“Idiot, you’ll forever be an idiot. Can’t you see it for yourself? When have you seen your daughter so close with a young man? The other time those few guys from the Immortal Sword Sect came and wanted this chap’s life, did you see her expression?” A charming smile hung on the woman’s beautiful face as she said to Canghai.</p>
  <p>Canghai was stunned as he stood there in a daze. He recalled the anxiety and worry reflected on his daughter’s face that day. It was the first time in so many years that Canghai had seen such a look on his daughter’s face towards someone outside the family. Speaking from someone with experience, he could tell that there were other factors behind that expression, but it was likely that even she herself was not sure what they were.</p>
  <p>This was also considered the case where those who were closely involved were not able to see the actual situation as clearly. It signalled the start or change of a relationship between a male and a female.</p>
  <p>“This chap’s Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine is really good stuff.” Canghai suddenly said, although he was still carrying a smiling expression. He looked at Qing Shui who was a distance away.</p>
  <p>When the woman heard Canghai’s words, the blush on her face did not fade. Rather, it turned even more deeper as she recalled the crazy time they had the night before which had caused them to almost not sleep a wink.</p>
  <p>During breakfast, the five of them sat down together, appearing even more like a family to others. Each of them exuded a brilliant disposition and had with them undisputable good looks.</p>
  <p>“Senior, I might still need to continue to stay here and be a bother for a while. There may even be times when I bring trouble for Senior. While I have not as many abilities, there’s this one pill which I can refine. Please accept it as a token of my appreciation.” Qing Shui took out two small porcelain bottles, each with two Small Revitalizing Pellets.</p>
  <p>He placed the two bottles before Canghai couple. Huoyun Liu-Li knew what they were, but she did not say anything even though her lips twitched.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue fell into a short moment of confusion. While she did not know what it was, she felt that Qing Shui seemed to be neglecting her. This was the first time she had ever felt this way. In the past, she never cared for what others did or thought.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue appeared a bit dejected, even though it was just a little. She did not know why she had felt this way herself. It might be how a person would feel when a man saw some unknown guy marrying a beauty he did not know.</p>
  <p>“Oh, it’s a gift for us? You know alchemy?” Canghai asked in astonishment as he reached out his hand to pick up the small porcelain bottle. This time around, he was really astonished. Ever since he knew that Qing Shui was able to brew the Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine, he knew that this young man was really an exceptional guy in all areas.</p>
  <p>“1st-level King Grade Medicinal Pellets!” Canghai looked at Qing Shui in astonishment with wide open eyes.</p>
  <p>When Canghai Mingyue’s mother heard this, she also quickly opened the porcelain bottle. She took a glance and said to Canghai, “The lustre and smell is really one which only a King Grade Medicine would have. What are its effects?”</p>
  <p>Her last question was targeted towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“To increase one’s abilities in all areas by 10%.”</p>
  <p>“Cough, this thing is too precious. We can’t accept this!” When Canghai heard Qing Shui talking about the effects of the pill, there was an obvious gleam in his eyes. It was one of yearning towards power.</p>
  <p>“Why would that be? While the effects are barely acceptable, it’s a pity that each person can only take two of it.” QIng Shui smiled and said to Canghai.</p>
  <p>“That’s how it should be as well. If not, wouldn’t one be peerless if he were to continuously take this? This is perverse as it is, and can be considered the best amongst the 1st-level King Grade medicine.” Canghai gave Qing Shui a weird look but continued to smile and said.</p>
  <p>“The best amongst the 1st-level King Grade medicine? Are 1st-level King Grade medicine further split into many different levels?” Qing Shui noticed that there were things he did not know from Canghai’s words.</p>
  <p>Canghai was stunned. He had not expected that one who could create a 1st-level King Grade medicine would not know such general knowledge in alchemy.</p>
  <p>“As long as it can increase 10% of one type of ability, it can be considered a 1st-level King Grade medicine. Even if it can increase 10% of various abilities, it still can only be considered a 1st-level King Grade medicine, just like how it is for this pill of yours.” Canghai smiled and looked at Qing Shui, as if he wanted to see something from Qing Shui’s expression. However, he was eventually disappointed.</p>
  <p>“Oh, so that’s the case. Haha, I don’t know about all these but can only create this one medicine. I hope that Senior will not look down on it.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and grinned.</p>
  <p>Canghai was speechless. This medicine would be priceless no matter where it appeared, especially amongst those who have reached the realm of Martial King or higher. The higher one’s level of cultivation was, the better the effects it would bring. Moreover, this could bring about a 10% increase in one’s various abilities. It was even more precious that those 3rd level King Grade medicine which could only increase one’s abilities in one area.</p>
  <p>Canghai took off a bangle from his hand which had a black gemstone the same as what Mistress Canghai had given Huoyun Liu-Li, and passed it to Qing Shui. “You’ll probably not take a fancy to anything else, so you can have this!”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue saw that her father’s bangle had also a 3rd grade black gemstone. She reached her hand towards the black gemstone near her chest. She knew that it was a 4th grade black gemstone…</p>

 <p><strong>AST 217 – The Crane Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, Speed is Invincible</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui collected over ten drops of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle. Each drop of the golden and viscous blood was the size of a soybean and it all filled up half a small bottle. This was the first time Qing Shui had collected so much blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle at once. He only collected one drop at a time before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the “grudging” look from the Golden Medicinal Turtle’s golden and soybean sized eyeballs and felt speechless. What was a turtle like you feeling grudgy about? Ever since he extracted a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle, it seemed to no longer lie on its back to “sunbathe”.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui similarly extracted a small bottle of blood from the 1000-Year Clam. It did not seem to feel a thing. Looking at the quality of the blood, it seemed to be slightly worse off than the Golden Medicinal Turtle’s.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s current biggest pleasure was to see his own improvements everyday. He felt especially calm to see that he was improving everyday and that he was living a substantial life. Everything else to him was transient like the fleeting clouds.</p>
 <p>Sensing that it was about time, Qing Shui cleaned himself up while in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal before he returned to his room to have some sleep. Qing Shui liked to sleep outside the realm, even though he would have four hours less than he would in the realm. He could have slept as much as he would like in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal so that he would not have to sleep outside the realm. After all, he had access to plenty of time in the realm. However, Qing Shui still prefered to sleep outside the realm and moreover, he had plenty of time at hand now.</p>
 <p>He woke up at the same time as usual. Even though Qing Shui said that he wanted to give the recipe of the Tiger Bone Liquor to Canghai and was firmed rejected by the other party, he immediately brewed it on the day itself and gave some more to Canghai. He should be able to drink some today as well.</p>
 <p>Morning practice was for Bear Form. While it had yet to reach the large success stage, it was almost there. After reaching the large success stage, it would be able to bring an even greater addition to his powers.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had yet to reach the large success stage with the Bear Form, he had already started to try out the Crane Form. Before coming to the capital of the Greencloud Continent, Qing Shui had written down a copy of the Crane Form for Yiye Jiange. From there, he managed to comprehend some things by himself. Therefore, Qing Shui had already gone to study the Crane Form briefly since then.</p>
 <p>After a period of practice, Qing Shui became even more certain of the application of the Crane Form. The Crane Form emphasized on balance and allowed the practitioner’s body to turn lighter, and thus increasing one’s speed and strength.</p>
 <p>It was stated that when one attained the same success stage with this, one could reduce 10% of one’s weight. When one attained the large success stage, one could reduce 20% of one’s body weight. Finally, when one attained the great perfection stage, one could reduce half of one’s body weight.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this weight was not the actual weight of the body, but more of how the weight felt. Qing Shui even reckoned that by reducing the stress by 10% of one’s weight, one should be able to display an additional 10% of the body’s strength.</p>
 <p>“This would be equivalent to increasing another 10% of my powers.” While Qing Shui doubted this idea, he gradually trusted his own guess as he found out that the remaining forms of the Nine Animals Mimicry Techniques were increasingly difficult to pick up. While it was known as the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, Qing Shui was not sure how many types he could master.</p>
 <p>The nine animals were: dragon, phoenix, roc, elephant, crane, bear, tiger, ape, deer. Qing Shui skipped the Ape Form and had only reached the Crane Form now. However, each form was tougher than the prior. Of course, the benefits received would also get better and better. This was also why Qing Shui believed that in the end, he should be able receive a 50% increase in his powers as well as some other abilities.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to practice the Crane Form endlessly in front of the building. The crux of this form laid in the usage of the legs, posture, arms, and most importantly, the set of Crane’s Might.</p>
 <p>It was truly a supporting technique which could be used anytime and could be paired with any other martial technique. Qing Shui realized that when he used the Crane’s Might with the Tiger Tailwhip, it increased the lethality and nimbleness of the Tiger Form and had a natural flow to it.</p>
 <p>It gave one the feeling of lifting something heavy as though it was light; it felt very light but exerted a strong and heavy blow.</p>
 <p>The Crane Form did not come with any stances. It was like the Deer Cantering, a purely supporting technique. It was usual that such techniques would bring about the most benefits. While the Deer Cantering was lined up last, Qing Shui felt that it should have been ranked alongside the Crane Form since it was such a powerful technique which could increase one’s speed by 20% for the small success stage.</p>
 <p>It might be because the difficulty of the Deer Cantering was not comparable to the other form in front of it. Perhaps, maybe it was because the Crane Form solely increased one’s speed. Qing Shui guessed that there was another possibility.</p>
 <p>Amongst those with powers, the gap between their speeds was actually very small. For example, a Xiantian cultivator’s strength was 80,000 jin. One at the pinnacle of Houtian (at the pinnacle of the Martial General realm) had a strength of 10,000 jin. However, in terms of speed, while a Xiantian cultivator’s speed could allow him to cross twenty meters in an instant, one at the pinnacle of Houtian could also reach over ten meters.</p>
 <p>In terms of the strength, their gap could be eight times greater or even higher. However, in terms of speed, the difference was only about twice as fast. While it was only two times faster, it could already be considered a difference between the heavens and the earth.</p>
 <p>Speed was strength. When one’s weapon had already slashed towards your head while your head was only in midway, with sufficient speed, there was nothing which could not be overcome. This was the reason that amongst all the martial arts in the world, speed was the only one which could not be overthrown. This was also why the 3rd grade black gemstone was the most precious amongst all other gemstones of the same grade.</p>
 <p>What left Qing Shui with the deepest impression was the terrifying speed Canghai had when he took action. Before Canghai, those Elders from the Immortal Sword Sect were so pitiful that they were not even given a chance to retaliate.</p>
 <p>This was the great gap between two Martial Kings who were only one grade apart. The aura from the one who was one grade higher could overwhelm the other. In front of absolute power and speed, techniques and skills were nothing.</p>
 <p>A light smile hung at the corners of Qing Shui’s lips. When he applied the Crane’s Might using his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he had a fluttering feeling as if he was about to fly. However, Qing Shui knew that even if he were to reach the great perfection stage, he would not be able to fly. He also knew that it would not lose out when compared to the Deer Cantering’s speed. Most importantly, it brought about the balance of one’s posture and the explosive increase of one’s strength.</p>
 <p>While there weren’t attacking stances in the Crane Form, there was a set of steps. However, Qing Shui had no time to practice it. He felt that the Bear Form was already hard enough, but now in comparison, he suddenly felt that the Bear Form was an easy feat that was especially easy to pick up.</p>
 <p>The Crane Form depended on his daring attempts and its progress was especially fast. It was such that Qing Shui could already incorporate the awkward movements into other techniques without having to familiarise himself with the Crane Form.</p>
 <p>The most important thing was the feeling. What Qing Shui felt was the most unbelievable was that when the Crane Form was incorporated with the Bear Form, they did not clash but rather complemented each other.</p>
 <p>The Bear Form emphasized on strength and increased one’s weight. When the Bear Form was applied, Qing Shui felt that his body was heavier than 1000 jin. Each attack was strong but firm, and even his body would be as stable as a mountain which increased one’s resistance to attack more.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had attempted to incorporate the Bear Form with the Crane Form out of an experimental mindset, but Qing Shui fell into a daze. It felt as if a bear was about take flight…</p>
 <p>A bear that could fly? Qing Shui knew that they could not. However, he noticed that the heavy feeling from the Bear Form was reduced, but the prowess from the the Bear Form was not.</p>
 <p>With just one move, Qing Shui was like a speeding bear that could bring about a horrifying collision force. From a distance away, the Canghai couple was staring in shock at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Ruo Tong, what do you think about this fellow?” Canghai turned his head towards his beautiful wife beside him and asked, smiling.</p>
 <p>“For the past decades, he is the 2nd young man I cannot see through. Others would be full of expectations for him and even I can’t help but take a liking to him.” The beautiful woman smiled at Canghai and said.</p>
 <p>“I’m jealous. You’re not even concerned about saying that you’ve taken a liking to him in front of me.” Canghai smiled as he held the woman’s hand.</p>
 <p>The woman blushed, exuding a charm which would tingle one’s bones amidst her mature aura. She rolled her eyes at Canghai and said, “What are you talking about? You’re being nonsensical despite being 70-80 years old.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, but it’s a pity that Yueyue seemed to have no interest in him. If not, he would surely be the most suitable man for Yueyue.” Canghai said, feeling that it was such a pity.</p>
 <p>“Although Yueyue does not feel for him now, it doesn’t mean that she won’t feel for him in the future.” The woman said charmingly.</p>
 <p>Canghai was stunned. He felt very satisfied as he looked as his beautiful wife in terms of both beauty and virtue. Ever since they had Yueyue, he had felt even more heartwarming and satisfied. Recalling the happiness the three of them had when Yueyue was young, he fell into a daze.</p>
 <p>Their daughter had grown up gradually, and inherited their excellent genes to become even more outstanding than the two of them. Her cultivation had also improved at a very fast rate, but it was just that she had not met the person she liked even though she was close to 30 years old.</p>
 <p>While 30 years old was considered young in this world, Canghai was worried that his daughter had extremely high expectations and would not care for ordinary guys. He suddenly recalled the words that fellow had said. He had not met someone who would be a good match for his daughter.</p>
 <p>“You’re saying that Yueyue will like this chap?!” Canghai took another look at Qing Shui’s clumsy yet nimble movements that had a good sense of coordination. Amongst the youngsters, only that guy would be comparable to himself. Amongst those who were close to Yueyue’s age, from both males and females, there were, of course, a few characters who were peerless and well-known in their generation. This chap would definitely be the most mysterious one of them all.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t say that. I only said that there’s such a possibility. He might already have entered our daughter’s heart.” The mature and beautiful woman looked at Canghai slyly and said.</p>
 <p>“Alright, don’t be keeping me in suspense. I’ll let you have your way with me tonight, alright? Quickly tell me.” Canghai pulled the woman into his arms and said seductively into her ears.</p>
 <p>“You old pervert, are you courting death?!” The woman laid in Canghai’s arms, speaking with such an intoxicating voice that only Canghai could enjoy.</p>
 <p>The two of them stayed in each other’s arms quietly for a while before the woman raised her pink face and took a step away from Canghai. She did not forget to throw him a charming glare while she was at it.</p>
 <p>“Idiot, you’ll forever be an idiot. Can’t you see it for yourself? When have you seen your daughter so close with a young man? The other time those few guys from the Immortal Sword Sect came and wanted this chap’s life, did you see her expression?” A charming smile hung on the woman’s beautiful face as she said to Canghai.</p>
 <p>Canghai was stunned as he stood there in a daze. He recalled the anxiety and worry reflected on his daughter’s face that day. It was the first time in so many years that Canghai had seen such a look on his daughter’s face towards someone outside the family. Speaking from someone with experience, he could tell that there were other factors behind that expression, but it was likely that even she herself was not sure what they were.</p>
 <p>This was also considered the case where those who were closely involved were not able to see the actual situation as clearly. It signalled the start or change of a relationship between a male and a female.</p>
 <p>“This chap’s Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine is really good stuff.” Canghai suddenly said, although he was still carrying a smiling expression. He looked at Qing Shui who was a distance away.</p>
 <p>When the woman heard Canghai’s words, the blush on her face did not fade. Rather, it turned even more deeper as she recalled the crazy time they had the night before which had caused them to almost not sleep a wink.</p>
 <p>During breakfast, the five of them sat down together, appearing even more like a family to others. Each of them exuded a brilliant disposition and had with them undisputable good looks.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I might still need to continue to stay here and be a bother for a while. There may even be times when I bring trouble for Senior. While I have not as many abilities, there’s this one pill which I can refine. Please accept it as a token of my appreciation.” Qing Shui took out two small porcelain bottles, each with two Small Revitalizing Pellets.</p>
 <p>He placed the two bottles before Canghai couple. Huoyun Liu-Li knew what they were, but she did not say anything even though her lips twitched.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue fell into a short moment of confusion. While she did not know what it was, she felt that Qing Shui seemed to be neglecting her. This was the first time she had ever felt this way. In the past, she never cared for what others did or thought.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue appeared a bit dejected, even though it was just a little. She did not know why she had felt this way herself. It might be how a person would feel when a man saw some unknown guy marrying a beauty he did not know.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s a gift for us? You know alchemy?” Canghai asked in astonishment as he reached out his hand to pick up the small porcelain bottle. This time around, he was really astonished. Ever since he knew that Qing Shui was able to brew the Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine, he knew that this young man was really an exceptional guy in all areas.</p>
 <p>“1st-level King Grade Medicinal Pellets!” Canghai looked at Qing Shui in astonishment with wide open eyes.</p>
 <p>When Canghai Mingyue’s mother heard this, she also quickly opened the porcelain bottle. She took a glance and said to Canghai, “The lustre and smell is really one which only a King Grade Medicine would have. What are its effects?”</p>
 <p>Her last question was targeted towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“To increase one’s abilities in all areas by 10%.”</p>
 <p>“Cough, this thing is too precious. We can’t accept this!” When Canghai heard Qing Shui talking about the effects of the pill, there was an obvious gleam in his eyes. It was one of yearning towards power.</p>
 <p>“Why would that be? While the effects are barely acceptable, it’s a pity that each person can only take two of it.” QIng Shui smiled and said to Canghai.</p>
 <p>“That’s how it should be as well. If not, wouldn’t one be peerless if he were to continuously take this? This is perverse as it is, and can be considered the best amongst the 1st-level King Grade medicine.” Canghai gave Qing Shui a weird look but continued to smile and said.</p>
 <p>“The best amongst the 1st-level King Grade medicine? Are 1st-level King Grade medicine further split into many different levels?” Qing Shui noticed that there were things he did not know from Canghai’s words.</p>
 <p>Canghai was stunned. He had not expected that one who could create a 1st-level King Grade medicine would not know such general knowledge in alchemy.</p>
 <p>“As long as it can increase 10% of one type of ability, it can be considered a 1st-level King Grade medicine. Even if it can increase 10% of various abilities, it still can only be considered a 1st-level King Grade medicine, just like how it is for this pill of yours.” Canghai smiled and looked at Qing Shui, as if he wanted to see something from Qing Shui’s expression. However, he was eventually disappointed.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so that’s the case. Haha, I don’t know about all these but can only create this one medicine. I hope that Senior will not look down on it.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and grinned.</p>
 <p>Canghai was speechless. This medicine would be priceless no matter where it appeared, especially amongst those who have reached the realm of Martial King or higher. The higher one’s level of cultivation was, the better the effects it would bring. Moreover, this could bring about a 10% increase in one’s various abilities. It was even more precious that those 3rd level King Grade medicine which could only increase one’s abilities in one area.</p>
 <p>Canghai took off a bangle from his hand which had a black gemstone the same as what Mistress Canghai had given Huoyun Liu-Li, and passed it to Qing Shui. “You’ll probably not take a fancy to anything else, so you can have this!”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue saw that her father’s bangle had also a 3rd grade black gemstone. She reached her hand towards the black gemstone near her chest. She knew that it was a 4th grade black gemstone…</p>
