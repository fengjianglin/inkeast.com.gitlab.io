 <p><strong>AST 1234 - Ten Million Nimbus Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the revived Golden Ni Lion&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>The current power of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant has now achieved a terrifying level. An all-out attack from it has already achieved around 10 million nimbus. Let alone it was still able to weaken the opponent’s strength as much as 10%. For someone who achieved this kind of strength, even merely ten percent was also a really terrifying amount. The prowess of the current Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp was also very formidable.</p>
 <p>Once the opponents got staggered from the shake, the terrifying attacking prowess of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant would immediately obliterate its opponent. Once dizzy, one’s defensive ability would be reduced significantly.</p>
 <p>Even though it didn’t learn any powerful killer moves through its breakthrough this time, the change in the Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp had already made its strength increased significantly. This was an area staggering attack.</p>
 <p>That so-called Saint Child from Saint Child Band, if he was to come now, Qing Shui would at least be able to fight to a draw with him with the coordination of both himself and the dragon elephant. If that Saint Child merely had power worth 10 million nimbus, Qing Shui felt that it wouldn’t even be fun fighting him.</p>
 <p>Looking at the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, a powerful battle intention emerged in Qing Shui. He might not be a proper beast tamer, but in others eyes, he was already the most powerful beast tamer in the world.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, he had already used five Ancient Demonic Fruits. There were only five remaining. This was a present given by the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal after it upgraded. By using it along with Spring of Life, he was able to let his demonic beasts go through a never-before-seen kind of breakthrough.</p>
 <p>The most important thing was still the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, now that its innate physical strength has broken through to thirty thousand nimbus, Qing Shui didn’t know how much he could absorb this time.</p>
 <p>Other than that, the Heaven Shaking Drums had no effect on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. But Qing Shui was really happy that the Spirit Gathering Lamp could continue to be used. The attack prowess of both the Fire Bird and Thunderous Beast had doubled. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider, on the other hand, Qing Shui wasn’t sure if it received help from the Spirit Gathering Lamp or the Heaven Shaking Drum, in any case, its strength also doubled.</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable too, Qing Shui has now come to understand, if it exceeded two million nimbus of strength, the Heaven Shaking Drum would lose its effect to amplify the attacks. In other words, for the Heaven Shaking Drum at its current realm, it could only help amplify strength below that of two million nimbus.</p>
 <p>As for the Spirit Gathering Lamp, Qing Shui wasn’t sure about it. Nevertheless, he had a feeling that it should be similar. After all, it was in the same grade as the Heaven Shaking Drum. Qing Shui was a bit disappointed. If the Heaven Shaking Drum could amplify its strength, would the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had the strength which could dominate an entire Grade Four Dynasty?</p>
 <p>After thinking for a while, Qing Shui found it unnecessary for him to think about it. It would be better if he went on to cultivate his magic weapons. In the past, he has never felt anything about it. Back then he was quite weak, even if the demonic beasts were to experience boost as much as one fold in strength, it wouldn’t really be of use. But now, things were different. An increase of one-fold in attack prowess was indeed really heaven-defying. He wished that by the time he achieved a high cultivation realm, things like him being able to experience an increased one fold in attack prowess would happen. If it didn’t, he would definitely feel really depressed about it. For example, if he had strength worth around merely a hundred thousand or a million nimbus, Qing Shui would most likely be so depressed that he'd spurt out blood. After all, both the Five-Headed Demonic Spider and the Thunderous Beast could now gain an increase of almost a million nimbus of strength.</p>
 <p>This was only Qing Shui’s imagination. It’s unlikely that it would happen. Even if it didn’t increase, things like it continuing to maintain the one fold in attack prowess should still exist.</p>
 <p>Moving on, it was the Coiled Dragon Statue. Other than the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the other demonic beasts all got their defenses increased by one fold. And also, the Spirit Channeling Jade has also gone up by one grade. In the future, it would be even harder for it to break through.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now very hardly used the Soulshake Bell. Similarly, there were very rare high level tamers as well as alchemists with advanced abilities. Hence, Qing Shui hasn’t been able to use it all along. However, there were still a lot of people with one or two powerful demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Other than that, Qing Shui could also use the high grade Sacred Beast Pill. Unfortunately, for now, he only had those low grade ones. But he also wasn’t really planning to tame other beasts unless he came upon one which he found unusually suitable for himself.</p>
 <p>As for the Dragon Phoenix and other things, Qing Shui chose to temporarily put them aside for now. It’s not that he didn’t want to think about them, it’s just that he knew it was impossible. People who managed to tame Dragons and Phoenix were all people from ancient inherited tribes. They had a terrifying strength and noble bloodline. In ordinary people’s eyes, they were existences equivalent to that of gods.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a peek at his Dantian only to find yet another grey pearl. It looked simple and unadorned yet magnanimous. Compared to the one last time, it seemed to be even bigger. This was the feedback of strength received from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Upon making it in time for the ascension of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, things like this had actually happened twice. The rate at which the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant helped Qing Shui improved his strength has gotten faster by multiple folds. If other people were to find out how much cultivation he could increase at once, a lot of people would definitely feel upset to the point they start knocking their head against the wall.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui knew that he would at least still need a bit more time if he wanted to refine this energy. The last time the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant merged with the Fire Dragon, he was already given a bit of time to spare. Counting on, he has already spent a quite a long time within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It should have been ten years and more.</p>
 <p>However, one day of the outside world was only equivalent to three months and a bit more spent within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Hence, Qing Shui made up his mind to wait a bit longer. For safety reason, it would be better if he waited. He would never allow any mistakes at a time like this.</p>
 <p>Because Qing Shui had his current strength as his foundation, he felt that it was relatively less dangerous absorbing the strength now compared to last time. At least situations like his body exploding would no longer appear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui passed his remaining time in cultivating. In between, he would refine demons, draw talismans and some other things. Now, the seal of the talismans were all already drawn directly on top of the armors and whips. They carried the same effect as the Heavenly Talismans.</p>
 <p>As for his realms in drawing, Qing Shui was unable to break through his current level. Once he broke through, he felt that the power of the Heavenly Talisman would be increased significantly. By then, he would be able to draw even higher grade of Heavenly Talismans.</p>
 <p>This was because now, the growth rate provided by the Heavenly Talisman was just like the Heaven Shaking Drum. It only had very little effect, or rather, it could even be said that it was no longer effective. This might have had a huge thing to do with the grades of the talismans or Qing Shui’s realm.</p>
 <p>Back then, the ancestors from Lin Clan may have been really powerful with their Heavenly Talismans. But later on, it’s very likely that their clan might have declined. After arriving at Western Oxhe Continent, the use of the Heavenly Talismans was also basically considered to have been obsolete.</p>
 <p>It was a normal thing that martial arts got disqualified. Once someone was strong, they would have opportunities to cultivate even stronger martial arts. Hence, a lot of people would ignore their martial arts from the past. It’s just the same in the sense of weapons. It’s not that surprising.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had time. Hence, he didn’t really want all of his martial techniques from the past to be disqualified. For example, the Blue Lotus Art. At that time, it was a crippled martial art. However, later on, unusual changes took place.</p>
 <p>However, lately, whenever Qing Shui was free, he would start cultivating the modified Blue Lotus Art and get the people from Qing Clan cultivate it after.</p>
 <p>It was quite rare to see someone modifying a certain martial technique across the continent. On top of that, there were even fewer people who managed to modify it well without any flaws. Not only would they need to possess tremendous strength, they would also need to be very careful and cautious. Additionally, they would also need to have achieved a terrifying state in their study of martial arts to be able to modify it. Also, they would need to understand clearly about the meridians across human’s body.</p>
 <p>The reason is that there were quite a lot of people who died as a result of modifying their martial techniques. Hence, very few people across the continent would actually do so. In comparison, even fewer people would invent new martial techniques.</p>
 <p>The way Qing Shui modified the Blue Lotus Art was through altering the art slightly following the route of his cultivation after it underwent an unusual change. He made it more suitable for it to cultivate for someone who reached a certain strength. He was aware that all along, his grandpa has always been looking forward to seeing someone cultivating the Blue Lotus Art up to the extent of achieving the 9th Lotus Manifestation Stage.</p>
 <p>Who was the ancestor of Qing Clan? Qing Clan was a clan which his grandfather started up after he moved to Qing Village alone. In the past, where did his grandfather come from? Were there more Qing Clans in other places?</p>
 <p>There were very few people with surname Qing.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui has been to quite a lot of places, he only managed to took a quick glance over most of them as he passed through. Some of them, he even skipped right through them. The continent was certainly too big. It was definitely a story in fantasy for someone to step all across it with both their feet. The extent to how wide the area around the continents was was unimaginable. He remembered the world he lived in his previous incarnation. All of them added up together wasn’t even the size of a country here. Just from this, one could already imagine how boundless this world was.</p>
 <p>His grandpa has never once mentioned Qing Clan and the house which he used to live in. Qing Shui didn’t really know why. He also didn’t know what kind of people still remained within Qing Clan at the moment. Were there still other descendants of Qing Clan other than his grandfather?</p>
 <p>He once again remembered the man who called him father. Qing Shui felt that he should make haste and go explore it. Waiting until he finished refining the strength this time, he should most likely be able to explore around Western Oxhe Continent. Perhaps, maybe even the other remaining continents and finish off all of his things.</p>
 <p>Of course, it also included Di Chen. It’s time he should go to Lotus Sect. Qing Shui wondered what kind of circumstances it would be by the time he met Di Chen.</p>
 <p>He continued cultivating until he went out. The sky was already bright. By the time he arrived at the backyard, he saw Qing Sha cultivating. She was still working really hard doing things which Qing Shui taught her. Furthermore, Qing Shui has also left behind quite a lot of Spirit Concentrating Pill to aid her in her cultivations. Now, Qing Shui’s Spirit Concentrating Pill could help increase the rate of cultivation by five times. Meaning, cultivating for one day would be equivalent to doing so for five days.</p>
 <p>There were more and more medicinal herbs within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Similarly, their age was also becoming older and older causing their medicinal effects to be more and more significant.</p>
 <p>After two hours, Qing Shui only approached Qing Sha when he saw her stopped practicing her fists.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, I am going to give you a demonic beast. Do you want it?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while. Logically speaking, no matter what gender a warrior was, he or she would still like demonic beasts. Indeed, they were permanent helpers and occasionally mounts.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Sha was no ordinary person. It would be hard to tell whether she liked it or not.</p>
 <p>“I want it, but I don’t know how to tame it.” Qing Sha looked at Qing Shui enthusiastically.</p>
 <p>“Since I am going to give it to you, I will naturally have my way to do it.” Qing Shui smiled as he took out both the Spring of Life and Ancient Demonic Fruit. He also took out a low grade Sacred Beast Pill. With Qing Sha’s current strength, using the low grade Sacred Beast Pill to tame the Golden Ni Lion shouldn’t pose any problems.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui managed to pull off all of these fairly quickly. The Golden Ni Lion was still not considered to be that powerful. With Qing Sha’s current strength, she could pull off tricks like controlling her aura fairly easily. He first fed it with the Spring of Life, then, he proceeded to give it the low grade Sacred Beast Pill before giving it the final Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>The Spring of Life could restore its life. The Ancient Demonic Fruit, on the other hand, could help once again produce the bones and organs throughout the Golden Ni Lion’s body to be once at the moment when its strength was increasing tremendously. It could also help strengthen both its bones and organs.</p>
 <p>During this process, Qing Shui realized Qing Sha was looking enthusiastically at the Golden Ni Lion all along. Her love for the Golden Ni Lion was completely shown through her eyes. When Qing Shui sealed the Golden Ni Lion originally, he was already planning to either tame it himself once he managed to bring it back to life or let other people tamed it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui already felt satisfied seeing Qing Sha happy. This Golden Ni Lion was worth its price.</p>
 <p>The raw strength of the Golden Ni Lion has now achieved eight thousand nimbus!</p>
 <p>Golden Ni Roar: Could increase the raw strength by ten folds. Passive battle technique, zero consumption.</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni was also a demonic beast which was said to contain powerful dragon bloodline according to legend. The Golden Ni Lion, on the other hand, contained the bloodline of the Golden Ni. The fact that it was able to get this powerful showed that the bloodline within its body was very powerful.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion could achieve an attack prowess worth four hundred thousand nimbus with its most powerful attacks. The Golden Ni Lion mainly specialized in physical attacks. Its attacks contained powerful sharpness as well. They were capable of tearing apart golden jade.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, the current strength of the Golden Ni Lion was considered nothing. But to Qing Sha, it was already a very powerful assistant. Besides, the Golden Ni Lion would continue to evolve and breakthrough as well as go through Blood Awakening in the future. For all he knew, if the conditions allowed, it might even end up a Golden Ni.</p>
