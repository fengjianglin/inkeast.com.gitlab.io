 <p><strong>AST 718 - Returning the the Di Clan</strong></p>
 <p>When Qing Shui was standing at the frontdoor of Di Clan, he felt a sense of familiarity. This was because there were people who were waiting for him here. As the guards standing at the front gate saw Qing Shui, they greeted him politely: “Sir, welcome back.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded. At the moment, Di Clan was now considered to be the major clan in Seven Stars Country. He thought about it for a while, both the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and Ten Thousand Poison Sect died were eliminated by his hand. Furthermore, he shared an extraordinary relationship with Di Clan and Village of Longevity. He had also shared a bit of a relationship with Alchemist Sect. As for the remaining Phoenix Manor and Joyous Valley, he hadn’t had the opportunity to meet them.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui could walk any further, the people from Di Clan had already come out. Both Di Chen and Di Qing were also there. Di Chen in particular, at the moment she saw Qing Shui, the warm smile she gave him made him feel that he was back home.</p>
 <p>Di Qing was also smiling, but she didn’t manage to give Qing Shui that kind of feeling.</p>
 <p>The moment Di Xuan saw Qing Shui, his eyes filled with excitement. The same thing also applied to the others from Di Clan. The youngest people from Di Clan in particular, Di Xian and Di Yao, they looked at Qing Shui with eyes filled with admiration.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the incident in Cold Ice City has been spread here as well. After all, Xijiang Country was the neighbouring country of Seven Stars Country. For incidents like this, it would often be spread at an incredible speed.</p>
 <p>Also, Cold Ice City was a very famous place in Xijiang Country. Luo Clan was the biggest clan in Cold Ice City. Luo Di was someone really famous in a few countries. The most notable thing he did was once destroying an entire clan by himself. He was a formidable warrior who even managed to instant kill a Peak Grade Ten Martial Saint with one technique. Even though a few years have passed since this incident, the people from later generations still remembered it clearly.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui had actually destroyed Luo Clan. How would this not shock them?</p>
 <p>Even though Di Chen and Qing Shui didn’t talk to each other, they were able to understand each other just by making eye contact as well as make out how much concern they had for each other. It was more like how much they had missed each other.</p>
 <p>That kind of worrying was a particularly wonderful thing. At the same time, when Qing Shui felt this kind of worry, he realized there was something similar deep in him too. In fact, the feeling was quite deep. This was already considered love.</p>
 <p>When you love someone, you’d be deeply worried about them.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, you’re so strong!” Di Xian walked to Qing Shui’s side and said happily. She even extended her hand and embraced Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
 <p>Everyone treated her like a little child. Furthermore, Qing Shui could tell that Di Xian looked at him with the same eyes as when she looked at her dad.</p>
 <p>Actually, Di Xian only admired Qing Shui for his formidable cultivation level. Which girl wouldn’t like strong men? Not to mention, Qing Shui was considered half her master.</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui was Di Chen’s husband, he would naturally be considered as half a Di Clan member. Not to mention, Qing Shui had done so many things for Di Clan. Since the incident involving Di Chen had passed, the issue that weighed heavily on everyone’s hearts had also been released. The situation at that time only made Qing Shui upset, he hadn’t really built up any kind of hatred towards them.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, did everything go smoothly?” Di Xuan asked Qing Shui while they were walking towards the main hall. In any case, he’d still have to be polite and talk to Qing Shui with propriety.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it went smoothly. Did anything happen here?” Qing Shui asked casually with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Everything is fine here!”</p>
 <p>As the two were conversing, they’d already entered the main hall. Since it happened to be time for lunch, Di Xuan made the people serve the meals directly to the main hall. In any case, there were not many people from Di Xuan’s family. It wouldn’t really be messy if they’re to eat together.</p>
 <p>Di Chen sat on Qing Shui’s right while Di Qing sat on her right. On the contrary, Di Xian was the one sitting on Qing Shui’s left side. The little brat kept on bugging Qing Shui to tell her about the things in Cold Ice City.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and simply went over it once. At least he told them his stories. Even though the way he way he told it didn’t sound exciting at all, because the story itself was really exciting, everyone felt both nervous and thrilled listening to it.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui came back, Di Clan was filled with a cheerful atmosphere. After finishing lunch, everyone coordinated their timing and left the remaining time for Qing Shui and Di Chen. After all, the two had already been separated from each other for three months.</p>
 <p>Di Qing also didn’t stay behind. Now, even she felt that Qing Shui and Di Chen were already real husband and wife, she didn’t actually know that they’re only a married couple in name.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Chen walked to the room their room together. After not seeing her for three months, now that Qing Shui finally got to reunite with her, he realized that he missed her even more than he used to. His heart wouldn’t stop itching to see her.</p>
 <p>He gently grabbed and rubbed Di Chen’s lily-white hands. The distance between the main hall and their room wasn’t actually that far away. Di Chen looked at Qing Shui with an expression that looked like a smile yet wasn’t a smile. It was his first time seeing her like that.</p>
 <p>As soon as they stepped into their room, Qing Shui conveniently closed the door and immediately embraced Di Chen very tightly. After that, he whispered in her ear: “I don’t really know what’s going on but I realized that I’m missing you more and more.”</p>
 <p>This was considered one of the most pleasant things Qing Shui had ever said. It was a very useful phrase despite the meaning being not so obvious. Originally, Di Chen was still struggling, but now, she was just letting Qing Shui hug her as he liked.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Di Chen hugged Qing Shui gently and whispered to his ear.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. I just had a feeling that i couldn’t wait to get next to you. I wanted to see you really badly, just like now, I wished I could squeeze myself into your body.” Qing Shui licked Di Chen’s earlobe while feeling her curvy body.</p>
 <p>Actually, the ear was a really sensitive part on a lot of people. This was the same for both men and women. Di Chen trembled. As she thought about the words he said previously, she felt both shy and happy.</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er!”</p>
 <p>“Hm, what’s wrong?” Di Chen raised up her head slightly and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I want to kiss you……”</p>
 <p>Di Chen didn’t know what to say. All along, her face was red. Deep down in her heart, she already saw herself as Qing Shui’s woman. Qing Shui kissing her like that caused her to be lost for words. She could only either say no or remain silent. It’s not like she could just nod and accept Qing Shui’s request.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Qing Shui was smart. He lowered down his head and kissed her on her graceful lips. Since Di Chen also had her head slightly lowered down, he could only kiss her with his head bent.</p>
 <p>It was a soft and delicate sensation accompanied by a faint fragrant and refreshing smell. That kind of sensation could cause short circuits in the brain and numbness in the backbone. It was a mysterious and indescribable feeling.</p>
 <p>Di Chen clenched her teeth tightly with her eyes closed. She looked really embarrassed. Qing Shui, on the other hand, slightly sucked on her lips while grabbing and gently stroking her waist.</p>
 <p>Bit by bit, he moved his hand to Di Chen’s bulging buttocks. It wasn’t that huge but it was really bulged up. It had the most beautiful curved line. The instant Qing Shui touched them with his hand, he was stunned with its soft yet springy smoothness.</p>
 <p>Di Chen panicked as soon as Qing Shui touched them. Before she could manage to make any noise, Qing Shui’s tongue intruded into her mouth. Qing Shui madly sucked the bejeweled nectar in her mouth.</p>
 <p>He tightly embraced Di Chen’s waist with one hand while slowly explored her white buttocks with the other. The beautiful sensation caused Qing Shui’s blood to surge up and down. His body had long since begun to undergo some ‘changes’. This made Di Chen so panicked that she bit Qing Shui’s tongue when she felt it.</p>
 <p>Wu-wu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s tongue started bleeding from her bite.</p>
 <p>“It’s so painful, woman, are you planning to bite me to death.” Qing Shui breathed in cold air. Even though it was really painful at first, the pain had begun to fade away now. He couldn’t help but tease her about it.</p>
 <p>“No one told you to recklessly touch me.” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui with a guilty look. After all, she went overboard with her previous bite.</p>
 <p>“Does it hurt? Let me have a look.” Di Chen felt a bit apologetic.</p>
 <p>“It’s so painful! Look, there’s even blood now. Tell me, how are you going to make up for it?” Qing Shui continued to hug her tightly and smiled.</p>
 <p>。</p>
 <p>“You’re still laughing? How do you plan for me to make up for it?” Di Chen also felt a bit apologetic. It's normal for two people to have close contacts with each other together, yet she was behaving like that… hence, she tried to make up for what she did by promising his requests as long as they’re within a certain tolerable range.</p>
 <p>“Close your eyes!” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“What do you want to do?” Di Chen blushed and shot a glare at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>When an extraordinarily outstanding woman like her made this kind of expression, it looked particularly attractive. The expression which looked like she was happy and at the same time angry had a fatal attractiveness to it.</p>
 <p>“Call me your husband… If not, you’re going to let me……” When Qing Shui was saying this, he made a grabbing gesture with his hands. By the time he finished saying it, even Qing Shui himself blushed.</p>
 <p>This was his first time saying something so reckless in front of a woman. Not only so, she was one of the women whom he respected and admired the most. He even felt that this was a challenge for him. Could this be a change which took place as a result of his rise in strength?</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui had become more natural and casual in terms of the way he acted. However, this didn’t mean that Di Chen had become less important to Qing Shui. On the contrary, not only did she not become any less important, she had become even more so. When two people were together, no matter how beautiful a girl looked, she would still want the man she loved to treat her like an ordinary woman instead of a goddess. This was also the reason why Qing Shui tried his best to change himself. He wanted to make Di Chen feel the flirtatious feeling between a man and a woman and the unintentional collision between hearts and some occasional teasings.</p>
 <p>Di Chen still didn’t speak the words that made her shy. She only looked at Qing Shui with an expression which looked like she was smiling but not.</p>
 <p>“Then why don’t you just call me husband?!”</p>
 <p>Like before, Di Chen was still able to give a strong sense of shameful feeling to people whom she came across. But what was different this time was that Qing Shui was a lot more confident than before. For now, he felt blessed to have a woman like her.</p>
 <p>“Husband!” Di Chen finally managed to call it out but she still kept her beautiful head down.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it sounds so good!” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>Di Chen raised her head slightly. She blushed and had a faint smile on her face. But right at this moment, She felt a hand on the front of her bulging chest. She got panicked and as she looked down, she saw Qing Shui’s hand on her breast which no one has ever touched before.</p>
 <p>Di Chen’s delicate body trembled lightly. She grumpily slapped away Qing Shui’s hands: “ You scoundrel!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui however, once again embraced her and gently smiled: “Do you miss me?”</p>
 <p>Di Chen saw Qing Shui didn’t fiddle with her body. The two hugged each other tightly with their heads rubbing against one another. Qing Shui’s voice beside her ear made her feel really comfortable.</p>
 <p>“No I don’t!”</p>
 <p>“Do you really not miss me, or are you just pretending?” Qing Shui smiled gently.</p>
 <p>“I really don’t! I see you everyday in my dreams!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen’s gentle voice made Qing Shui’s body tremble. He subconsciously embraced her tightly. The things that she just said made him feel a few times warmer. Between a man and woman, sometimes, it’d only take one phrase to help elevate their relationship up to an indescribable realm.</p>
