 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ci’s body trembled when she heard what the old man said, then she answered, “For the time being, I am only able to write out the way to cure Dantian. Zhang Miaoyun of the Zhang Clan hasn’t treated his meridians, hence, my master hasn’t taught me that yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man looked at Qing Ci and knew that she was telling the truth. It was already unexpected to be able to force her to hand over the method of treating the Dantian. Actually, the old man never expected to get anything out of Qing Ci. It was just as Qing Ci said, she had only been following Qing Shui for days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was feeling very happy. Who would have expected that Qing Shui would teach Qing Ci something so significant within just a few days? It could be seen, just how much Qing Ci meant to Qing Shui. With that being the case, the plan he devised before would be sure to work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the old man had also found out that the physician of Imperial Cuisine Hall was Qing Shui, a young and powerful physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, write out the section to treat the Dantian.” The old man said after thinking for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will write it out for you. Please don’t hurt my son.” Qing Ci looked at the old man and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, I can assure you that.” The old man said with a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ci took out a pen and started writing on a Beast Parchment. She was writing it out at a decent speed to avoid the old man’s suspicion. She managed to finish it after half an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was holding the Beast Parchment handed over by Qing Ci. Deep down, he was very excited. He was engrossed in looking through the Beast Parchment. It was mysterious, way too mysterious. He was only able to understand a part of it. It seemed like learning this might not be as easy as he thought. After that, he turned his gaze to Qing Ci.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Explain it to me!” The old man said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had a rough idea of the content. Thus, he wanted to see if Qing Ci could explain it to him without making up any lies. If what she said didn’t add up with what he understood, it could only mean that she twisted a part of the theory while writing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ci would naturally know about that. Therefore, she had already expected that something like this would happen. Thus, she didn’t change anything when she was explaining to the old man. This was because she knew that even if the enemies knew about the theory, it would still be hard for them to perform the technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Excitements flashed across the old man’s eyes constantly. With his vast medical knowledge, he naturally knew that Qing Ci was telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you let my child go now!” Qing Ci looked at the old man and asked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now is not the time yet. As an exception, I will let you spend a night with your child. I will let you go, once you hand over the remaining meridians section.” The old man chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You didn’t keep your promises.” Qing Ci looked very furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since when have I backed on my promises. Before this, I intended to chop off your child’s arm. But after you said it, as you can see, his arm is still intact. Could it be that you really want me to chop it off?” The old man looked at Qing Ci with cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ci shivered. A lecherous look flashed across the old man’s eyes. By the time she handed over the things which he wanted, he was sure to play around with her first. He would definitely also kill her child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t agree to it, I will cut off the child’s hand now. If you continue to refuse even tomorrow, I will cut off another one of his hand. When both of his hands are gone, I will go for his legs. When his legs are gone, I will cut off his meat pieces by pieces every day until he dies. Don’t worry, he can at least live for one to two months.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ci went silent. She didn’t scold him because she knew that it would be a futile effort. She didn't know what to do. Qing Shui was her master. She didn’t wish for his consummate skills to be leaked to the public. She felt that the crazy bastard would definitely not let her go even if she handed over what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Mo, mother has already let down her master. We are both saved by our master. I am very sorry… Mother cannot afford to let him down any further.” Qing Ci was crying as she embraced her child and kept on repeating the same words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s expression immediately darkened. He never expected for things to take such a turn. At this moment, he said in a gloomy tone, “Alright, since that’s the case, watch me as I cut off the fingers of your son one by one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the old man was speaking, he stood up and took up a pair of sharp scissors, “I will use this to cut off your son’s fingers one by one. Tell me, do you think it will hurt?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t, you can cut off mine instead. Please let go of my child.” Qing Ci’s face looked extremely pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As long as you keep your promises, I can assure you that he will be safe and be served with good food and clothes. He can have whatever he wants. I promise. You will die if you don’t think for yourself. Do you really want to see your child dying at such a young age? He still has a long way to go. He has a bright future.” The old man planned to attack Qing Ci’s mind little by little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She no longer has to agree with you. I will do it on her behalf.” A voice went into the old man’s ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was very shocked. He turned around only to see that the door to his room had been opened. A young man appeared at the entrance with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you? Oh, there you are. I was just thinking about how to get you to show up. This is great. You turned up on your own.” Initially, the old man was very shocked. But after that, he calmed down gradually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man glanced at Qing Ci and Little Mo, and immediately took them hostage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already expected such a move from his opponent. His figure flashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Palace Step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately charged head-on without even thinking about defending himself. He swiftly thrust his fist out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man landed his fist on Qing Shui’s chest. When that happened, he felt a sense of joy. “It seemed this person was only good at his medical skills.” thought the old man. However, before he managed to retract this thought, he immediately suffered a punch in his shoulder. It felt as if he was bitten by a poisonous snake. It was painful, his entire arm got so soft, to the point that he couldn’t muster up even the slightest strength to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, Qing Shui landed his elbow on the opponent’s shoulder. The old man was hit and stepped back. Qing Shui then extended his hand and grabbed the opponent’s Quchi acupoint which was located on his arm. A thread of Nine Yang Force went into his body. Almost simultaneously, Qing Shui pulled back his left hand that was grabbing on the Quchi Acupoint and with his right hand, he knocked the middle joint of the old man’s arm with his Tyrant Cauldron. Only this time, he hit it from the opposite direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ka-cha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud and clear bone-cracking noise came through. Following on, the old man screamed in pain. Qing Shui didn’t stop. He was like a machine as he skillfully crushed a lot of the old man’s joints. His Acupoints were also being attacked one by one. Qing Shui’s way of attacking was very unique. It had a lot of strength, and he also targeted the vital points throughout a human’s body. The noises of bones cracking could be heard from time to time. What accompanied it was the old man’s miserable shrieking noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wouldn’t hold back against people like this. It was to the extent that he felt it was a pity if the old man died an immediate death. Didn’t he want to cut off Little Mo’s arm? Qing Shui realized his wish by crippling his arm instead. Cutting it off was too bloody. Thus, Qing Shui decided to go with crushing both of his arms instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only his arms. Even his legs were completely crushed. In a moment, it was as if the old man had become a mollusk. Blood could be seen dripping out of his mouth and nose. His organs had also been damaged and quite a lot of his chest bones cracked. However, he was still able to stay alive for the time being. Though that was the case, with the way Qing Shui dealt with things, he also wouldn’t let him live. For now, he could do nothing but withstand these pains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without having to think about it, Qing Shui could already figure out that this person had too much blood on his hands. It was not a huge thing to kill people in the World of the Nine Continents. But this would also depend on who the person was trying to kill. Regardless of the reason, Qing Shui despised being forced by other people with this kind of method the most. If they decided to do that, they must be prepared to face his rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the two middle-aged men were already so scared that they collapsed on the floor. It would be unreal if they could still move after seeing the old man’s pathetic appearance now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the two men, “You were the ones who kidnapped the child. Break your own arms and get out of here. I can’t guarantee your safety when I start making my moves a while later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the other two people coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two people hesitated for a while before they finally picked up an iron rod and knocked it on their arm. A depressing noise came through. As for their other hand, they knocked it against the wall and as they did so, the loud and clear bone-cracking noises were heard. The other person also did the same thing after seeing the pathetic look of the old man on the ground. After that, he looked at Qing Shui with sweats all over his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui waved his hand. He still needed someone to spread this information for him. He believed that soon enough, a lot of people would come. This place was the old man’s private mansion. Because the old man was very strong, usually, there wouldn’t be anyone around here. No one would dare to come and bother him.</span></p>
