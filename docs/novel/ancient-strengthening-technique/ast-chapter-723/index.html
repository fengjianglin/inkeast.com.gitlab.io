 <p><strong>AST 723 - Great benefits, Returning to the Qing Clan, Recovery of Memories</strong></p>
 <p>Red Cloud Chicken?</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw a red colored chicken fly by, he used a strand of wind to knock it down. Dinner had fallen from the sky, Qing Shui looked at that chicken, it was about two-thirds of a meter, its body looked like red clouds and it could fly.</p>
 <p>The Red Cloud Chicken tasted wonderful, it could be classified as a low-grade medicinal ingredient. It could only grow in this kind of place with red soil.</p>
 <p>It was sold in other places as well but it was expensive. It was a luxury good for the rich clans because its taste was very attractive.</p>
 <p>This day was very exciting and awkward for Qing Shui, after that spiritual Duo Cultivation, he felt another kind of excitement when he faced Di Chen, especially when their gazes met, the feeling caused Qing Shui’s body to go soft.</p>
 <p>When it was night, Qing Shui released all the Demonic Beasts then entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>After checking, he realized he had made huge improvements from this Duo Cultivation of the consciousness with Di Chen, it had directly caused the Ancient Strengthening Technique to break through to the Peak of the 6th layer, which would have required a period of time before he could have done so.</p>
 <p>Earlier he only broke through to the 375th cycle, now, it was at the 399th cycle. Maybe it was because he was at the peak of the 6th layer, Qing Shui’s body’s abilities went from 1500 countries to 2000 countries.</p>
 <p>His bodies' abilities had increased by 500 countries…… the Everlasting Pellet had only increased his abilities by 700 countries. That was the result of the effort of a long period of time. He felt joy when he achieved it since he had been looking forward to it for quite a period of time, this time it seemed too simple.</p>
 <p>The valiant Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui had obtained an incredible benefit on that day. Going by the regular pace, including the fact he had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would require at least three years of time in the real world. This was because the Ancient Strengthening Technique got more difficult the further he progressed. He had obtained an incredible benefit by Duo Cultivating with Di Chen in their consciousnesses.</p>
 <p>It was also the result of the method of the Duo Cultivation Technique, a Duo Cultivation of the consciousness was better than one of the body. Duo Cultivation was not a cultivation that focused purely on the body, a Duo Cultivation of the body was actually of the lowest grade but it would not be ignored by people.</p>
 <p>Regaining the natural state, the highest realm of Duo Cultivation was the combination of the body or soul!</p>
 <p>The other thing that caused Qing Shui to be happy was that Di Chen’s abilities had also significantly increased, she was now a Grade Four Martial Saint. Qing Shui felt that her abilities would continue to rise even faster, this exchange of yin and yang had stimulated her potential.</p>
 <p>He thought of Canghai Mingyue, she was also a woman of the Portrait of Beauty. But they did not experience a rapid improvement of strength on this level. Was it because it happened in the dream among the sea of flowers……</p>
 <p>This was a joyful surprise, which man did not look forward to increasing their abilities with such a method…...</p>
 <p>His abilities had increased so much, the State of Immovable as Mountains had also improved to Grade Four. This time, when Qing Shui picked up the Thunder God, when all his abilities were added up, it was exactly at 20000 countries.</p>
 <p>The abilities of 20000 countries, Qing Shui wanted to laugh when he thought of it. This time, it could be considered as Qing Shui stepping into that realm, even if it was at the bottom, he had finally achieved it.</p>
 <p>Following this was cultivation, he familiarized himself with the increased strength in his body, he would do this every day. When Qing Shui was free, he would take a walk around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It felt substantial, every time he made a major improvement in abilities, obtained strong medicinal herbs or fruits, there was a strong sense of satisfaction.</p>
 <p>This time, his abilities improved significantly, the peak of the sixth layer. Qing Shui knew that it would be difficult to break into the seventh layer because the Ancient Strengthening Technique was separated into nine layers and three realms.</p>
 <p>The first realm, the first to third layers, the small success of divine technique!</p>
 <p>The second realm, the fourth to sixth layers, entering a higher level!</p>
 <p>The third realm, the seventh to ninth layers, looking down on the heavens and earth!</p>
 <p>It was definitely not easy to break through to the seventh layer, thus Qing Shui was prepared to cultivate for a long time. However, he was satisfied for now, he still had other ways to improve his strength. Now, he had to consolidate his strength until could use it as he liked.</p>
 <p>His relationship with Di Chen also ‘broke through’, Duo Cultivating with the consciousness was not inferior to a physical relationship, there would be no more secrets between the two of them.</p>
 <p>When he thought about his profits for the day, Qing Shui felt elated in his heart. He then felt more motivated to cultivate, only by being strong, could he protect everything he had.</p>
 <p>In the past, his abilities could not keep up with his cultivation realm. Now he felt that the speed of advancement of his cultivation was lacking. Thus, Qing Shui knew that his level of abilities would enter into a slow growth phase, he had to consolidate his strength and stabilize his cultivation before advancing.</p>
 <p>To be precise, Qing Shui’s cultivation was not low, just that his abilities grew too fast, he needed some time to digest, with the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it would not take too long.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>One month later, Greencloud Continent was visible in the distance. He carried Di Chen and after a Nine Continents Steps, he appeared on the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>Within the month, they had returned back to how they were before, actually, Qing Shui did not feel awkward, Di Chen slowly let go of the matter as well but she would still not let Qing Shui overstep the bounds of propriety in reality.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui agreed to give her some time, that he would not make her do anything she did not want to. In the one month, Qing Shui had shamelessly thought of it twice, it happened at night too, causing Di Chen to not be able to rest at night, she then had to pretend nothing had happened the next day.</p>
 <p>Greencloud Continent City was near the borders of Central Continent, thus when Qing Shui entered the Greencloud Continent he was not far from Greencloud Continent City. This was not the first time he left and returned from afar but every time he was just as eager to return home.</p>
 <p>Riding on the Fire Bird, they headed towards the Qing Clan. When they saw the Greencloud Continent City, Qing Shui felt a sense of familiarity. This was a sense that Qing Shui could understand, it was a feeling like leaving his nation then returning to it.</p>
 <p>When he was nearby the Qing Clan, he put away the Fire Bird and descended slowly with Di Chen. They then headed towards the Qing Clan, without realizing it, he had been gone from the Qing Clan for almost two years.</p>
 <p>“Brother, you have returned!” When they entered, Qing Shui and Di Chen encountered Qing Bei, When she saw Qing Shui, she was shocked then ran over joyfully, she hugged one of Qing Shui’s arm then looked at Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen smiled as she exchanged greetings with Qing Bei.</p>
 <p>“Everything alright at home?” Qing Shui smile at the Qing Bei, who was now a slender and elegant woman,</p>
 <p>Qing Bei was now almost 27 years old, she was now a great beauty, in addition to her talent and cultivation, as well as the fact that the Qing Clan was the top clan, there were many people who came to propose marriage, only to be rejected.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>“Sister!”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui raised his head, he saw Qing Qing, He hurriedly and quickly greeted that quiet and beautiful girl. This was the person closest to him in terms of his bloodline.</p>
 <p>“You have returned!” Qing Qing had a happy expression as she said that, it was rare for her to smile this happily, very rare. Qing Shui knew that after the matter in Yan Jiang Country, she started smiling.</p>
 <p>“Mn, how about mother and the rest?” Qing Shui walked over and gave her a light hug. He intended to give this sister a lot of concern, making her feel even more warmth.</p>
 <p>“They are in the backyard.”</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, Qing Yi brought two fair children to the front yard, she saw Qing Shui and he saw Qing Yi as well.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui is back!” Qing Yi could not help but tear up, this was a pleasant surprise.</p>
 <p>From when he come of age at the age of 16, it had been about fourteen years, Qing Shui was basically rarely at home. He had always been fighting outside, before there was the Qing Clan of today, everything Qing Clan had was given to them by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Mother, your son is back, why are you crying? Are you not happy?” Qing Shui smiled as he hugged Qing Yi.</p>
 <p>“Mother is happy.” Qing Yi smiled as she stretched her hand out to rub Qing Shui’s head, now Qing Shui was taller than her by half a head.</p>
 <p>Unconsciously, Qing Yi saw the two fellows below curiously watching them. Although they had grown quite big, Qing Shui could still make out the resemblance to what they looked like when he had left.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, after leaving for so long, why are you not hugging your kids yet?” Qing Yi turned around and took a step back to allow the two fellows to come to the front.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and knelt down, looking at the two fellows: “Zun`er, Yin`er, do you remember daddy?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t!” Although a three-year-old kid understood some stuff, when Qing Shui left, they were only 1 year olds, of course, they could not remember.</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Lui-Li, and the others came out.</p>
 <p>“Mother!”</p>
 <p>The two fellows ran towards Canghai Mingyue, leaving Qing Shui behind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could only rub his nose and smile bitterly, he had no other choice. Di Chen stood to the side laughing at Qing Shui’s awkward appearance.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue carried them up, one in each hand.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this woman, who look as beautiful as she did before, that gorgeous temperamental woman was looking gently looking at Qing Shui, there was a look of longing in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Mingyue, Lui-Li, Gelou, Wu-shuang, Qingzhuang……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at them, smiled and called out to them, he found that that aside from Yiye Jiange, they were all gathered there. Qing Shui was very puzzled but was very happy, this was good as well.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li hugged Qing Shui, she did not care that there were many people watching, she just missed Qing Shui, hugging him could relieve some of that deep longing.</p>
 <p>She hugged him tightly before releasing him quite a while later, Qing Shui then hugged Mingyue Gelou and Shi Qingzhuang. Just when Qing Shui was about to skip past Wenren Wu-shuang, he heard Wenren Wu-shuang’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I am Wu-shuang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked that the beautiful woman smiling faintly at him, her eyes were filled with tears, then he hugged her: “Wu-shuang, you recovered your memories.”</p>
 <p>“Mn, I recovered them, I remember everything now.” Wenren Wu-shuang smiled, her tears kept trickling down.</p>
 <p>After a long while, Wenren Wu-shuang released Qing Shui, her face was very red, this beauty was very traditional, now that she recovered her memories, she recalled their past relationship.</p>
 <p>“Come, let daddy carry you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried to extend his hands out to his kids once again.</p>
 <p>“No!” the two fellows shouted out together before hugging Canghai Mingyue tightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was helpless, after leaving for two years, his children could no longer recognize him.</p>
 <p>“Zun`er, Yin`er, haven’t you always wanted to meet your father? That is him.” Canghai Mingyue smiled gently and told them.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui…...</p>
