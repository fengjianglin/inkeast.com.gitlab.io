 <p><strong>AST 741 - Five Colored Poison Beast, Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable</strong></p>
 <p>Treasure chamber?</p>
 <p>Although they saw treasures before them, they hesitated. They kept having the feeling that there was a strong killing intent hidden behind those tempting treasures. Just as they were hesitating, a surge of power came from behind them, forcing them to inexorably dash into the treasure chamber.</p>
 <p>There were initially many light stones along the passageways, but after they've dashed into the treasure chamber, the big door made of unknown material closed up.</p>
 <p>There were no light stones in the secret chamber, but the sparkling gleams from those treasures were even more dazzling that light stones. However, these gleams made them feel unease.</p>
 <p>"Zuoshi Yangcan, come out if you dare. Why are you being such a coward?" Liu Zilang shouted out. He knew that he had been tricked. He had initially thought that they could just retreat if things didn't turn out well, but he hadn't expected the push from earlier to be so great that there was nowhere to retreat to anymore.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, fool, so what if I'm acting cowardly? I wonder if you guys are pleased to be dying here?"</p>
 <p>"Zuoshi Yangcan, how about we come to an agreement?" One of the two elderly men from the Liu Clan spoke out.</p>
 <p>"Agreement? What a joke. What do we have to discuss?" Zuoshi Yangcan laughed.</p>
 <p>"There is something. Don’t you hate the Qing Clan? Do you want Qing Shui to die?" The old man's voice seemed to have a certain charm to it, causing Zuoshi Yangcan to fall silent.</p>
 <p>No matter what, the Zuoshi Clan had been eradicated by that lad. The blood that flowed in him was from the Zuoshi Clan and as long as he was alive, he would need to do his part for the Zuoshi Clan.</p>
 <p>"Haha, so what? Even someone at Zuoshi Ziyan's level had died. Who would be able to do anything to the Qing Clan?" Although Zuoshi Yangcan knew that nothing would come out from listening to the crap the Liu Clan was saying, he could not help but feel curious of what they have to say.</p>
 <p>"There're many ways to kill a person. There's poison, threats and borrowing the hands of others to get the job done. No matter what, as long as the goal is reached, it's a good method. What do you think?" Liu Zijiang said slowly, his tone very calm.</p>
 <p>"Poison? You must be kidding. What’s scary is that young man’s poisons. Borrowing someone's hands to get the job done? Haha, you guys are on your deathbeds now and are just trying to say all these so that I'll let you off. If I were to let you go, wouldn’t you immediately work together to get me killed?" Zuoshi Yangcan said in contempt.</p>
 <p>"You're right, I can't get help from other people. However, our Liu Clan had just gotten our hands on a Poison Beast recently. It’s called the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. You must have heard of its name before."</p>
 <p>"Five Colored Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable?" Zuoshi Yangcan asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>"That's right, you should believe my words now." Liu Zijian smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I wonder who had tamed that Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable? Don't tell me that it hasn't been tamed yet." Zuoshi Yangcan smiled coldly and said, a hint of contempt in his voice.</p>
 <p>"This..."</p>
 <p>"Liu Zijiang, do you really think that I don't know the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable? None of you guys in the Liu Clan has been able to tame that Poison Beast yet? You deserve to die!" Zuoshi Yangcan said furiously.</p>
 <p>No one would like to be treated like a fool and to be tricked. That was why Zuoshi Yangcan was in great fury now and bellowed that he was going to kill them all.</p>
 <p>"It's true that we've gotten our hands on a Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. We'd caught it with the Heavenly Silk Net left behind in our Liu Clan. It was just that there's no one who could tame it. Do you want to try your luck?" Liu Zijiang was breaking out in sweat but he still said calmly with a smile.</p>
 <p>"You guys can stay here for now. How about I get them to bring the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable to exchange it for you guys? " Zuoshi Yangcan kept quiet after saying this.</p>
 <p>"Brother, what should we do?" Liu Zilang asked, vexed.</p>
 <p>"Brother, will he really let us go with this?" Another elderly also asked, trembling.</p>
 <p>"If you were him, will you let us off?" Liu Zijiang smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"No!"</p>
 <p>"That settles it." Liu Zijiang smiled and found a spot to sit. He now felt nothing when looking at this pile of valuable treasures. Compared to life, all valuable things were worthless.</p>
 <p>Everyone understood now. Dragging it out for a little longer was better than being killed immediately. There might be some chance. They all showed admiration for Liu Zijiang's acceptance toward this.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The remaining four people from the Liu Clan continued to walk around in circles at the entrance. Qing Shui was looking on at this scene from a little distance away. He was not in a hurry. He decided to first take a look and see how badly the people from the Liu Clan would be thrashed by Zuoshi Yangcan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled when he saw Zuoshi Yangcan coming out from that passageway. The few people from earlier must have been kept under control even if they had not died.</p>
 <p>"I'll give you guys two hours to bring the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable over. If it's not here within two hours, you guys can be prepared to clean up their corpses." Zuoshi Yangcan looked at the remaining four from the Liu Clan, smiled coldly and said.</p>
 <p>"Let us take a look at Eldest Brother and the rest." Someone shouted out to Zuoshi Yangcan.</p>
 <p>"The time has already started. Remember, two hours. If you guys were to delay any longer, even if the beast was brought here, you guys can do nothing but clean up their corpses."</p>
 <p>"Old Six, I'll head back and bring it over. The three of you stay on guard here." An elder from Liu Clan called out for his ride and flew off quickly.</p>
 <p>Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable？</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard that. He had came across this Poison Beast in the Poison Beast section of the Unusual demonic beast’s encyclopedia before. It belonged to the category of the rare Five Colored Poison Beasts and was hard to come across. Its size was smaller than two feet, and it was quick as lightning, covered with poison all over.</p>
 <p>The only reason Qing Shui knew so much about it was because there was the mention of a method to tame it in the [Poison Scriptures]. As long as one fed it with the Flower of Life, the person would be able to tame it immediately and it wouldn't betray its owner in its whole life. This was what that was recorded in the Poison Scriptures and he didn't know if it was true.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui decided that he must definitely get his hands on this Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable, even if he had to give up on the Zuoshi Clan's treasure chamber. Time always seemed to pass slowly when one was waiting. Qing Shui couldn't guess if the Liu Clan's members were dead or still alive.</p>
 <p>During this time, Zuoshi Yangcan had come out once. With regards to the pestering of the remaining three Liu Clan members, he didn't give a hoot and just headed back into the treasure chamber.</p>
 <p>After a while, time was up and Zuoshi Yangcan came out. He stayed at the entrance, occasionally looking out silently, occasionally looking toward the sky.</p>
 <p>"Zuoshi Yangcan, there's no bitter grudges between our clans. There's no need to go to such lengths to kill us all. We can talk this over." An old man put up a forced smile and said to Zuoshi Yangcan.</p>
 <p>"Earlier when you guys were trying to kill me together, why didn't you ask to talk it over? Why didn't you say that there's no need to go through such lengths to kill? To think that you're so thick-skinned to still dare say such words..." Zuoshi Yangcan looked at the old man in contempt.</p>
 <p>Just then, a loud cry rang out in the sky. It was the other old man who had returned back to the Liu Clan earlier. He was holding onto a great net with a small beast crying out in it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's gaze was locked on that small beast which was less than 2 feet long and covered in a pretty violet color. Just from its appearance alone, no one would believe that such a beautiful little beast would be an extremely toxic Poison Beast.</p>
 <p>Five Colored Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also got his eyes on that Heavenly Silk Net. The Heavenly Silk Net was also a treasure. The Heavenly Silkworm was not a demonic beast but the Heavenly Silk it produced was a great treasure because it could fight against poison and was sturdy.</p>
 <p>There was a type of garment which was made from Heavenly Silk, just like the Lunar Silk Garment Qing Shui had on. however, their attributes were different. Both the Heavenly Silkworm and Lunar Silkworm were mutated species and it was hard to find one in a hundred years.</p>
 <p>The old man carefully held onto the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable and walked up to the door. "I've already brought the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable here. Now you should let our Eldest Brother and the others go."</p>
 <p>"Liu Ziyang, are you really an idiot or are you just pretending to be one? Did I say that I would let them go? Do you think it's possible for me to let them go?" Zuoshi Yangcan let out a snort and said.</p>
 <p>"Then what do I get from giving you the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable?" Liu Ziyang was so angry that his face had turned red.</p>
 <p>"It's in exchange for me not killing them immediately. How about it, do you want to trade?"</p>
 <p>"You..."</p>
 <p>"If you don't wish to trade, I can chuck out their corpses immediately." Zuoshi Yangcan looked at Liu Ziyang with great interest and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright, I'll give it to you, I'll give it to you." Sweat broke out on Liu Ziyang's forehead.</p>
 <p>When he wiped off his sweat a hint of determination flashed in his eyes. He then put down the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable on the ground and signalled for Zuoshi Yangcan to come over and get it.</p>
 <p>"Come over and put it closer!"</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Yangcan wasn't one who could be so easily deceived.</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright!" Liu Ziyang quickly agreed before walking over slowly toward the entrance. As he walked he kept asking if it was close enough.</p>
 <p>"Alright, just leave it there." Zuoshi Yangcan said loudly to Liu Ziyang.</p>
 <p>In the records, anyone had the chance to tame the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. Although the chances were not high, he wouldn't have done himself justice if he didn't try while it was in the Heavenly Silk Net. Zuoshi Yangcan also hoped that his luck was extremely good. If he could tame this Five Colored Poison Beast, he would be able to kill these few people before him in seconds.</p>
 <p>Liu Ziyang put it down slowly and then got up slowly. Before he let go of the hand that was grabbing onto the Heavenly Silk Net, he suddenly threw it toward Zuoshi Yangcan and he had even opened up the net in advance.</p>
 <p>Squeak squeak!</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Yangcan's countenance turned grim and he quickly ran in toward the passageway. However, his speed was far from being a match for the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>When Zuoshi Yangcan felt as if he was about to be hit by the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable, he immediately struck out his palm toward it.</p>
 <p>Although he managed to send the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable flying, his hand was already bleeding while the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was unharmed. This creature appeared to be very soft but could withstand impact. Its flexibility was extremely high, it was as if he had punch into a lump of cotton floating the air, with 99% of the force dissipated.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Yangcan saw that there was blood in his hand and before he had the time to feel any pain, he was struck by darkness and fell unconscious. Or rather, he had already died.</p>
 <p>Liu Ziyang was elated to see that Zuoshi Yangcan had died. In his heart, Eldest Brother and the others had already died. Now, the treasures and the entire Liu Clan would be his.</p>
 <p>It was just that he had no time to be happy as he noticed that the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was charging toward him. His heart almost jumped out of his mouth. It was also by chance that Liu Clan had managed to capture the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable with the Heavenly Silk Net. Earlier, he had been forced to release it, but it seemed like he was going to suffer from his own malicious actions...</p>
 <p>It was an undoubtedly instant kill. The poison from the Five Colored Poison Beast together with the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable's speed was really a devilish existence. This was a poison that even a Peak Martial Saint was not able to withstand, let alone people like themselves.</p>
