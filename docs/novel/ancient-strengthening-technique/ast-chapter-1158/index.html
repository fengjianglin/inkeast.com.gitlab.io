 <p><strong>AST 1158 - Joyous Sage, Strength Infusion, The Wishing Goddess Statue</strong></p>
 <p>The old man spoke suddenly. Qing Shui was taken aback, especially at his words. He looked at the old man in amazement. Regardless if the old man was an expert or if he was a diviner, it didn’t matter anymore because he felt that these words were very useful to him.</p>
 <p>He had already thought about what to do in the future back then but now, he felt as if his opinion on this matter had been approved by someone else. He smiled at the old man, “Old Man, how should I address you?”</p>
 <p>“I call myself the Joyous Sage but everyone else calls me a lunatic. Little Brother, do you think I am a lunatic?” the old man answered, he seemed to be particularly happy.</p>
 <p>“It is said that geniuses are all lunatics and experts are all lunatics too. Experts are people whom ordinary people will never understand. Otherwise, anyone can be an expert. Old Man, I think you are definitely a sage.” Qing Shui didn’t know what he felt either when he said this. He was very serious but was also casually saying it at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, young man, it seems like we will get along well. Alright then, we shall be friends, if you are willing to, Little Brother,” the old man laughed heartily.</p>
 <p>“I couldn’t ask for more, Old Man……”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you call me Brother from now on? Calling me that feels too strange. We are friends in spite of the difference in our ages.” The old man looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Then I shall stop being courteous, Brother.” This was a little beyond Qing Shui’s belief. After all, they were going to address one another in great familiarity despite having just met. On top of that, there was also a huge age gap between them. Even so, he seemed to be thinking that this would be interesting but also seemed to be serious.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, that’s more like it. This old man is very happy today. Brother has nothing good to give you, so I’ll grant you a little fortune!” The old man casually reached out and placed his forefinger on the top of Qing Shui’s head.</p>
 <p>It was only now Qing Shui realized the terrifying strength of the old man because for that instant, his body couldn’t budge even an inch. However, he had a feeling that the old man wouldn’t harm him. Very soon enough, a wave of miraculous energy was channeled into his body and the next thing he knew, his entire body felt as if it was being filled with Qi.</p>
 <p>Strength Infusion!</p>
 <p>To his surprise, it turned out to be Strength Infusion. In legend, only powerful cultivators could use their life essence to perform Strength Infusion for someone else. This could directly enhance one’s cultivation. However, this kind of Strength Infusion was particularly expensive to one’s true origin energy and could even lower the user’s cultivation. Other than people who were about to die, the ones that had this ability would only perform Strength Infusion on their juniors. However, the amount of strength that could be absorbed would all depend on each individual’s aptitude and fortune.</p>
 <p>This old man actually performed Strength Infusion on him? Qing Shui felt like everything was too good to be true. He was also mostly puzzled.</p>
 <p>BAM!</p>
 <p>It was as if a furnace had exploded within his body. The miraculous energy of the old man gushed forth directly from Tianling acupoint into the dantian of his body. However, it was obstructed by the Nine Continents Mountain of his dantian instead.</p>
 <p>But it was able to only withstand a few impacts before there was an explosion within his dantian. A wave of intense warm current circulated within his body. This was the divine force within his own body. Qing Shui was hit by a surprise next. There were some changes in the Nine Continents Mountain once again.</p>
 <p>Although it didn’t have any changes in its appearance, the Nine Continent Mountain in his dantian appeared to be heavier and more majestic. The domineering aura that it exuded had become even more powerful than before. It made one feel like the Sky Penetrating Mountains were towering before them.</p>
 <p>It felt just like how the Nine Continents Mountain acknowledged him as its owner back then.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed it, a look of extreme surprise then appeared on his face. The Nine Continents Mountain had leveled up.</p>
 <p>Sacred Object of Heaven and Earth, the Nine Continents Mountain, treasure type. The condensation of pure stones between Heaven and Earth that formed after absorbing the power essence of the sun and moon over countless years. Treasure of Sacred Spirit Grade. Successfully refined.</p>
 <p>An increase of two nimbus (one nimbus is equivalent to 10,000 stars of strength) of physical strength and 10,000 stars of spirit energy. With its current twofold of strength and twofold of speed to knockback and attack, its attack carried the Shield Attack energy. It could move with spirit energy, controlled by his will! It could level up!</p>
 <p>In terms of the original foundation, this is equivalent to increasing one nimbus of physical strength. However, Qing Shui was a little disappointed that the Nine Continents Mountain was still attacking with twofold strength and twofold speed. He wondered if it would continue in upgrading to threefold or fourfold.</p>
 <p>Not only that, there were also some changes in the nebula in his sea of consciousness. It had doubled in size. The spirit energy it held also became thicker. This was only a change in his reserves, it didn’t increase the strength again.</p>
 <p>The old man had already retracted his hand and was looking at Qing Shui. “Not bad, Brother. The destiny of these two girls will intertwine with yours in the future,” he chuckled.</p>
 <p>As soon as the old man finished speaking, he ignored the strange looks that the two ladies were giving him and reached out with both of his hands to point on the top of the ladies’ heads without direct contact. This time, Qing Shui saw that pure living aura. The Origin Qi, Divine Energy, True Origin Qi and others within the body were like oil but what the Old Man channeled in was like fiery stars. It ignited the functions of the body and unlocked the potentials within that body.</p>
 <p>After about only seven minutes, the two ladies immediately bowed towards the old man. “Thank you, Old Master!”</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t say anything further. He looked at Qing Shui. “You still have a very long journey ahead of you. We will meet again in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Brother, you are leaving?” Qing Shui stared at the old man in surprise. To be honest, he was a little reluctant to part with such a powerful figure. Furthermore, he was clueless about everything here and didn’t know anything. He only knew this old man who called himself the Joyous Sage.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. I have already made plans to settle some things long ago, so I am leaving tomorrow. I didn’t expect to meet you here today, Brother. This is probably the work of fate. Rest assured, we will meet again in the future.” The extremely positive old man laughed happily.</p>
 <p>“Well then, let me treat you to some wine, Brother!”</p>
 <p>“Brother, you are being too courteous. The bond between brothers comes from the heart!” The joyous old man shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Fine then, I shall stop being courteous with you, Brother. At least it’s not too much to be giving Brother some gifts, right?” Qing Shui shoved an Interspatial Silk Sachet into the old man’s arms.</p>
 <p>The old man looked at the Interspatial Silk Sachet and then nodded with a smile!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had stashed quite a lot of wine in the Interspatial Silk Sachet. He felt that these were the only things that were most suitable and were at least decent enough to be gifts.</p>
 <p>The old man sent Qing Shui and the two ladies off. When Qing Shui and the two ladies were quite some distance away, the old man watched after Qing Shui’s disappearing silhouette. The smile on his face remained.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the two ladies still felt slightly muddle-headed. Everything seemed like a dream. However, the tremendous strengths currently in their bodies told them otherwise.</p>
 <p>The aptitudes of the two ladies were extraordinary. Compared to them, Qing Shui had gotten greater benefits from the Strength Infusion this time. The current strength of Tantai Xuan was approximately 400 nimbus, while Yu Ruyan had actually attained 100 nimbus. It was evident that the power of Strength Infusion was indeed formidable.</p>
 <p>For the old man to perform Strength Infusion, his cultivation would be lowered. This was also the fact that Qing Shui and the two ladies couldn’t wrap their heads around. Why would he make such sacrifice for people whom he had met for the first time? Everything that had happened was simply too unimaginable.</p>
 <p>The two ladies were portrayed on the Portraits of Beauty. For Yu Ruyan in particular, her increase in strength was the most terrifying among all of them. She had asked Qing Shui a few times if all this was true and if her strength would vanish when she woke up the next day. Qing Shui could understand her uncertainties too well.</p>
 <p>Even Qing Shui felt as if this was all a dream himself, let alone the two ladies. This Strength Infusion had immediately leveled up his Nine Continents Mountain. A seeming increase of one nimbus of physical strengths turned out to be eight nimbus in actuality. Overall, that was about 100 nimbus of increase in total. For Nine Continents Mountain, that was an increase of more than 200 nimbus.</p>
 <p>But these were not all the benefits because there were also some changes in that nebula in his sea of consciousness. Qing Shui believed that it would allow his strength to be increased once again very soon.</p>
 <p>Compared to Qing Shui, the increment in the two ladies’ strengths could be described as terrifying. This made Qing Shui have a feeling that this had some relation to one’s aptitude and constitution. The Strength Infusion this time had increased Tantai Xuan’s strength a few times. How terrifying. The most terrifying one was Yu Ruyan. It could be said that she had soared up into the sky with one step. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be repeatedly asking Qing Shui if everything had been real.</p>
 <p>Regardless, this was pure fortune. The three of them continued walking in the direction of the Wishing Stone. Qing Shui was actually pondering about one question on the entire journey. The two ladies’ strengths were all increased a few times or even tens of times while the increase in his strength seemed to be a little too pitiful. Did this mean that his aptitude, skeleton, constitution and perception were inferior to the two ladies?</p>
 <p>But he was able to deny it very quickly. He felt that his perception wasn’t any weaker than them. As for constitution, he possessed the Nine Yang Golden Body. Then why was his increment in strength that little?</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan’s strength was the weakest among them, yet she received the most increment in strength out of them all. Although Tantai Xuan’s strength had been increased by quite a lot, it was still a lot less than Yu Ruyan. In addition, his strength was also increased by a lot less than Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, Strength Infusion is the direct channeling of strength. After comparing the amount that we have absorbed, the Old Man probably channeled more than 100 nimbus of energy,” Qing Shui conjectured.</p>
 <p>Strength Infusion could unlock potentials. Yu Ruyan was weak in strength, but she possessed the Divine Body and had great potential within her. Hence, her strength was suddenly increased tremendously. Even so, there was still a limiting factor. That would be how much potential in strength the old man’s Strength Infusion could unlock.</p>
 <p>Following that line of logic, Qing Shui knew that this had nothing to do with his aptitude or innate talents but his strength instead. After all, the feelings of 10 nimbus being increased to 100 nimbus, about more than 200 nimbus to 400 nimbus and 1,200 nimbus to more than 1,400 nimbus were different.</p>
 <p>In comparison, it was still Qing Shui who had gotten the greatest increase in strength. However, Yu Ruyan, who got the least increase, looked like she had the most increment among them instead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt more assured after he figured all this out. Soon enough, the Wishing Stone appeared up ahead within their sight. Most people were gathered here. There was an enormous pond in this area and artificial mountains in the pond. There were also stone steps and stone bridges that extended towards the center of the pond. A gigantic stone statue stood in the midst of the pond.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, look, that’s the Wishing Goddess Statue!” Yu Ruyan pointed at the stone statue in the center and exclaimed.</p>
 <p>There were many people standing around the stone statue with their eyes closed in the surroundings. Their lips were slightly moving, as if mumbling something. But of course, there were also some who only had their eyes shut with their palms put together, as if in prayer.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, let’s go over there and make a wish too! It’s very effective!” Yu Ruyan pulled Qing Shui with one hand and Tantai Xuan with her other hand as they made their way to the front of the Goddess statue.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched the woman who was pulling him. There was another hint of a delicate girl within her maturity. Her kingdom-toppling beauty appeared even more beautiful and alluring right now. Watching her gave him a sense of contentment in his heart.</p>
 <p>Since they were here, they might as well make a wish. It was a blessing for one to have wishes. As long as one had wishes, they would feel extremely blessed when they came true. Just like him, if he could find Di Chen or unite the entire clan together or find that man or find that woman who was in the crystal coffin…...</p>
 <p>These were all his wishes. He looked towards Yu Ruyan. “Ruyan, can I make multiple wishes?”</p>
