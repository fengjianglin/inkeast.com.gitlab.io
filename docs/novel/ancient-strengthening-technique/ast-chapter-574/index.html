 <p><strong>AST 574 - Demon Refining, Buddhist True Imprint, Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl</strong></p>
 <p>AST 574 - Demon Refining, Buddhist True Imprint, Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl</p>
 <p>A victor was about to emerge from the two strongest demonic beasts of the Stellar Horse Lake!</p>
 <p>Even if the Stellar Horse Nightmare Beast died, it would not let the Scarlet Gigantic Python off easily, it was a pity that the weak points of the Scarlet Gigantic Python were being defended heavily. The Stellar Horse Nightmare Beast was unable to reach them, and that huge mouth and sharp teeth could not be put to use.</p>
 <p>Sisi!</p>
 <p>There was a resounding sound of braying, and the Stellar Horse Nightmare Beast’s entire fiery jade body suddenly blazed with black flames.</p>
 <p>It was the Nether Combustion of the Stellar Horse Nightmare Beast! It burned its own life force to activate a strength beyond its limits!</p>
 <p>Sisi!</p>
 <p>The Scarlet Gigantic Python glowed red and continuously made ‘sisi’ sounds!</p>
 <p>“If I don’t go now, then when would I wait until!” Qing Shui rode on the Fire Bird and rushed out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he wanted to escape far away. However, at this moment, the Stellar Horse Nightmare Beast, which was burning in black flames, created an opening, it widened its big mouth and bit the body of the Scarlet Gigantic Python.</p>
 <p>The position was a little too high, it was very close to the position of the Scarlet Gigantic Python Demonic Beast’s Core. Either it sensed that it was in danger or because of the pain, the Scalet Gigantic Python loosened its body.</p>
 <p>The Stellar Horse Nightmare Beast took this opportunity to try and struggle free, but the Scarlet Gigantic Python would not let it escape. At this moment, the Fire Bird rushed out and for some unknown reason, the tangled Martial Saint beasts rushed at the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>“Oh no!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s back was instantly drenched in sweat, it was too late to return to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used this tyrannical air to lock down the two Demonic Beasts, whose strength had decreased severely. At the same time, he stuck a stack of Heavenly Talismans on them.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the huge Primordial Demon Refining Furnace appeared in front of him!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had practiced his control of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal till he was incomparably skilled. Because this had happened so suddenly, Qing Shui was afraid that the two strong Demonic Beast would spit poison at him, thus he wanted to use the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace to block them.</p>
 <p>After all, the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace was a Divine Artifact, it would be able to block their poison for a while!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did consider trying to refine them, as the two Demonic Beasts were tangled together and heavily injured. This was a hard to come by opportunity, especially since they had caught his fancy.</p>
 <p>Sisi!</p>
 <p>Sisi!</p>
 <p>These sharp cries were extremely weird, it seemed as though the two huge Demonic Beast were especially afraid of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace flashed in multiple colors and accurately captured the two Demonic Beasts.</p>
 <p>If they were not tangled together, Qing Shui felt that it would be impossible to get them into the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, this had saved him quite a lot of trouble.</p>
 <p>A short moment after they were captured, the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace released an even more intense light. At the same time, Qing Shui found that his brain was swelling, its connection to the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace seemed to be getting stronger.</p>
 <p>“Oh no! Why is it starting to refine them now……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui cried out in his heart, he circulated his vigor to the max, at the same time, the Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness seemed to rotate faster.</p>
 <p>“Return!”</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace containing the two huge Demonic Beast flew in front of Qing Shui. He stretched his hands out and touched the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace and slowly sent his Qi Force into it.</p>
 <p>Weng……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as though there were many bees buzzing around in his brain! He ferociously bit down on his tongue to clear his thoughts, Qing Shui felt pain beyond compare.</p>
 <p>It was already too late to stop the refining process, but he did not have any confidence as all. However, since he had no other options, Qing Shui could only grit his teeth and try his best.</p>
 <p>If he could succeed, not only he would live, but he might even get some huge benefits. However, if he failed, he might even lose his life!</p>
 <p>Mental State akin to that of immovable mountains!</p>
 <p>Now, the Tiger Form was extremely important, along with the Mental State akin to that of immovable mountains resulted in a multiplicative effect! The increase in vigor would cause his spirit energy to increase, his strength would be increased by 20 percent, that was one fold more than previously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gritted his teeth, had no other choice but to refine the two Martial Saint level Demonic Beast. At this moment, he did not hold anything back and give it all he got.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace began to gently vibrate, giving of a lot of hissing sounds, this caused Qing Shui to be very nervous.</p>
 <p>Weng Weng……</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace’s vibrations became even stronger and strands of fresh blood were vomited out by Qing Shui. This blood coincidentally landed on top of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, but it quickly disappeared.</p>
 <p>This caused the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace to quiet down, most importantly, Qing Shui felt his connection to the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace deepen by several folds.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could even clearly feel the scenario inside the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, however, that after feeling it, his scalp went numb.</p>
 <p>The two tangled Martial Saint beast did not appear to be refined, in fact, it even seemed that they slowly recovered from some of their injuries. At the same time, they were desperately resisting the rainbowed radiance of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui managed to kill a Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast previously, Qing Shui knew that he was at his peak state then. With all his abilities and even under the State of One with Elephant, only then could he resist it. If we were to talk about his raw strength, at his peak, he would have about the strength of 60 countries, and this was only if he held the Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not hesitate to eat an Agility-Enhancing Fruit, Vermillion Fruit…… Anything that could help him increase his abilities, he ate it. Now, he could not be bothered about being thrifty, he had to survive this first. Now that the situation had developed this way, he could only do his best and leave the rest up to fate.</p>
 <p>The only thing he could do was to frantically circulate his vigor to its peak state and to use a determined will to withstand it. Originally, the Great Revitalizing Pellet was pretty good, but only under an extreme circumstance then only he would use it. The effects would only last for an hour. After an hour, he would be weakened to the point where he was like a mortal, by then, he could only wait for death.</p>
 <p>However, the miserable cries coming from the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace gave Qing Shui a thread of hope!</p>
 <p>Time slowly went by, Qing Shui had never felt that the passage of time was so hard to bear, not even when he cultivated ‘Rebirth’ and walked on Blades and Swords. He had never felt such suffering.</p>
 <p>The blood dripping from the corner of his mouth caused the front of his gown to be wet, some of the blood was from when Qing Shui bit his lips. Qing Shui, who had once cultivated ‘Rebirth,’ had extraordinary willpower, and also a strong spirit. Especially under such circumstance, Qing Shui could draw out his innermost powers.</p>
 <p>Another two hours went by, Qing Shui’s face was pale and his sweat fell like rain. There were many wounds on his lips. The mark on his forehead turned strangely red, it was uncertain whether did it absorbed the blood or was it bleeding.</p>
 <p>The first time he refined demons, he ended up refining two Martial Saint level Demonic Beast, furthermore, he was only a peak Martial King. Qing Shui knew that this Divine Artifact level Primordial Demon Refining Furnace had its own strength, or else it would not be able to sustain for so long.</p>
 <p>Weng weng……</p>
 <p>The rainbowed colored light in the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace rotated and frantically shook. Qing Shui’s Spiritual Sense could tell that he was only halfway, he had already reached an impossible situation.</p>
 <p>Gritting his teeth, he quickly ate a Great Revitalizing Pellet. Qing Shui placed all his hopes on this Great Revitalizing Pellet, when he ate it, he could feel an explosive strength fill his body.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not care about anything else now, as long as it could raise his strength, he used it. He expanded his Spiritual Sense and frantically circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to catalyze the process in the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace.</p>
 <p>Fifteen minutes later, the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace started to frantically shake again. Qing Shui ferociously opened his reddened eyes, he knew this was the most critical moment, success or failure depended on this. If he could withstand it for a few more breaths of time, he could be considered to have succeeded.</p>
 <p>But it was difficult for Qing Shui to withstand this final resistance, he could only depend on fate now. His feets stood firmly on the stone ground, his whole body covered in blood. It was though he had taken a blood shower.</p>
 <p>Dong Dong……</p>
 <p>A trampling sound came from the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, following that, it started to rotate. Qing Shui’s hands were repelled, but his consciousness was still connected to it. Qing Shui only felt as if his his brain had just exploded, it was incomparable painful, his whole body trembled, but he stubbornly maintained that connection without relaxing.</p>
 <p>Despite this, Qing Shui knew that his strength had waned, he gently closed his eyes, as though submitting to fate, and finally that final connection broke.</p>
 <p>“$&amp;!/=^$#@*#@ ……” (incomprehensible Buddhist Chant)</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui’s heart quietened down, a Buddhist chant suddenly appeared. Boundless strength arose from his body and Qing Shui was surrounded by a bright golden light. Qing Shui suddenly opened both his eyes and saw a huge Buddha Image.</p>
 <p>Looking back, there was a Golden Buddha Image towering over him, it seemed a little illusionary. Qing Shui had a smile on his face, in a short moment, he suddenly seemed to have no desires.</p>
 <p>His hands slowly stretched out and slowly turned a light gold!</p>
 <p>Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui struck palm imprints at the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace one after another, as each golden palm imprint hit the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, they seemed profound and spectacular. His plain but strong palm imprint emitted a strange strength.</p>
 <p>After 399 palm imprints, he fainted, but his eyes were closed in satisfaction.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>“Elder Sister, it has been five months, the baby will be born in another 5 months. When he comes back and a child calls him father, what do you think his expression will be?” Huoyun Liu-Li faced Canghai Mingyue and laughed loudly, she seemed to be full of anticipation as she tried to imagine Qing Shui’s expression.</p>
 <p>“It is not as though no one calls him father, look at those two young lasses, aren’t they like little angels.” Canghai Mingyue laughed loudly and said, she seemed incomparable happy as she used a hand to rub the slight bump on her abdomen.</p>
 <p>Although she was already five months pregnant, she was still very beautiful, her face had a faint expression of satisfaction, or maybe it was hope.</p>
 <p>“That is different, this is the child of elder sister and him. Hm, Elder sister, would your prefer it to be a boy or a girl?” When Huoyun Liu-Li said this, she seemed especially happy.</p>
 <p>“They are both the same, I like both.” Canghai Mingyue smiled and looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>“I like girls, boys are too naughty, however, if it is a boy like Qing Shui, it would not be too bad.” Huoyun Liu-Li squinted her eyes as she happily said.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, come, let’s go back, or the clan will send someone to search for us.”</p>
 <p>“Hm, stupid Qing Shui, dumb Qing Shui, quickly come back……” Huoyun Liu-Li mumbled as they headed back to the Qing Clan…...</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui woke up, he discovered that the sun was rising, he did not know if he had only slept for a day or multiple days, however, he was very happy.</p>
 <p>He had once again escaped from the clutches of death, Qing Shui felt that the heavens had been quite generous to him, he should not be complaining about anything!</p>
 <p>When he stood up from the ground, saw the Fire Bird guarding him closeby. Qing Shui felt a warm feeling fill his heart. He moved his four limbs and did not discover anything wrong, in fact he even felt that his strength had been consolidated.</p>
 <p>Taichi Fist!</p>
 <p>The sun had just risen, but the time was not completely over yet. Thus, Qing Shui practiced a round of Taichi Fist, every strike was repeated tens of times.</p>
 <p>After stopping, Qing Shui suddenly thought about the final Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, it seemed different from usual, as if he had reached the stage of the ‘Buddhist True Imprint’.</p>
 <p>Unintentional growth, if the people of the Buddhist sects saw this, they would say that Qing Shui had a great affinity with Buddha. Qing Shui stretched out his hands, ‘River breaking the shackles’!</p>
 <p>Both his hands turned into a light gold and countless huge illusory shadows as though it was ground down, pressing downwards so heavily that it made people not dare to defend.</p>
 <p>It did not seem fast but it could not be defended against!</p>
 <p>Following that, he struck out many and complicated palm imprints. However, despite having an indescribable force hidden within it, these palm imprints’ might was not greater than the Tiger Form. This caused Qing Shui to feel incredulous.</p>
 <p>Since it was a good thing, despite not understanding it, he did not think about it further. In the distance, Qing Shui noticed the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, it had already shrunken down to about a meter. Qing Shui knew that the refining had failed, but he had managed to keep his life and improve the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, so it was worth it.</p>
 <p>“Rise!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace to fly in front of him, then he casually tossed it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Then he looked into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he wanted to see if the two Martial Saint Demonic Beast left behind anything.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned when he looked inside!</p>
 <p>Within the bright and clean Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, there was a pearl the size of a fist. Half of the pearl was red and the other half black, the Spiritual Energy fluctuations it emitted caused Qing Shui to be speechless.</p>
 <p>“Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl?” Qing Shui stared blankly at that pearl that was emitting a strange light.</p>
 <p>He originally thought that when it failed, there would be nothing left, yet it actually managed to refine such a thing. This thing was for Demonic Beasts to use, naturally, its effect was to raise their strength.</p>
 <p>Looking at the boundless wilderness, danger can appear at any time. Qing Shui looked at the pearl in his hands, then summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, whether it could make a breakthrough this time would depend on its fortunes.</p>
 <p>Seeing the pearl, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant continuously circled Qing Shui, as though it was very interested in the pearl. Qing Shui hesitated, should he give it to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant or the Fire Bird?</p>
 <p>Finally, he thought about how half the pearl was made from the essences of the Stellar Horse Nightmare Beast and the other half from the essence of the Scarlet Gigantic Python. Considering that the Fire Bird was a flying beast, he felt that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would be more suitable.</p>
 <p>“Do your best!” Qing Shui smiled as he threw the pearl to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui had another reason, if the Diamond Gigantic Elephant grew stronger, the Qing Shui would obtain 20 percent of whatever it gained. Who knew, maybe under such circumstances, Qing Shui might be able to break through to Martial Saint Realm or breakthrough to the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique…...</p>
 <p>As the Diamond Gigantic Elephant swallow that pearl, Qing Shui found himself to be very excited, if the Diamond Gigantic Elephant made a breakthrough, it would become a Martial Saint level Demonic Beast…...</p>
 <p>If he had a Martial Saint level Demonic Beast, in addition to his own strength, it would be possible for him to deal with a grade one Martial Saint, or maybe even a Grade Two Martial Saint.</p>
