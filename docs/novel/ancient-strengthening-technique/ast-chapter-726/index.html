 <p><strong>AST 726 - One month of time, Jiange’s good looks</strong></p>
 <p>After Luan Luan left, the two of them seemed to sigh in relief before slowly letting go of each other’s hands.</p>
 <p>“Master……”</p>
 <p>“Why Are you calling me master?” Yiye Jiange knitted her eyebrows, she seemed faintly disappointed in Qing Shui, if Qing Shui did not look carefully, he would not be able to tell.</p>
 <p>“Jiange!” Qing Shui called out, he did not know how he felt in his heart. The relationship he had with Yiye Jiange was a result of Luan Luan or at least that was what Qing Shui felt.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was one of the people that rescued Qing Shui from a sticky situation in the early days, Qing Shui willingly called her master, in Qing Shui’s eyes, she was an otherworldly goddess.</p>
 <p>“Alright, today is a happy day, let’s only talk about happy things.” Yiye Jiange smiled and said in a relaxed manner, she felt that she was too obvious earlier.</p>
 <p>“Mn, are you used to this place?”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange is a woman who liked quiet or else, she would not choose to come here. Even when she was in the Skysword Sect, she also stayed alone on a mountain peak.</p>
 <p>“I’m used to it already, I am happy here.” Yiye Jiange gestured Qing Shui to take a seat, the two of them did not sit across each other but they sat side by side on the couch.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out two porcelain bottles, they contained the Yang Pellet, he had obtained the recipe from Yuan Su and refined it. Its effects extended lifespan by 50 years, a person can only take one pill in their entire life.</p>
 <p>“This is the Yang Pellet, it can extend lifespan by 50 years, it’s a pity that only one pill can be taken, this is for you and Luan Luan.” Qing Shui handed to bottles over to Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>As it is, Luan Luan already had a lifespan of a hundred years, now, she had another fifty years. The lifespan of the young lass were all given by Qing Shui. Yiye Jiange did not receive it, instead, she smiled and said: “Give it to her yourself, she is very smart.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s return to the Qing Clan, it is very lively there, you need to get used to coming in contact other people.” Qing Shui smiled as he looked at Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“Mn, that’s fine too, actually Luan Luan frequently goes to the Qing Clan.” Yiye Jian Ge smiled.</p>
 <p>“She does? It is fine to lie to her for her whole life but what about you? What if you want to marry someone in future? What are you going to say to Luan Luan?” Qing Shui said after she thought for a while, without realizing it, he mentioned this problem.</p>
 <p>“Who’s going to marry? I’m not marrying.” Yiye Jiange panted in rage and glared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, you’re not marrying. Jiange, let me ask you a question.” Qing Shui hurriedly said. With such a beautiful master like her having become his wife in name he felt quite bewildered.</p>
 <p>“Ask away.” Yiye Jiange thought about her earlier raging expression and laughed, that was why she was very relaxed now.</p>
 <p>“Um, Jiange, have you ever liked any man? Have you ever thought of marrying or spending the rest of your life with a man?” Qing Shui tried to explain himself but he did not know if he explained himself clearly. Actually, Qing Shui wanted to ask her if she was just cold or did she not like men……</p>
 <p>“You smelly brat, are you asking for a beating? Although I have not liked any man,I am very normal, I am a normal girl.” Yiye Jiange blushed as she smacked Qing Shui on the head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very happy, he did not know he was very happy when he was spending time with Yiye Jiange. When an otherworldly goddess like her revealed this kind of expression, it made Qing Shui’s thoughts very clear, it was worth it to get smacked by Yiye Jiange just to see her angry expression, it felt like he was cleansed, as though he was completely cleaned out.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so Yiye Jiange had never liked him, that’s good……” Qing Shui seemed to have heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“You smelly brat, you can’t wait for me to get married?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui in rage.</p>
 <p>“You are the mother of my daughter, of course, I am not willing.” Qing Shui made fun of her, in the past, it was impossible for Qing Shui to say all these naturally.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange just glared at Qing Shui in rage and embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped speaking anymore, Qing Shui felt that Yiye Jiange could really be selfless, in addition to her otherworldly atmosphere, it was like a goddess descending to the mortal world.</p>
 <p>Ever since Luan Luan called him daddy and Yiye Jiange mother, the feelings between the two of them had some changes, it was not that of family but one that surpassed that.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went to meet Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji, when they saw Qing Shui, they were incredibly happy. The two of them had done their best for the Heavenly Palace but they were limited to the Starmoon Hall.</p>
 <p>It was a good thing that the Heavenly Palace had Elder Ge to manage it, no one dares to rashly talk about that demon like youth behind his back, the youngest patriarch of the Heavenly Palace, Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui invited Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji to the Qing Clan, they said that they would go in two days.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan how is that Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear of yours”” Qing Shui thought of that Demonic Beast that he gave her years ago. It was considered a Mutated Beast of Heaven and Earth, he did not know how it was now.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, take a look!”</p>
 <p>Luan Luan said happily then waved her right hand.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A huge mutated bear that was about ten meters tall that was covered in flame scale armor appeared. Although it looked very similar to what it did in the past, it was larger by threefold, it now looked more like a giant clad in a flaming armor.</p>
 <p>Early Martial Saint!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that it roughly had the abilities of a Grade 1 Martial Saint. The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear had not matured yet, of course Qing Shui’s Medicinal Pills helped. Now, Qing Shui was looking forward to its abilities when it matured.</p>
 <p>The strength of 100 countries and the defense of 650 countries!</p>
 <p>This was the current abilities of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear!</p>
 <p>The strongest aspects of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear was its defense and its flame attack but its physical attacks were the weakest. Although it was only it only had the abilities of a Grade 1 Martial Saint, with its battle capabilities, a peak Grade 2 Martial Saint Demonic Beast was not its opponent.</p>
 <p>“The Demonic Beast that daddy gave me was the best, my other Demonic Beasts were only peak Martial Kings. I have not had an opportunity to tame other Demon Beasts yet, when will daddy bring me to tame Demonic Beasts?” Luan Luan pulled on Qing Shui’s arm as she</p>
 <p>“Next time, there will be time. When your mother comes out, let’s go back.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>The three of them rode on the Fire Bird and headed for the Qing Clan just past noon. Qing Shui felt like laughing when he looked at Luan Luan, his daughter was already so big but she still called him daddy like she did when she was young, it had been thirteen or fourteen years already.</p>
 <p>Maybe she sensed Qing Shui’s thoughts, Yiye Jiange smiled gently at Qing Shui, there was something in that smile that made Qing Shui feel that it would be worth it no matter how tough it was.</p>
 <p>It was mid-afternoon when they arrived at the Qing Clan, Luan Luan was slightly older than Yuchang but Yuchang was also about to undergo her coming-of-age ceremony, after the newyears, she would be an adult.</p>
 <p>Yuchang had inherited the good points of Mingyue Gelou, together with Luan Luan, they were both perfect beauties, just that they were young and inexperienced, especially Yuchang.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui believed that there would be many people proposing marriage in the future but then he remember that Qing Bei had not married yet, there was also his sister Qing Qing. The two brats would probably not marry too early, even though they could marry after the age of 16 in the World of the Nine Continents. Cultivators had a longer lifespan and adolescence phase, their complexions could be maintained for hundreds of years. Thus, once they became Xiantian, they did not have to be in a hurry to marry, unless they met someone suitable.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, one month flashed by!</p>
 <p>In this one month, Qing Shui’s days were incomparably free of anxiety. He spent his days cultivating, guiding the Qing Clan members’ cultivation and playing with Qing Zun and Qing Yin.</p>
 <p>He had a great night life in the room for the few girls, of course, it was just limited to Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou, and Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I want children too!” Huoyun Liu-li leaned on Qing Shui’s body and batted her eyelashes.</p>
 <p>“Then give birth!”</p>
 <p>“Give me……”</p>
 <p>In the World of the Nine Continents, the stronger your abilities, the lower your reproductive abilities, this seemed like nature's way of balancing things. The stronger their abilities and talents, the better the genes that would be passed down, this will eventually lead to the laws of nature being broken. Thus, the stronger their abilities, the better their talents, the lower the chances are of getting pregnant, even to the point of being infertile.</p>
 <p>When he was with the few girls, Qing Shui did not specially adopt any special measures but only Canghai Mingyue had gotten pregnant, with a pair of twins.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui guessed that it also had something to do with the number of times he been with them. He had only been with Huoyun Liu-Li a few time, Shi Qingzhuang even lesser, although he had been with Mingyue Gelou more, she was not pregnant either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also wanted a few more children, after all, the stronger he became, the lesser the chance of pregnancy. He might regret it if he could not get his women pregnant now.</p>
 <p>But these kind of things cannot be rushed, plus those saying a stronger person had fewer chances of being pregnant might not be right. After all, Qing Shui still had other ways to get his woman pregnant, just that he preferred for them to get pregnant naturally. He basically was in one of their rooms every night now, those women seem to be less reserved but he spent the most time with Huoyun Liu-Li and the least with Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was happy that Wenren Wu-shuang recovered her memories, he was originally worried that she would feel hurt over the matter with her sister. After experiencing that, she came to accept all of this and understood a lot more.</p>
 <p>Although she seemed very close to Qing Shui, she maintained a certain distance. She never mentioned the words that they had spoken before. When Qing Shui mentioned it to Wenren Wu-shuang, she kept saying that she would give him a chance if he defeated her. Thus, even though they seemed close he was not able to verify their exact relationship.</p>
 <p>Back then, Qing Shui was alone but now he had several women, thus Qing Shui hesitated. Because Wenren Wu-shuang was reserved, she did not think about this problem.</p>
 <p>Only when Qing Shui thought about how alone she was, he hesitated, although he did not break through that final barrier with her, they had some intimate contact, just that she stopped him at the last step.</p>
 <p>“Wu-shuang, do you remember what you said?” Qing Shui saw Wenren Wu-shuang staring blankly at the pond in the Qing Clan backyard.</p>
 <p>“What words?” Wenren Wu-shuang raised her head and smiled at Qing Shui, before gesturing for Qing Shui to sit across from her.</p>
 <p>They were at a gazebo that was beside the pond, there was a weeping willow beside the pond, it was blocking the sunlight, making this area very beautiful and quiet.</p>
 <p>“You said that when my abilities exceeded yours, then I can chase you, does it still count?” Qing Shui looked at Wenren Wu-shuang.</p>
 <p>“You already have a few women, are you still not satisfied?” Wenren Wu-shuang smiled gently at Qing Shui, her face looked very relaxed.</p>
