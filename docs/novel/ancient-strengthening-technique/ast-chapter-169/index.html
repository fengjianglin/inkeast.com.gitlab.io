 <p><strong>Chapter 169 The secret of 3rd Elder Zhu Qing.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 169 – The secret of 3rd Elder Zhu Qing</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui followed the voice and discovered an easily concealed cave. When Qing Shui walked near, he realised that the cave’s opening was wide enough for two people to enter together.</p>
  <p>The sounds of the voices were getting increasingly clear. They were filled with excitement and passion. </p>
  <p>The voice of the female contained a hint of magnetism as it was loud and filled with emotions. Qing Shui could hear rapid breathing and high pitched moans. It was extremely stimulating for Qing Shui and caused him to believe that her moans had the power to attract a truck full of men.</p>
  <p>“F*ck, there’s actually a bed here. It seems that it’s been placed here for a long time!”</p>
  <p>With a glimpse, he could see that there were two jade-white bodies intertwined together like snakes on the top of the bed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned as there were actually two elegant women on top of the bed. This was the first time that Qing Shui witnessed two women conducting acts of lesbianism.</p>
  <p>One woman climbed on top of the other, kissing and sucking on her bosoms. Qing Shui felt that the moans he heard earlier must’ve originated from the woman lying on her back and enjoying the service.</p>
  <p>From his angle, he could see the woman on top showing her fair and full perky butt. Even the wetness of her pleasure hole could be clearly seen by Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui covertly glanced at the hourglass figure of the woman lying beneath. Her white, jade-like legs were capable of making Qing Shui’s blood surge. After all, it had been a long period of time since he last did the deed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was observing the woman below as she saw that her eyes were closed and her mouth was slightly parted. Even with her concealed features, the soul-stirring voice of her moans relentlessly sounded out. With just a single glance, Qing Shui already recognised that this charming woman was none other than his 3rd Elder – Zhu Qing.</p>
  <p>“Master, the lass named Wu-shuang is truly beautiful. Has master thought of doing it with her before…?” The lanky woman lying on top inclined her head as she lightly spoke.</p>
  <p>“Wu-shuang. Her heart is already with that little brat. It’s useless. Your master has already tried liking guys before, but I just couldn’t hold the interest.” Zhu Qing sighed.</p>
  <p>“Yan`er is like this as well!”</p>
  <p>After he heard this, Qing Shui hurriedly retreated. Given that the 2nd eldest Gongsun Sanqian was already 80+, this 3rd Martial Aunt wouldn’t be considered young either. Qing Shui didn’t want to have anything to do with this ‘old woman’. Things would be extremely awkward if he was discovered.</p>
  <p>However, Qing Shui didn’t expect that she was actually into females. It seemed like he had to warn Wu-shuang. He recalled the earlier instance when Zhu Qing was passionately pulling Wu-shuang along. Was she intentionally taking advantage of her?</p>
  <p>Depleted of his will to strolled about, Qing Shui returned to the grand hall as he discovered Yiye Jiange over there. The instant he laid his eyes on Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui felt very weird. It was as though he was looking at a wife who was waiting for her husband to be back.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui shook his head, and cleared these distracting thoughts. He told Yiye Jiange about the things he had witnessed earlier concerning Zhu Qing.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you are so talented. You were able to establish your might the moment you arrived here. Not only did you injure a Xiantian protector, but you also even knocked a substitute Elder unconscious. Do you think Master should praise you?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at his beautiful teacher who was trying to suppress her laughter as he bitterly smiled. “I was just afraid of future troubles. Isn’t it quieter this way?”</p>
  <p>“Your other Martial Uncles all came to tell me that you caused them to lose their faces. However, I like the fact that you beat them all up. I would rather have pacified them after they got injured than you being beaten up. They were also coming to pacify me as well.”</p>
  <p>Her gentle tone caused Qing Shui to feel warmth in his heart. In truth, Qing Shui had never thought of Yiye Jiange as his master. Master was the honorary term used to address a teacher who imparted her skills. Therefore, the one who imparted their skills and knowledge was once and forever regarded as and respected as a master. After all, in chinese customs, a teacher for a day equated to a father-figure for life.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s feelings for Yiye had not reached to such extents. It was just another form of addressing her. However, Yiye Jiange’s and Baili Jingwei’s gratitude was something that could never be fully repaid during Qing Shui’s current lifetime. This was the reason why Qing Shui respected Yiye as his teacher, and that he would never go too far with his teasing and jokes with her. Not only that, but he even forced himself to not have lewd thoughts about his goddess teacher.</p>
  <p>“Master, I need to discuss something with you.” Qing Shui pondered a little as he spoke.</p>
  <p>“Just say it directly. Why are you being so polite? As long as your request doesn’t exceed the boundaries of my power, I will grant it.”</p>
  <p>“I wish to go down the mountain, and will stay within Canglang Country. Staying in the mountains doesn’t suit my method of cultivation. I’m wondering if you could grant me my request?” Qing Shui gave a rather absurd reason.</p>
  <p>Yihe Jiange was stunned for a moment before lightly nodding her head, “You can, but you have to come back up the mountain at least once a month.”</p>
  <p>“No problem. Then, can I leave today…?”</p>
  <p>“Nope! Remember that today, you have to…cook for me!” Yiye Jiange somewhat embarrassedly replied Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui heard the word ‘nope’, his heart almost leapt out. After he heard the whole sentence, he could only bitterly smile as he nodded, “Do you wish to replicate the taste of the meal that I cooked?”</p>
  <p>Yiye realised that Qing Shui didn’t seem to be joking before she replied, “Of course, who wouldn’t want to? Doesn’t it require a lot of time? I’m afraid that even if I spent my whole life doing it, I wouldn’t be able to replicate that taste.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui agreed with Yiye’s words. After all, even 100 years of research might not be enough to replicate the exact same taste.<br></p>
  <p>“I have a method that will allow you to mimic the taste of my dish. Let’s go and return back to the misty peak!” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Standing on the back of that snowy crane, Qing Shui was thinking about the fact that he could witness the sight of Yiye Jiange making dinner. In fact, he looked extremely forward to it. He imagined a goddess holding a ladle with a wok in her hands…</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui finally saw the image, he felt stunned by her beauty. She looked pure and elegant. She had an indescribable warmth and an ability to cause others to be infatuated with her.</p>
  <p>She looked like a celestial being that had descended from the heavens. If only he could interact with her, and live together. Even if they could only spend a single day together, it would be unforgettable. Being able to eat the dishes she cooked also brought a strange sense of unknown satisfaction.</p>
  <p>He must work hard to cultivate this “Godly Beauty Flower” to its final form. He couldn’t allow others to destroy her.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui left behind 100 Drunken Fragrance Fruit for Yiye Jiange. Yiye felt somewhat incredulous when she discovered that the food’s exquisite taste originated from this little fruit. After she tried eating the dishes she made herself, she was even happier than the time she broke through to Xiantian! The radiance of her beauty when she saw Qing Shui leaving 100 fruits with her was so beautiful that it would cause everyone to be mesmerised.</p>
  <p>Once again, he felt the truth of the adage -“Food and Sex were the greatest!”</p>
  <p>The next day, he intentionally went to look for Wenren Wu-shuang and warn her of the matters regarding Zhu Qing. Wu-shuang’s bashful face began to fill with a hidden bitterness as she glanced at Qing Shui. However, she believed him as Qing Shui had never lied to her before, especially with this type of matter.</p>
  <p>“I’m just telling you right now, in case you fall for her trap… Don’t let that old woman hook you away. Remember to tell yourself that you will only be happy when you are doing with a man. Hehe…” Qing Shui snickered.</p>
  <p>“Are you asking for a beating?!” Wu-shuang shyly rapped Qing Shui on his shoulders.</p>
  <p>“Remember what I’ve said. I’m going down the mountain today. I will come back only once a month, and stay for about two days during each visit!” It was already late in the morning, and the ordinary disciples of the Skysword Sect had begun their basic training. For Protectors and higher, they would cultivate at their own pace, inside their private rooms or training chambers.</p>
  <p>“You have to take good care of yourself when you are outside. Also, be cautious in everything you do.” Wenren Wu-shuang lowered her head as she lightly said.</p>
  <p>A trace of worry could be seen on her face. Qing Shui extended his hands and gently hugged her, “Relax, I haven’t made you my woman yet. How could something happen to me?”</p>
  <p>Under Wenren Wu-shuang’s pouting, Qing Shui departed the mountain!</p>
  <p>After arriving in Cang Lang Country, Qing Shui decided that if he didn’t go exploring the streets of this prosperous country, wouldn’t it be equivalent of letting himself down? This was why Qing Shui chose to depart the mountain. With his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui wasn’t worried about lost time.</p>
  <p>The first place Qing Shui decided to go to was a place Hundred Miles City didn’t have, an auction house!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui still had quite a lot of money with him. Thus, he wanted to buy something that could be useful to him. He didn’t have to worry about storage as he already had a spatial realm ready to store the loot he prepared to buy from the auctions!</p>

 <p>When Qing Shui finally saw the image, he felt stunned by her beauty. She looked pure and elegant. She had an indescribable warmth and an ability to cause others to be infatuated with her.</p>
 <p>She looked like a celestial being that had descended from the heavens. If only he could interact with her, and live together. Even if they could only spend a single day together, it would be unforgettable. Being able to eat the dishes she cooked also brought a strange sense of unknown satisfaction.</p>
 <p>He must work hard to cultivate this “Godly Beauty Flower” to its final form. He couldn’t allow others to destroy her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left behind 100 Drunken Fragrance Fruit for Yiye Jiange. Yiye felt somewhat incredulous when she discovered that the food’s exquisite taste originated from this little fruit. After she tried eating the dishes she made herself, she was even happier than the time she broke through to Xiantian! The radiance of her beauty when she saw Qing Shui leaving 100 fruits with her was so beautiful that it would cause everyone to be mesmerised.</p>
 <p>Once again, he felt the truth of the adage -“Food and Sex were the greatest!”</p>
 <p>The next day, he intentionally went to look for Wenren Wu-shuang and warn her of the matters regarding Zhu Qing. Wu-shuang’s bashful face began to fill with a hidden bitterness as she glanced at Qing Shui. However, she believed him as Qing Shui had never lied to her before, especially with this type of matter.</p>
 <p>“I’m just telling you right now, in case you fall for her trap… Don’t let that old woman hook you away. Remember to tell yourself that you will only be happy when you are doing with a man. Hehe…” Qing Shui snickered.</p>
 <p>“Are you asking for a beating?!” Wu-shuang shyly rapped Qing Shui on his shoulders.</p>
 <p>“Remember what I’ve said. I’m going down the mountain today. I will come back only once a month, and stay for about two days during each visit!” It was already late in the morning, and the ordinary disciples of the Skysword Sect had begun their basic training. For Protectors and higher, they would cultivate at their own pace, inside their private rooms or training chambers.</p>
 <p>“You have to take good care of yourself when you are outside. Also, be cautious in everything you do.” Wenren Wu-shuang lowered her head as she lightly said.</p>
 <p>A trace of worry could be seen on her face. Qing Shui extended his hands and gently hugged her, “Relax, I haven’t made you my woman yet. How could something happen to me?”</p>
 <p>Under Wenren Wu-shuang’s pouting, Qing Shui departed the mountain!</p>
 <p>After arriving in Cang Lang Country, Qing Shui decided that if he didn’t go exploring the streets of this prosperous country, wouldn’t it be equivalent of letting himself down? This was why Qing Shui chose to depart the mountain. With his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui wasn’t worried about lost time.</p>
 <p>The first place Qing Shui decided to go to was a place Hundred Miles City didn’t have, an auction house!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still had quite a lot of money with him. Thus, he wanted to buy something that could be useful to him. He didn’t have to worry about storage as he already had a spatial realm ready to store the loot he prepared to buy from the auctions!</p>
