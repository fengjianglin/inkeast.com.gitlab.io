 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2346 - Fifth Young Master, Disposed Of</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was amused, listening to the Fifth Young Master. Being envious and jealous? He really wasn’t. He wondered what it was about the Fifth Young Master that he would be envious of. Plus, he was not someone who would simply get envious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you have nothing else then you’d better withdraw. I'm just passing by this place. I don't want to get upset with anybody,” Qing Shui shook his head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think you can leave so easily after messing with our Fifth Young Master, huh? Hand over the items you've got today and we can consider letting you go,” A small man beside the Fifth Young Master said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui did not say anything but simply stared at the Fifth Young Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop looking. Our Fifth Young Master does not want to kill anybody so it's your advantage to just give us the items. You won't get such a luxury anymore if you make a noise,” The previous man said again, sounding extremely arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really don't know how you have managed to survive till now. Fifth Young Master, yes? Since you don't want to manage your dog, let me help you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui raised his hand as soon as he finished talking. He slapped and threw the person away. The man was flung several tens meters away with his neck slanted. Qing Shui did not want him to die. If he wanted to, the man would have been dead even if he had ten lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, great. You dare to hit the men of the Dukes.” The Fifth Young Master said with an insincere smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really are pitiful, thinking that I'm afraid of killing you. I’ve said it before. The Dukes that you're so proud of are nothing to me. If I kill you, your family would have to apologize to me instead. If you don't believe me, I will gladly show you.” Qing Shui held out his hand and attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of The Fifth Young Master’s arm and leg broke instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go! Kill him!” The Fifth Young Master looked pale and shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, many people surrounded the place. There were a lot of men on the Fifth Young Master's side, many of them dashing to Qing Shui. Qing Shui killed a great half of them with no effort. The remaining ones stopped in their tracks, knowing that they had encountered someone difficult today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, the men of the Dukes came. The Fifth Young Master got his arm and leg broken by somebody in front of his territory. If this news spread out, the Dukes would lose their faces entirely. This time, the people who came were great warriors. Qing Shui watched the opponents with a smile, looking extremely calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you and why did you hurt the Duke's man?” A handsome man asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seventh Uncle, kill him! Kill him!” Lan Xi yelled out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui made another strike from afar and two loud snaps were heard again, “If you make another noise, I will break your d**k.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That statement was very powerful and silenced Lan Xi’s immediately. Broken limbs could be treated, but once a man’s treasure was broken, his whole life was considered finished. He dared not to take the risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man, whom Lan Xi called Seventh Uncle, was extremely enraged. His eyes were blazing with fire. How reckless was that? to break another arm and leg of his nephew directly in front of him. The man dared not act carelessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don't care who you are. Just take my advice. The Dukedom is nothing. You can take it as I'm boasting but you can have a try. As for the consequences, you will have to bear with them.” Qing Shui looked at the Fifth Young Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir, I wonder where you have come from. Can you show me something, or else I can't justify myself when I return.” The man frowned a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can try, but I can't guarantee your survival if you do.” Qing Shui looked at the man. He wanted to settle for both sides as there was nothing as good as that. It was impossible to not pay the price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man hesitated, but he still nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui said to the man, “Come on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was not too kind this time. He nodded and posed a starting gesture. Then, he took out a willow leaf-like knife. It was as translucent as jade. There were three haloes of different colors; azure, white, and green.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were the energies of wind, holiness and vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man’s aura changed. He became profound and deep. This change made Qing Shui's eyes brighten. This man had good strength and he seemed stronger than Chi Yang. Apparently, this man was great in the Dukedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder he was quite confident. He indeed had that qualification. However, he was still much weaker than Qing Shui, especially after Qing Shui got the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda of Violence and Endurance. He could simply fool the opponent without using The Divine Weapon Flying Sword and Stellar Transposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swipe swipe swipe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man waved his Saber once but he performed three Saber Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three Perfections Treasure Saber!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's eyes brightened, he did not expect the opponent to have an item like this. He held out his hand as the opponent was swinging his weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Qing Shui's current strength and sight, he grabbed onto the opponent’s wrist. Then, his hand advanced abruptly and tapped on the man's chest, making the man vomit fresh blood and back off. The man's saber was dropped during this and Qing Shui swiftly grabbed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was terrified to death. One move, and he received severe injuries. Perhaps, the opponent had already gone easy on him. His instinct said so, and his instinct was always right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fifth Young Master was extremely frightened when he saw the battle. Seventh Uncle was the cream of the crop in the Dukedom. He was among the top five or even top three. Yet, he could not even stand against a single move by the opponent. What was the background of this young man? Why would he even get in trouble with this man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui walked to the Fifth Young Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don't kill me! I'm wrong, I won't ever do that again. I'll give all these items to you!” While talking, the Fifth Young Master took out the items he got from the auction. Though his arms were broken, he could still get the items out of the Interspatial Silk Sachet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won't kill you. It would just soil my hands to kill someone like you. However, everyone has to be responsible for their actions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui pointed a finger at the Fifth Young Master who then gave a loud scream and looked as pale as ashes. He had lost all his cultivation. The Fifth Young Master was a genius. He was quite good at training even though he was no match for Qing Shui. But now, he was useless trash. In the future, he would not even stand a place in his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A big clan was merciless. Useless trash would not be tolerated. If he was born to be useless, it would be fine. However, he was once a genius. A reckless genius who tormented so many men. Now, he would be shamed for countless times in later days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting these aside, he could not face it himself. For a strong warrior, his cultivation was more vital than his own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Remember, if the Dukes come to me next time, I don't mind wiping all of you out and make the Lan Clan disappear.” Qing Shui said lightly. He kept the Divine Weapon Crystal and walked to the resthouse in front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dukes did not come again, but Qing Shui overheard something at the door at night. He stayed in a resthouse near the auction house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who's that?” Qing Shui asked quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It's me. Can I come in?” An alluring voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was perplexed as the voice sounded familiar. After a moment, he knew it was the mysterious female auctioneer at the auction house. He wondered why she came here at night. He definitely would not think that she was here to offer herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come in!” Qing Shui did not lock the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was wearing the same red gown. Her thin waist and thick bottom looked even more charming under the light. This woman was so enticing, but she had a fluctuating soul. She was not a virgin. Qing Shui could sense that she had intercourse with several men.</span></p>
