  <p><strong>AST 202 – Meeting the Female Owner of the Golden Thunder Winged Condor once again</strong></p>
  <p>Zhu Qing hesitated awhile before shyly flipping her body and climbing on top of Qing Shui. That full, white, perky butt was sticking up as she guided Qing Shui inside her.<br></p>
  <p>………….</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Leaving the recently matured Endurance Enhancing Fruits for Zhu Qing, he still passed a six other fruits to her. Qing Shui couldn’t help but laugh just thinking of the startled look in her eyes.</p>
  <p>Conveniently, he also headed over to Wu-shuang’s place and left her the Endurance Enhancing and Physique Enhancing Fruits before returning to Cloud Mist Peak. Before he left, he wanted to upgrade the strength of those he cared about. What a pity that there weren’t any Small Revitalizing Pellets left. If not, he would have given some to Zhu Qing.</p>
  <p>“Are you leaving tomorrow?” Yiye Jiange appeared to have something on her mind as she inquired.</p>
  <p>“Mhm, yup. I will give you something good later.” Qing Shui replied.</p>
  <p>“You should know what this is. This is for you and the little lass. As for the Bear Form and Crane Form, you should cultivate and then guide the little lass in it. Just ignore other cultivation arts for now. If there are cultivation arts at the legendary level, you can consider it. Oh ya, don’t tell the little lass that she’s learning the Bear Form. She hates bears.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui similarly passed on a few fruits and that beast skin paper over to Yiye. He took the chance to gaze at her. She was the epitome of beauty and pureness. Qing Shui didn’t want to blasphemise her image by fantasizing about her in his mind. It would feel as though he just sinned…</p>
  <p>“I will quietly leave here tomorrow, so don’t tell the little lass.” Qing Shui spoke as he departed.</p>
  <p>Yiye knew that Qing Shui wanted to leave alone, but she couldn’t help to strongly desire sending him off.</p>
  <p>Spending the night in cultivation, Qing Shui entered his spatial realm and meticulously studied the “Duo Cultivation Technique” once again. He thought of the joint union he had with Zhu Qing earlier that morning, especially the positions and that passionate, lust-filled face of Zhu Qing.</p>
  <p>The energy that was generated by the Duo Cultivation method was the purest. This caused Qing Shui to be exceptionally joyful. Especially for the first time the energy was generated, it was equivalent to the efforts of half a year of arduous cultivation. This was the benefits of Duo Cultivation which was also why the guys that cultivate this technique usually required a lot of different women.</p>
  <p>On the next day before dawn arrived, Qing Shui already mounted the phoenix and flew down the mountains. Qing Shui didn’t the notice the graceful figure in the shadows that was silently watching him fly away.</p>
  <p>After he left the mountains, Qing Shui commanded the fire bird to slow down its speed and to head in the direction of Earthly Paradise. Qing Shui intended to visit Huoyun Liu-Li since it had been almost eight months since he last saw her.</p>
  <p>It was late in the morning when Qing Shui finally reached Earthly Paradise. After dismounting, he walked towards Earthly Paradise.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect that the waitress would be the same one he met on his first day coming here. The waitress was surprised but happy when she saw Qing Shui, which caused Qing Shui to be slightly dumbfounded.</p>
  <p>“Mister, why are you here!? Boss said that if you were here, we are to bring you over to see her.” The waitress smiled.</p>
  <p>“What? So urgently?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he laughed along.</p>
  <p>“Boss said immediately.” The waitress laughed as she led Qing Shui up.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui once again entered the balcony that had the area of a spacious field. However, he was thunderstruck by what he saw. In the distance, there was a woman wielding the sword in a graceful dance. Her speed was akin to a flying bird. Her fluidity was like a flood dragon, resplendent and radiant while emitting a sense of vigor like a thousand-year tree. She was like the moon that was half-covered by clouds, and the snow that drifted about in the air.</p>
  <p>As Qing Shui saw the facial features of the woman, he was completely stunned. This woman was the same one who he had seen standing atop the Golden Winged Thunder Condor before!</p>
  <p>Her brows was in a beautiful arc, and her eyes shone like the Sirius star in the skies. Her iris had the hue of the purest black, and contained boundless depth. There was an innate disdain in the expression of her eyes, and that icy jade body gave people a sense of overwhelming beauty. Her body was long and svelte. Her shoulders were like the edge of a knife and she had the willowy waist of a water snake!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui dumbly stared at this woman who had a level of beauty similiar to his goddess master. Her beauty was like the bloom of flowers, causing intense desire to arise in those who looked at her. He felt an attraction towards her like a moth flying towards light.</p>
  <p>At the beginning, this woman didn’t notice Qing Shui, or more accurately, she unconsciously treated Qing Shui as a female waitress of Earthly Paradise. After she took a closer look and realised that this person was a man, the Qi of her body started to gushed out ferociously.</p>
  <p>Facing against that mighty aura, Qing Shui could still withstand it. Not only that, but he even silently dissolved the pressure of the aura which caused amazement to flash in the woman’s eyes.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui also didn’t expect that the woman was Canghai Mingyue, the master of Huoyun Liu-li. She was the sole cultivator who reached the peak of Xiantian in Canglang Country.</p>
  <p>Although his guess wasn’t verified yet, there shouldn’t be any mistakes.</p>
  <p>“Master, hmmm… Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p>Huoyun saw her master first before seeing Qing Shui as she called out joyfully.</p>
  <p>“Master, he is the Qing Shui that I often mentioned to you about.” Huoyun hugged Canghai Mingyue’s arm as she pouted adorably.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he smiled bitterly. Huoyun Liu-Li seemed as though she had transformed into a child when she was in front of her master.</p>
  <p>At this moment, Qing Shui had already arrived in front of the two of them.</p>
  <p>“This Junior had the opportunity of meeting with Senior before!” Qing Shui respectfully bowed, like a child in front of his elder. Although Huoyun’s master looked only to be in her thirties, no one knew how old she actually was.</p>
  <p>“We don’t have any relations between us. There’s no need for you to bow.”</p>
  <p>Her voice had a hint steel in it. After her initial glance at Qing Shui, she no longer looked at him.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, this is how my master usually acts. Don’t take it the wrong way.” Huoyun smiled, trying to diffuse the situation.</p>
  <p>“Woah, this little lass already started to protect her love interest.” Canghai Mingyue smiled as she glanced at her disciple with surprise. Although the tone of her voice was still the same, her looks caused one to be mesmerised to the point where they would be unable to extricate themselves.</p>
  <p>Upon looking at the sight of that smile on Canghai’s face, Qing Shui’s desire ignited. There was an indescribable charm and beauty in that smile of hers!</p>
  <p>“Master, don’t joke about me!” Huoyun appeared somewhat flustered.</p>
  <p>“I’m here today because I wanted to gift you something. I need to leave here and would only be back after a long time.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p>“Leaving here for a long time?” Huoyun bewilderedly asked.</p>
  <p>“Yeah, I want to go to the other places of the Greencloud Continent, such as the Continent’s Capital. But I will return to the Hundred Miles City after three years.” Qing Shui passed Huoyun some stuff as he spoke such as a few thousand Drunken Fragrance Fruit, and 90 pieces of Perilla and Thyme leaves.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui said he wanted to visit the Capital of Greencloud Continent, a bright light flickered in Canghai Mingyue’s eyes,</p>
  <p>“Aww, I don’t care! You have to accompany me for two days later. Your room is still empty and always ready for you.” The husky voice of Huoyun Liu-Li was so sexy as though it was hinting at a hidden meaning. Canghai Mingyue was also somewhat taken aback by shock.</p>
  <p>“Master, it’s not what you are thinking.” Huoyun rolled her eyes when she noticed the look of Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“Actually, why don’t you accompany him for leisure and travel about for three years?” Canghai Mingyue smiled as she extended her snow-white dainty hands as she lightly pinched Huoyun Liu-cheeks.</p>
  <p>“I still have to manage the Earthly Paradise that you left me.” Huoyun depressedly replied.</p>
  <p>“Mere worldly possessions, just abandon it or does the little lass love making money too much?” Canghai laughed.</p>
  <p>The words of Canghai Mingyue caused Qing Shui to understand some of her personality. She had an impressive atmosphere about her. She was decisive, and resolute in her decisions, not beating around the bush. It was also because of such an attribute to her personality that further accentuated her charm.</p>
  <p>“This business is the lifeblood of Master, a mission that you have given me.” Huoyun Liu-Li had a lack of understanding on her countenance.</p>
  <p>“Hahaha, in this world of the nine continents, power is everything. With enough power, what is a mere Earthly Paradise? With enough power, we can have ten or over hundreds of them. Back then, it was because I knew that you didn’t wish to move about so much. That was why I handed Earthly Paradise to you. Today, if you are interested in travelling with Qing Shui, Master will support you fully. I will send you both to Continent’s Capital tomorrow. Going there on my mount would be faster.”</p>

 <p>Upon looking at the sight of that smile on Canghai’s face, Qing Shui’s desire ignited. There was an indescribable charm and beauty in that smile of hers!</p>
 <p>“Master, don’t joke about me!” Huoyun appeared somewhat flustered.</p>
 <p>“I’m here today because I wanted to gift you something. I need to leave here and would only be back after a long time.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Leaving here for a long time?” Huoyun bewilderedly asked.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I want to go to the other places of the Greencloud Continent, such as the Continent’s Capital. But I will return to the Hundred Miles City after three years.” Qing Shui passed Huoyun some stuff as he spoke such as a few thousand Drunken Fragrance Fruit, and 90 pieces of Perilla and Thyme leaves.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui said he wanted to visit the Capital of Greencloud Continent, a bright light flickered in Canghai Mingyue’s eyes,</p>
 <p>“Aww, I don’t care! You have to accompany me for two days later. Your room is still empty and always ready for you.” The husky voice of Huoyun Liu-Li was so sexy as though it was hinting at a hidden meaning. Canghai Mingyue was also somewhat taken aback by shock.</p>
 <p>“Master, it’s not what you are thinking.” Huoyun rolled her eyes when she noticed the look of Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“Actually, why don’t you accompany him for leisure and travel about for three years?” Canghai Mingyue smiled as she extended her snow-white dainty hands as she lightly pinched Huoyun Liu-cheeks.</p>
 <p>“I still have to manage the Earthly Paradise that you left me.” Huoyun depressedly replied.</p>
 <p>“Mere worldly possessions, just abandon it or does the little lass love making money too much?” Canghai laughed.</p>
 <p>The words of Canghai Mingyue caused Qing Shui to understand some of her personality. She had an impressive atmosphere about her. She was decisive, and resolute in her decisions, not beating around the bush. It was also because of such an attribute to her personality that further accentuated her charm.</p>
 <p>“This business is the lifeblood of Master, a mission that you have given me.” Huoyun Liu-Li had a lack of understanding on her countenance.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, in this world of the nine continents, power is everything. With enough power, what is a mere Earthly Paradise? With enough power, we can have ten or over hundreds of them. Back then, it was because I knew that you didn’t wish to move about so much. That was why I handed Earthly Paradise to you. Today, if you are interested in travelling with Qing Shui, Master will support you fully. I will send you both to Continent’s Capital tomorrow. Going there on my mount would be faster.”</p>
