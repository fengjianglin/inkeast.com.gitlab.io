 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you miss the Demon Lord Palace?" Qing Shui asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan nodded, "I do feel like wanting to head back. I don't know what to do if I were to stay here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took her hand, "I haven't been able to always be by your side."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan smiled and looked at Qing Shui, "Don't say that. You have always been in my heart. I feel that I don't have to have my guards up against you and I feel that you're the person that I'm the closest to. Thinking of you makes me feel less lonely."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flames ignited in Qing Shui's heart. He was really very happy to hear Tantai Lingyan say these words. Her heart was changing. She could now feel loneliness, or rather, the fact that she could say that she was lonely was already a tremendous improvement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took her tightly into his arms but didn't do anything overboard. He felt full of pity for her. What astonished him was that this cold and beautiful lady did not resist but instead, held him gently at the waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to warm up her body and warm up her heart. He said softly next to her ears, "I love you. I've been thinking of you all these years. If we hadn't started the way we did, I would feel that I wouldn't be able to succeed in winning your heart and would give up. But with that happening, you're my woman now. I'll definitely do my best to give you happiness unless you really hate and detest me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very calm. What he said was the truth. There were only a few men who would be able to remain calm and compose before Tantai Lingyan. It was because this lady was too cold. Even a heart that was burning with passion would be instantly frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, although Tantai Lingyan was very beautiful, no one would attempt to win her heart. Not even people who liked cool beauties. Usually, these people would say that they feel a sense of satisfaction in seeing the instant when the snow melts. However, when the same people saw Tantai Lingyan, they would feel that her frozen heart wouldn't melt. Or at the least, they couldn't succeed in melting her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You were the one to wake me up back then. I didn't want to have any sort of relationship with you back then. There are many things I had to do and I had no idea when I'll be leaving this world. Therefore, I had never thought of other things. I hadn't expected for you to be faster than me and definitely hadn't expected that we'll be able to meet again. When we met the second time, I was really very shocked."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then what about now? How do you feel now?" Qing Shui hugged her slightly tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan said softly, "I'm very happy now. I'm happy to have you around."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Can I take it that you like me?" Qing Shui smiled and said to her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I like you." Tantai Lingyan said softly. It sounded very natural and was like a divine melody to his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui turned to look at Tantai Lingyan, look at her flawless face that was covered with a hint of faint red blush. In addition to her faint smile, she was so beautiful that Qing Shui was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan felt a little embarrassed at his gaze and turned away slightly. Qing Shui got back to his senses and said, smiling, "Clean as ice and pure as jade. Beautiful!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Tantai Lingyan heard Qing Shui complimenting that she was very beautiful, she felt happy as well. Moreover, it was Qing Shui who was the one complimenting her. It was human nature for people to be conscious of their appearances. It was even more so for ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan didn't say anything and her hands had unknowingly let go of Qing Shui. Qing Shui's hand had already wrapped around her slender waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll be staying here for a period of time. Can you head back to the Demon Lord Palace a little later?" Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sure." Tantai Lingyan replied very clearly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;"My dear Lingyan is the best." Qing Shui said happily and even conceitedly planted a kiss on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This surprised both of them. Qing Shui couldn't hold himself back and had done it unintentionally. On the other hand, Tantai Lingyan felt a tug at her heartstrings. Although that thing had happened between them on their first encounter, it had been over 20 years since then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was already prepared to receive Tantai Lingyan's fury but realized that she wasn't actually furious. She lowered her head slightly, blushing. Qing Shui gently tilted up her chin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at her seductive beauty, slightly misted beautiful eyes, looking as if she wanted to resist Qing Shui's hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ice beauty had fallen in love!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t possibly let go of this chance. He slowly reached his head forward and when he saw that Tantai Lingyan wanted to dodge yet not really doing so and that her eyes seemed to be slowly closing, Qing Shui now understood everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His lips pressed against Tantai Lingyan's slightly cool lips. Her lips felt very smooth and there was an indescribable fragrance that was very faint. This wasn't a fragrance that came from something else but was a fragrance that belonged to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body stiffened as she allowed Qing Shui to kiss her gently. She felt very nervous and could only hug Qing Shui, not knowing what to do. Qing Shui let go of her lips slightly, "Be natural. Don't clench your teeth."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, Qing Shui went for the kiss again. This time around, his tongue nimbly probed into her amazing mouth, entangling with her sweet and tender tongue. Qing Shui didn't go crazy. He was seriously enjoying the ecstatic feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After very long, Tantai Lingyan pushed away Qing Shui and panted slightly. She wore an embarrassed expression and didn't dare to look at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't thought of having sex with her right at this moment. It was because he knew that although they had experienced the closest contact before, she was in fact still the same as a lady who hadn't experienced such things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took her hand, "How did it feel?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's hand trembled and she murmured, "Go and die. You're not allowed to talk about such things."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw her behaving like that, he was even happier. Compared to how she was before, she had already changed a lot. This was a good thing. Just then, Qin Qing walked in. The two of them were still holding hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the two of them, Qin Qing was stunned, "I didn't disturb anything, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan quickly let go of Qing Shui's hand and smiled, embarrassed. Qing Shui walked over in a relaxed manner, took Qin QIng's hand and returned to pick up Tantai Lingyan's hand with another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn't the first time such a situation had happened. Therefore, he was very natural with it. The three of them didn't say anything, but everything was very clear in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Qing Shui spent a very relaxed time in the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Other than giving guidance on their cultivation and helping them, he would spend the remaining of his time with the two ladies. Most of the time, it wouldn't be with the three of them together, but occasionally, it would be so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The relationship between Qing Shui and the two ladies didn't progress much. Tantai Lingyan and Qing Shui would only share kisses and she wouldn't even let Qing Shui touch her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation was about the same with Qin Qing. Qing Shui was only able to kiss her as well. Qing Shui wanted to go further but didn't want to make it difficult for them. Moreover, Qing Shui knew that ladies liked to go through the process steps by steps. Qing Shui actually liked it that was as well. It was the best to slowly feel and appreciate the feeling. If one were to swallow directly, no matter how good the taste was, one wouldn't be able to appreciate it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People said that the happiest time passed by the quickest. Unknowingly, another month went by. The Linhai City was always cold. It had been over one month since the new year and the days went on as usual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing had become as close as sisters. Their characters were a little similar and with time, they got closer to each other. Moreover, there was also Qing Shui linking them together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's and Qin Qing's abilities no longer worried Qing Shui. Even though Divinities could defeat them, those who were weaker would not be able to stand up against them. Moreover, Qin Qing still had the Golden Phoenix Scissors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, I'll go with Sister Lingyan to the Demon Lord Palace to take a look." Qin Qing smiled and said to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned for a moment before he gave it some thought and said, "I'll send the two of you there."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need for that. The two of us will be traveling together so there's no need for you to worry." Tantai Lingyan smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave it some thought and felt that what she said was right. Even amongst the Peak False Gods, they were considered to be top notch. Moreover, Tantai Lingyan had the old turtle and Qin Qing had the Azure Dragon. Even then, it wasn't that easy to encounter Divinities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, we’ll be fine. In the past, we didn't have you around and we still managed to live." Qin Qing knew that Qing Shui was worried about them and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Qing Shui smiled. He embraced them each with one of his arms, "Then the two of you, be careful. Come, let me give the two of you a kiss."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing left. Qing Shui knew that they wouldn't be returning anytime soon. He suddenly thought of the Sea King Palace. In the past, he had asked them to help take care of the Sea King Palace. Regardless, he should head over and offer them his thanks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't like to drag things out. Therefore, when he thought about it, he immediately used the Five Elements Divine Flag to appear at the Divine Cave. This time, neither of the two ladies were around and he headed straight for the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had just entered the Sunset Palace's domain when he felt killing intent running amok. Qing Shui moved very quickly and he sensed that there was a powerful aura of battle from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no idea who the Sunset Palace was fighting against, but he needed to go and take a look. With his current abilities, it was very easy for him to make his way there. Qing Shui believed that the Sunset Palace was very powerful and they had many strong experts as well. The Ancient Battle King Crabs, the Ancient Shrimp Generals, the Sea-Dragon Mermen, the Shark Kings, and many others. However, when Qing Shui rushed over, he was still stunned by the scene before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both sides suffered from great casualties but the Sunset Palace's casualties seemed to be greater. Qing Shui saw that three Ancient Golden Battle King Crabs and five Golden Shrimp Generals seriously injured. There were even two deaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the Sunset Palace Lord was fighting against three opponents at the same time. She was already injured, but should still be able to hang on for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the others, the casualties were even greater. The water domain in this area had turned completely red. However, the battle here was in a vacuum and so was Qing Shui's surroundings. The Paragon Water Shield could accomplish this. The piercing stench of blood was so strong that it would make one puke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sunset Palace Lord, submit to me. There are no disadvantages for you in doing so. Our Golden Sand Palace will be able to protect your Sunset Palace." A man who hadn't participated in the battle shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man was actually a mutated&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden Sand Sea-Tiger King</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. These existences were in no way weaker than real dragons. Those who underwent mutations would tend to have unique Heavenly Techniques. Moreover, there had been the mention of the Golden Sand Palace earlier. This person seemed to be the Palace Lord of the Golden Sand Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ones engaged in the battle with the Sunset Palace Mistress were three Ancient Battle Crabs. Two of them were Violet Golden Battle King Crabs while the other one was a Golden Battle King Crab. There were also other powerful existences around them. From this, it was clear that the Golden Sand Palace was of a much higher level than the Sunset Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Go look at your horrible self in the mirror. I'd rather like a pig than like you." The Sunset Palace Mistress said with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt gloomy. She had said before that she had taken a liking to him. Was he a pig...?</span></p>
