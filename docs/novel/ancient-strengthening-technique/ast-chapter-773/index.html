 <p><strong>AST 773 - The Fight Of The Ultimate Life and Death Against The Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan (3)</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>There was a mix of cheers, taunts, and gasps from the surrounding crowd when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant appeared. The five old men in front of Qing Shui seemed to be calm while two of them quickly summoned their demonic beasts as well.</p>
 <p>One of the two demonic beasts was a Blue Fox Demon, which was essentially a Four Colored Poison Beast. The most outstanding characteristic of the Blue Fox Demon was none other than its formidable speed. In any case, what would these old men think if they knew the bite from Donggong Maisun’s Green Bamboo Snake was ineffective against Qing Shui?</p>
 <p>The other demonic beast was a Black Armored Turtle Beast of a cubic meter in size. The defense was quite fragile and its attack power was very weak as well. Despite that, it could attach itself to a human being to act as shield from incoming assaults. This turtle could be used as a disguised battle armor on its owner.</p>
 <p>The other three old men did not call out their mounts or any demonic beasts. It wasn’t strange when Qing Shui thought about it. Up at this point, only beast tamers who could call out their demonic beasts were allowed to join the battle. However, be it a poison beast or a fantastic beast or any demonic beasts that were too difficult to control, they would all be annihilated in an instant by a demonic beast of the strength of one star and above. If that was the case, beast tamers should think twice about letting their demonic beasts into a battle they could never win.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could barely hear the murmurs from the crowd below now. He and the five old men from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan had already flown further up towards the sky. The sky above the Martial God Street was crowded with flying beasts initially but they had already flown about a thousand meters away from the area around the arena. It was best for the audience to spectate such a battle from afar. It was also interesting to note that their altitude in the sky wasn’t the best condition to be in to spectate the fight either.</p>
 <p>Both of Qing Shui and the opposition’s men remained silent. Words were already unnecessary at this point. The most important thing right now was to kill his opponents as soon as possible through the advantage of the first-strike. Qing Shui banished all the unnecessary thoughts from his mind and focused on getting the first-strike without pulling any deceptions that would allow his opponents to make their moves first.</p>
 <p>This was the second round, so he figured that he should reveal some of his powers this time.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant trampled its way towards the old men, while Qing Shui quickly activated his Fiery Golden Eyes and Emperor’s Qi before he followed the elephant as well.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant quickly flashed its way towards the old men and instantly unleashed its Mighty Elephant Stomp. The stomp that contained the strength of seven stars simply wasn’t a technique these old men could withstand with their current strength. Before they could be trampled on, the old men hastily escaped, separating them in the process.</p>
 <p>Everyone dropped their jaws when they witnessed the power displayed by the mighty Diamond Gigantic Elephant. The spectators below quickly stood up in awe. The strength of seven stars was a supremely terrifying power. The old men were all martial warriors with the strength of peak five stars. They didn’t stand a chance, because even those with the strength of six stars could still be in extreme danger in front of a being with the strength of seven stars - they could end up dead with an instantaneous kill by a seven star being.</p>
 <p>“Is he a beast tamer? Why is this demonic beast so strong? Does he have other demonic beasts like this too?</p>
 <p>Within a few seconds, the spectators below burst out in another discussion. Some who had initially looked down on Qing Shui had begun to gain some admiration towards him. However, this was the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death against the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan, so getting too involved with this fight would be a waste. No one wanted to bet their money on the fight because it wasn’t worth betting in the first place.</p>
 <p>“Elder sister, the elephant is so awesome.”</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan remained silent as she patted Ye Yan’s head gently. She finally allowed herself a genuine smile when she saw how strong Qing Shui’s demonic beast was. Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, and Bai Gui, on the other hand, were surprised by the strength of the elephant. They never expected a normal-looking demonic beast would possess an abominable strength like this, at least not with the strength of seven stars.</p>
 <p>However, the strength of the elephant was beginning to make sense to them after realizing the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s recent surge in power. Even if that was the case, the elephant was already considered strong based on its previous strength of Martial Saint. This, however, was out of their expectation.</p>
 <p>……….</p>
 <p>The Mighty Elephant Stomp had successfully dispersed the initial formation of the old men. It was sudden too, so the old men had no choice but to separate themselves to two sides; three on the left side, and two on the right side. Naturally, Qing Shui would never pass up on this opportunity, so with an Instantaneous Diamond Evasion move, he quickly flashed towards those old men. With the current level of the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion, he could now move a longer distance towards a direction.</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Shield Attack was able to knock one of the old men away from on the right side. This old man was the one with the Blue Fox Demon. However, the Blue Fox Demon was nothing against him but he still reminded himself to be careful so that the demonic beast would not be able to land an attack on him.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The force of the Mighty Elephant Stomp had created a mist of black cloud in the center, blocking both the path and view of the three old men on the other side. It was only for a moment, but two corpses had already fallen from the sky towards the ground.</p>
 <p>The sky returned to normal after that. The three old men stared at the young man in front of them blankly, unable to grasp why their two comrades had fallen so quickly. The expressions on the three old men changed immediately as the dull thumping of the corpses rang out from the ground.</p>
 <p>It turned out that Qing Shui had also knocked the other old man with his shield after the first one. He had also shot out two poison needles towards those one of the old men, to poison him. However, it wasn’t the needles that had killed him but the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable that Qing Shui had thrown towards him at that moment. The sable was already quite fast and with Qing Shui’s flexibility and strength, the sable acted as a hidden weapon as it scratched the old man as he was being thrown backwards from the shield. Having been afflicted with poison twice, the old man died instantly. The venom from the poison needles was quite strong as well…...</p>
 <p>Now wasn’t the time to use his items sparingly, so Qing Shui didn’t feel petty when he threw out a few poison needles. But if he could, he would restrict himself from using all of them because he had other members of the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan that needed to be killed too.</p>
 <p>When the other old man saw his comrade going down, he went straight to save him. It was fine for Qing Shui as he didn’t need to find another way to catch up to him. Without further hesitation, he quickly flashed towards the old man and aimed his attack at the old man’s head with the Thunder God.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled his power to the level slightly lower than his opponent’s defense, which caused the Critical Damage to ignore half of the old man’s defense instantly. With the State of One with Elephant activated, the old man was severely wounded on the spot. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable went straight for that old man even without Qing Shui’s command, killing him on the spot.</p>
 <p>Three more to go. Qing Shui quickly made an estimation in his head; with five dead on the first battle, two in the current battle, and seven at the Ye Residence, he had killed a total 14 members from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan. All of them were Peak Martial Saints too…..</p>
 <p>Even the Blue Fox Demon had been killed by Qing Shui with his bare hands before being thrown into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. At this point, demonic beasts of the Martial Saint level were nothing in the eyes of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>His opponents became timid when they knew how fragile they were right now. Qing Shui, on the other hand, was feeling bolder than before. He needed to boost his courage because he had to face a line of stronger opponents after this. Among the three old men in front of him, two possessed the strength of five stars. But after they had been weakened by the Fiery Golden Eyes and Emperor’s Qi, their strength was reduced to somewhere around three and a half stars.</p>
 <p>Only when one had been afflicted with the weakening effect would they feel the despair crawling up to them. Qing Shui was now more or less on par with his opponents after he had gained a surge of power from the State of One with Elephant technique.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui repeated his old tactic but this time, his opponents began to strike as well. Facing three opponents at the same time - with two of them being stronger than himself - he needed to use another technique in order to win this round. With that in mind, he quickly took out two black Frosted Iron Balls, ready for the next strike.</p>
 <p>When his opponents showed a frightened expression, Qing Shui wasted no time and shot the Frosted Iron Balls towards the old man in the middle. Even though the old men had already retreated backwards, their speed was no match for the speed of the hidden weapons. The Frosted Iron Ball was considered Qing Shui’s deadliest weapon so far. If he wanted to kill those who were stronger than him, he needed to depend on his hidden weapons in order to do so.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>When the Frosted Iron Balls got closer to the targets, the old man with the weakest strength quickly realized that they could no longer evade the incoming poisonous balls. Having accepted his fate, he took the fall for his other two comrades and blocked the Frosted Iron Balls with his own body, which ultimately led to his death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Frosted Iron Balls, that had been tempered with poison, were just enough to kill a man of such strength. If he hadn’t weakened their powers from the beginning, the hidden weapon technique Twin Dragon Explosion would not yield the result he had expected.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he had wasted two Frosted Iron Balls on one person. As he turned his attention to the remaining two old men, who were clearly frightened for their lives, he realized that it may not be a waste at all. At the very least, the horrific death of their comrades had somehow diminished their combat capabilities by about 20%.</p>
 <p>It was time for another kill!</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>A pink sword qi three meters long was shot out by the Diamond Gigantic Elephant as it trampled across the sky in a vigorous motion. This skill was awakened after the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had consumed the ‘Origin Essence Pellet’ that he had received during the demon refining at the Stellar Horse Lake.</p>
 <p>The pink sword qi flew towards the two old men at a moderate speed. The speed was not as fast as Qing Shui’s hidden weapons - it was quite inferior to be exact - but the old men found it impossible to evade the sword qi as they could only watch it inching closer with fearful eyes…...</p>
 <p>Did the Diamond Sword Qi have a breakthrough?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was curious. When he had the Diamond Gigantic Elephant use the skill for the first time as a trial, it was not as powerful as he remembered. The power of the sword qi felt stronger now and the size of the qi seemed to have grown bigger. Qing Shui had always thought that the size of the sword qi was normal until he realized the change in the power was directly proportional to the size as well.</p>
 <p>Now it seemed that the Diamond Sword Qi had gone through a slight change without him noticing it.</p>
 <p>The two old men from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan tried to block the giant sword qi with their weapons instead of evading the sword qi entirely. Qing Shui felt quite perplexed at their action but as he was still judging their decision, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had already rushed towards the old men with an assault.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Diamond Attack!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant knocked itself against the one of the old men with a ferocious might, knocking that old man to the far end while spilling fresh blood aimlessly in the air. Realizing his comrade was dead and the pink sword qi had vanished, the remaining old man retreated as fast as he could.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was dumbfounded with his Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Ferocious Diamond Attack. Since when did that attack become that powerful…… he felt that the power of the attack had doubled, kind of.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui mounted his Diamond Gigantic Elephant and brought the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable with him to kill the last one - the one with the Black Armored Turtle Beast. After it was done, the battle had ended. Qing Shui came out victorious once again but the crowd below were silent, albeit momentarily.</p>
 <p>It was deathly silent as the spectators looked at the young man standing proudly beside his demonic beasts with astonished gazes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, on the other hand, was busy analyzing his Diamond Gigantic Elephant through his Heavenly Vision Technique. He tried to analyze the Diamond Sword Qi first because he had never paid any attention to it before. Once he got a good look at it, his heart almost skipped a beat.</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi: A giant sword qi would lock onto the target and initiate an assault autonomously. During the period of the assault, the target would not be able to move, until the Diamond Sword Qi had vanished completely. When the target attempted to block the Diamond Sword Qi, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s attack power would be doubled instantly. The time and the chance of the locking the Diamond Sword Qi on the target would depend on the target’s ability. This technique could be used once a day.</p>
 <p>“No wonder the Ferocious Diamond Attack felt like it had doubled its power. So it’s true. Too bad it can only be used once per day.” pondered Qing Shui. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant originally had the strength of 7000 countries. It could reach to about 14000 countries when the Diamond Qi has been activated. If the elephant initiated the Ferocious Diamond Attack, its power would double, leading to about the strength of 28000 countries. If the Diamond Sword Qi were to activate itself, the elephant’s power could go up to the strength of 56000 countries, which was more than the strength of five and a half stars. At this moment, if the elephant were to knock itself against a martial warrior with the strength of three and a half stars, the martial warrior would be dead instantly.</p>
 <p>This was a demonic beast that lived for the sake of battles.</p>
 <p>The expression on the old man from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan immediately changed. He seemed to have realized something - ten strong martial warriors of the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan had been annihilated in a blink of an eye. It might as well be his own doing!</p>
