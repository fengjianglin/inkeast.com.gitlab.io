 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang didn't say anything but merely wore a faint smile. Right now, she felt very relaxed. Having experienced life and death twice within the same day, she learned to accept many things. It was as if she was able to see through the meaning of life more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People tended to say that one's vision determined one's height. There were also people who claimed that one's height determined one's vision. In a way, these two were actually connected. Earlier, Shen Huang had been unable to walk out of her own chains. Everyone had a threshold that they were unable to pass through. This was Shen Huang's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even though she was still unable to cross it at the moment, this was no longer impossible nor would it be able to restrict her. If there were no accidents, she would be able to walk out of it slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You've changed." Qing Shui sensed that Shen Huang's aura had gone through a major change and he looked at her and said in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them sat very closely next to each other. Qing Shui’s mind was still thinking about how he could help her walk out of this. There were two ways to go about doing this. The first one was the better way and it would allow her to walk out of it. However, It would require time. The other way was to catalyze it directly, causing her to feel that all of her hopes are crushed. There would be nothing more which her true heart had wanted to protect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw her determination during the moment she had lost herself, he knew that he must do his best to treat her with his medical skills. He would only gamble with another method if he couldn't save her with his medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, Qing Shui's medical skills were even more powerful than his cultivation. It seemed that this method wasn't bad either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Have I really changed?" Shen Huang smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmmm. You've become beautiful, and you smile a lot more now. You've become an existence that I can truly feel. It's unlike the feeling before, when I couldn't touch you even when you were right next to me." Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui said this, it was unknown if he did it intentionally but he had placed a greater emphasis on the word 'touch'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang threw a glance toward Qing Shui before saying, "I suddenly feel that the world is a lot brighter now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still something else which she did not mention. It was only because of Qing Shui that she felt that the world had become a bit brighter than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui wouldn't know this. He wasn't that much of a narcissist and believed that Shen Huang wouldn't like him. After all, he already had other women and she clearly knew that. Therefore, he wouldn't think of things in this direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, it was already evening. Qing Shui knew that it was time for him to leave. Shen Huang got up and walked alongside Qing Shui as he headed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Even if the Dancing Phoenix Continent is currently unstable, it's much more peaceful than before. If there aren’t any accidents, The Golden Phoenix organization will end up in Huo Feng’s hands. Was the person from the Heavy Region Sword Sect who died the Sect Master?" It was only now, when Qing Shui was curious about the mysterious person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's indeed the Sect Master. But with him dead, there's likely to be a new one soon. Furthermore, they'd be in high morale, wanting to seek revenge for the previous Sect Master." When they were having their meal previously, someone came to report the situation to Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Seek what revenge? How dare they come to stir trouble when we haven't even gone to them and wipe out their Heavy Region Sword Sect?" Qing Shui said in contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Crude!" Shen Huang smiled and said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You look very charming when you smile. You should smile more in the future. There's no need to send me off any further. I'll take my leave. There's still the Shadow Phoenix Pavilion. The few people who have died aren't sufficient to inflict much damage, but the situation has been changed." Qing Shui stopped and reported to Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He started off teasing Shen Huang, but was very serious when he moved on to something else. Shen Huang reassured him, "There's actually no need to worry too much about the Dancing Phoenix Continent. I've been too reckless previously."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that it wasn't that she had been reckless, but that she had an attitude of hating the world. Moreover, the other party had threatened her using Huo Feng and she also had too much confidence in herself. When she hadn't expected them to use the Intoxicated Immortal Fragrance, she was caught off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the way back, Qing Shui kept on wondering who was it that had killed that Formation Master and the man with a bulky physique from the Heavy Region Sword Sect. Since he couldn't find the answer, he decided to not think too deeply about it. After all, if he acted a little more careful, there were only a few people in the Dancing Phoenix Continent would be able to pose a threat to him at his current cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything at home was normal and the formations around the Qing Clan had been removed. It wouldn't be a huge problem for the people from Qing Clan to keep them activated. Although they weren't highly proficient in the formations, they would be able to move around the formations around the residence with great ease. The only exceptions were the children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning, Qing Shui returned to the peaceful life from before. It was as if all the things that were brewing in the Dancing Phoenix Continent had nothing to do with him at all. He continued to enjoy the joy of family life as well as help the members of Qing Clan get stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man from the Soaring Dragon Continent's Great Yan Dynasty was the Dragon Saber Battle God Inheritor. However, he was already old so Qing Shui didn't factor him in. He had no idea if his daughter would be able to pick up after the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's women were outstanding and powerful, but Qing Shui felt that it was a little difficult for them. The Dragon Saber battle techniques weren't suitable for women. Therefore, he hoped that one of the three brothers would be able to inherit it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Zun and Qing Ming were very stable and after a few more years, they would exude a brilliant glow. Luan Luan was comparatively faster than the others. She could be said to always be at the forefront of people her age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan had grown up and matured. She was now a full grown adult and had many powerful demonic beasts. She herself was also very strong and there was no one restricting her. She could make her own decisions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Zun and Qing Yin had also been making their own decisions but they didn't have much experience in far distance traveling. If they were to travel, it would be best for them to have a companion. On the contrary, Qing Ming tended to be a loner and had more experience in this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Zun and the others were all at Early Martial Emperor but their abilities have stabilized a lot. Therefore, from then on, they would enter a phase of rapid progression until they have reached Peak Martial Emperor without stopping at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The time they would take was expected to be around three to five years and would not surpass eight years. Qing Shui had the ability to assess such things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their progression rate was a lot slower when compared to Qing Shui's. Even Luan Luan's progression was a lot slower than his. That was expected. After all, Qing Shui was like playing a game with cheats. If he had fewer treasures, he would be far behind from Luan Luan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a few days time, news came in saying that both the Fire Phoenix Organization and the Golden Phoenix Organization had come under the Phoenix God Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was something that Qing Shui was unaware of. Ever since that day, Huo Feng had thought things through and gave up on Shen Huang. In his mind, Shen Huang was deemed to become Qing Shui's.</span></p>

The Phoenix God Organization would not take action to deal with the Shadow Phoenix Pavilion in the short term. It was most likely due to the fact that they won't be able to wipe them out completely and if they failed to do so, the consequences would be very troublesome.</span></p>
