The Buddha Ultimate Technique</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a powerful physique. Furthermore, he had his own ability to protect his body. Thus, it was very easy if he intended to block the killer Qi. This also had to do with the fact that Qing Shui was more powerful than his opponent in terms of strength. If the opponent had been stronger, it would have been very difficult for Qing Shui to block the sword Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hand and pointed out his finger. His figure immediately flashed like a sword shadow. He managed to land his finger on the opponent’s chest just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xicheng Yeyang immediately spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood and got blown away backward. That single finger strike had already hurt his internal core. It was always said that fists were inferior to palms. Palms were inferior to fingers. In any case, the fingers still possessed a fearsome wounding prowess, especially at the moment when they were aimed at the target’s acupoints. Qing Shui would combine his Nine Yang Qi along with his Origin Qi and deliver them deep into the opponent’s body. It was even more powerful than the sword Qis emitted from by the Xicheng clan practitioners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hated Xicheng Yeyang. Before this, he was already quite upset when they talked outside. Adding that he was Tianhe Renmo’s arch nemesis, it was very likely that in the future, they would stand in front of each other as enemies. With that being the case, he didn’t feel the need to hold back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Xicheng Yeyang’s head turned completely blank. In fact, his head was still dwelling around the things which Qing Shui said earlier, “How about you pretend to spurt out a mouthful of fresh blood?” It was constantly traveling back and forth his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, no one dared to continue coming up the stage. Anyone could tell that Qing Shui was not an ordinary man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lot of people knew that the genius of the Xicheng Clan wouldn’t agree to put up an act with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped gazing upon Xicheng Yeyang who fell off the stage. He moved his sight onto Beiming Xue. He could feel that she was keeping an eye on him. He then smiled and nodded, “Nice to meet you, Young Lady Beiming.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice to meet you too. This is such a coincidence,” Beiming Xue smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan was on a platform not far away from theirs as she looked at those two. Her eyes were filled with curiosity as she had her attention set on Qing Shui and Beiming Xue. She seemed to have seen through something. Somehow, she had a feeling that something would happen between those two. It was an instinct. However, for now, they didn’t seem to know each other very well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there was another person standing on the final platform. It was a man who had looked middle aged. Qing Shui didn’t know him, but Beiming Xue told him that it was someone from the Qiao Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that, things became clear to Qing Shui. The Qiao Clan of Dazang City. He seemed to have run into a bit of conflict with them when he first arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like that, all ten platforms had people standing on them. Naturally, those who didn’t get to be on the stage would feel upset, but what could they do about it? This was a society where strength spoke for all. This was fixed wherever one went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After fifteen minutes, the spell on the platform began to shine with bright light. Following on, all ten of the warriors disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others dispersed from the platforms. They began leading their own squads to treasure-hunt around the surroundings. There were a lot of treasures around here. They should already consider themselves lucky to be able to be there. As for the internal part of the Spiritual Land, only ten chosen people were allowed to be in it. Many people had best stop dreaming about going there in their entire lifetimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui regained consciousness almost instantly. He realized that he was in the room of a palace. This place was said to be the internal part of the huge statue from before. At the moment, ten people were standing there. The entire place looked very empty and its internal part was decorated with a golden Buddha statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Buddha statue was significantly smaller than the stone statue from before, but it was still bigger than a human. It was about three meters tall and two meters wide. It gave people the feeling that it was very thick. It was also giving out bright Buddha Light Treasure Qi. The others were just calmly observing the statue. Qing Shui, on the other hand, stood on the side frozen in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Buddha Light Treasure Qi across his body had actually begun to link with the ones around the Buddha statue in a formless way. The Golden Buddha Treasure Qi across his body was getting stronger and stronger. This fact excited Qing Shui very much. Without a doubt, the ability of the Buddha Light Treasure Qi was very powerful. It was something which one could only see but never to dream about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because Qing Shui didn’t know how to cultivate the Buddha Light Treasure Qi that was in his body. He didn’t know how he could improve it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, the Buddha Light Treasure Qi across his body was being raised rapidly. Even Qing Shui was frightened by the speed at which it was growing. After a while, the treasure Qi around the Buddha statue disappeared. Qing Shui examined his body and realized that his own Buddha Light Treasure Qi was raised by 20%. There was a total of ten Buddha statues in the palace, that meant that he could at least improve his strength by two times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Buddha Light Treasure Qi could improve every function of the human body. Endurance, the Bloodline Forces, and so on. There was no need to list out its basic benefits. It could even fight against evil forces invading the body and poisons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others walked around the Buddha statues. They were waiting for the Buddha statues to bestow them their gifts. The people who came in before, would all get gifts that were like presents from God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, everyone had their legs crossed while sitting down. They were waiting for their presents from God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui had also sat down. Unlike them, Qing Shui was taking in the Buddha Light Treasure Qi. Just this Qi was already a massive profit for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The treasure qi from each of the Buddha statues was being absorbed by Qing Shui one by one. Especially when he advanced to the Buddha statues that were at the back, their treasure Qi seemed to be increasing constantly. By the time he reached the final one, the treasure Qi it contained was three times more significant than the others. Qing Shui observed the Buddha statue but didn’t manage to spot any difference. Despite that, Qing Shui still approached it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also didn’t know why. It might be so that he could get closer to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui took in the final bit of Buddha Light Treasure Qi, something appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Light Seal, Buddha Diamond Seal, Buddha Wisdom Seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Light Seal: The supreme Buddha hand seal. It could cause a temporary dizziness to its opponent. The period of effect would depend on the opponent’s strength and spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Diamond Seal: The supreme buddha hand seal. It increased the user’s defense by a fixed amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Wisdom Seal: The supreme buddha hand seal. Decrease the opponent’s offensive prowess by a fixed amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and looked into the surroundings. Everyone had smiles on their faces. It seemed they must have gotten their own benefits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Qing Shui was feeling comfortable. Before this, he had heard about the Great Light Seal, but he never thought that he would actually find it himself. Furthermore, this one seemed to be powerful, causing dizziness in the target. Even stalling for seconds, it would be enough for Qing Shui to kill his target instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below it, were the Buddha Diamond Seal and Buddha Wisdom Seal which were both very powerful. To people like Qing Shui who had formidable defensive prowess, this could be considered as a Divine Technique. As of now, Qing Shui’s defensive prowess was already extremely strong under the effect of Buddha Light Treasure Qi.</span></p>

Only now did Qing Shui realize that the hall was shut tightly before, but it wasn’t exactly black. It was just relatively dark.</span></p>

Three people were teaming up together, whereas another group had four. He immediately started thinking, “Would there be any civil wars breaking out here?”</span></p>

By now, even he himself wasn’t exactly sure how powerful it was. He could only be sure that it must be strong. His most powerful trait was his defense. At the same time, his offensive prowess also increased. As for this one, Qing Shui knew that it was roughly around seven billions Dao Force. The only thing which was unknown to him was his defensive prowess. The reason being that it had surpassed the ordinary level which a person should have.</span></p>

This was a taboo among warriors. Unless it was someone particularly close to them, they wouldn’t speak much about it.</span></p>
