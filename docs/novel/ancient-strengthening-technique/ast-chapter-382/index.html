 <p><strong>Chapter 382 Moonstone Viewing Platform, Golden Pearl, Qing Shui is going to the Yan Clan?.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 382 - Moonstone Viewing Platform, Golden Pearl, Qing Shui is going to the Yan Clan?</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Interspatial silk sachet? What’s that?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue took the sachet from Qing Shui and—as if she had seen the most beautiful thing on earth—lifted her head towards Qing Shui. “Interspatial sachet is made from special beast hides that are above the Martial Saint level. I know Martial Saint-level Demonic Beast, Ardentwind Bird is one of them.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Martial Saint-level Demonic Beast, Ardentwind Bird?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, this bird is around 1 feet in length with a phoenix crest on its head. The wings, when extended, are only 2 meters in length, but it is a powerful Martial Saint level beast. Its greatest value is the fur on its wings, which can be made into sachets to contain large items. It is a magical item; there are few people that own it, and those who have it are from huge clans or aristocratic families.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue’s words formed a thought in Qing Shui’s mind: this Interspatial Silk Sachet was the Interspatial Ring, or Interspatial Pouch, in the world of nine continents.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This Interspatial Silk Sachet seems to have a tiny storage Interspatial.” Qing Shui recalled that it only contained a few bottles of medicinal pellets and a treasure map.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can I open it?” Canghai Mingyue asked cautiously.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course, you can even have it if you want,” Qing Shui replied with a smile. He did not care if it was a Interspatial Silk Sachet, since it would probably not be as convenient as his Realm of Violet Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue smiled and slowly opened it. There were 3 white ceramic bottles and a piece of paper in it, but she ignored them and extended her snow white hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A wave of snowy white Qi of Xiantian swirled on her palm!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It eased into the Interspatial Silk Sachet!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When it appeared again, there was an item in her hand!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A golden, shining writing brush!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. It was true to what the legends had said about the Spatial Items, but at that instant, Qing Shui had another idea - did Martial Saint Dan Qing really die in the Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at the glimmering writing brush intently. It was slightly more than a feet long. Although he did not touch it directly, Qing Shui knew the brush was definitely not made of gold, but the same material as his Gold Needles, Gold Extract Essence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The colour of the brush was entirely golden, but Qing Shui could guess that the “Spiritual Qi” radiating from the golden hairs was similarly extracted from Martial Saint level beasts.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such a tiny writing brush that expended such high costs, it must be the one Martial Saint Dan Qing had used before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Cultivate Qi of Xiantian and extend your hand in and you will know, you will see everything,” Canghai Mingyue handed over the writing brush and Interspatial Silk Sachet without batting an eyelid.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not put his hand in to try, but used his Heavenly Vision immediately after receiving the sachet. One look, and Qing Shui was dazed. Other than the small surface level, there was actually another Interspatial that was grey and foggy. It was not big, only about 2 square meters, and it did not appear crystal clear.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were many items in it, including writing brushes, paper, and inkstone, but most importantly, Qing Shui spotted a scroll painting. It was a portrait identical to Portraits of Beauty, unravelled, but Qing Shui was sure that it was a Portrait of Beauty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and extended his hand into the Interspatial Silk Sachet. It was easy to retrieve the items using his psyche force and spirit energy, after which an ink slab appeared!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Moonstone Ink Slab!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue blurted out in shock.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Moonstone Ink Slab?” Qing Shui realized he had little knowledge. Things that made Canghai Mingyue exclaim in surprise must be good.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Moonstone is a valuable ore from the world of nine continents. It is said to have dropped from the moon, and it contains powerful spiritual Qi that can forge armour and weapons, as well as items that scholars love. Just like this ink slab, words or drawings created using the ink produced by it will be filled with a spiritual nature,” Canghai Mingyue stared at the ink slab in Qing Shui’s hands and explained.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui was sure that this Interspatial silk sachet belonged to Martial Saint Dan Qing. There was no need to guess whether the latter had died in Ten Thousand Turtle Swamp, since he was an ancient character and there was no significance in knowing the answer to that. Qing Shui had only been interested because of the Portraits of Beauty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out one of the 3 white ceramic bottles and passed it to Canghai Mingyue. “Yueyue, are you familiar with the items in it?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now called Canghai Mingyue “Yue yue”, not to take advantage of her, but because calling her Mingyue would remind him of Mingyue Gelou. Just looking at Canghai Mingyue had subconsciously reminded him of Mingyue Gelou. If he still referred to her as Mingyue...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue had a keen eye for details and noticed how Qing Shui was calling her amorously by her nickname, although she noted the absence of any teasing in his expression.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Opening the white ceramic bottle, Canghai Mingyue glanced at it and frowned before turning back to look at Qing Shui. She had been curious about how Qing Shui had obtained the Interspatial silk sachet, especially now that she recognized the items in the ceramic bottle.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Golden Beads!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“These are Golden Beads from Central Continent, very expensive medicinal pellets!” Canghai Mingyue softly told him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Golden Beads?” Qing Shui looked at the golden round balls in the bottle. The name was apt, but what effect did they have independently and when combined with Pure Gold Mystic Turtle Core and Greencloud Up-step Pellet?&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It was said that these golden beads were valuable medicines in the Buddhist Clan of Central Continent that strengthen one’s body. Eating one per day can increase a Xiantian’s strength by 300jin. For those above Xiantian but below Martial King, one pill can increase 500jin of strength, and for those above Martial King level, 1 pill would increase 1000jin of strength. Those below Xiantian can consume up to 2 pills per year, those above Xiantian but below Martial King can consume up to 3 pills per year, and those above Martial King level can eat up to 5 pills per year forever.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After listening to Canghai Mingyue’s words, Qing Shui was certain that these “Golden Beads” were good stuff. The main advantage was the lack of limitation, though the increment in abilities were less for those of lower levels. Nevertheless, there was a powerful aspect - the fact that one could consume the pills forever as long as he complied with the maximum amount for each year. Also, one must have a sufficient supply of these “Golden Beads”.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also noticed the other items within the Interspatial silk sachet. Other than the heavenly-defying pellets Qing Shui had eaten, there were the “Golden Beads”, Golden Essence Writing Brush, and the Moonstone Ink Slab.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was also the Portrait of Beauty, but Qing Shui had already put it into the Realm of Violet Immortal when he was touching the ink slab. Thus, Qing Shui did not have much interest in them despite the fact that there were still some interesting items in the sachet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is for you!” Qing Shui passed the Interspatial silk sachet and a bottle of golden beads into Canghai Mingyue’s hands. Among these items, the Interspatial silk sachet was actually the most valuable one.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah, I don’t want it, it’s too precious,” Canghai Mingyue rejected hurriedly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“These are useless to me, take it. It will be more convenient for you to have it. Liu-li is often with you, it will be good for both of you to carry some of these.” Qing Shui smiled and thrusted the sachet into Canghai Mingyue’s arms.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue hesitated for a minute, recalling how Qing Shui would occasionally whip out some things and guessed that he must have something like this spatial item. She thought about everything that happened between them and stared at his pair of clear, sincere eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do we still need those two words between us?” Qing Shui asked with a grin.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If not for these two words, I won’t know how to express myself…”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let me hug you. I really feel like hugging you!” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue’s deep, beautiful eyes with his own pair of clear eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was the first time this powerful and fatally beautiful woman became flustered and avoided eye contact with Qing Shui. Canghai Mingyue felt her heart beating fast and realized that the man before her had grown and suddenly matured.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui. Qing Shui had discovered that this fatally beautiful woman could also be as gentle as water.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue stood up lightly and walked to Qing Shui’s side.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at the hint of sadness in Qing Shui’s crystal clear eyes, she extended her jade arms and gently wrapped them around Qing Shui’s neck, her flushed cheeks making her pretty face all the more alluring.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wrapped his arms around her slender waist and observed the beautiful face that only centimeters away from him. Like this moment, he felt surreal every time such a lady leaned on his chest...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, are you going to the Yan Family?”&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“It was said that these golden beads were valuable medicines in the Buddhist Clan of Central Continent that strengthen one’s body. Eating one per day can increase a Xiantian’s strength by 300jin. For those above Xiantian but below Martial King, one pill can increase 500jin of strength, and for those above Martial King level, 1 pill would increase 1000jin of strength. Those below Xiantian can consume up to 2 pills per year, those above Xiantian but below Martial King can consume up to 3 pills per year, and those above Martial King level can eat up to 5 pills per year forever.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After listening to Canghai Mingyue’s words, Qing Shui was certain that these “Golden Beads” were good stuff. The main advantage was the lack of limitation, though the increment in abilities were less for those of lower levels. Nevertheless, there was a powerful aspect - the fact that one could consume the pills forever as long as he complied with the maximum amount for each year. Also, one must have a sufficient supply of these “Golden Beads”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also noticed the other items within the Interspatial silk sachet. Other than the heavenly-defying pellets Qing Shui had eaten, there were the “Golden Beads”, Golden Essence Writing Brush, and the Moonstone Ink Slab.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was also the Portrait of Beauty, but Qing Shui had already put it into the Realm of Violet Immortal when he was touching the ink slab. Thus, Qing Shui did not have much interest in them despite the fact that there were still some interesting items in the sachet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is for you!” Qing Shui passed the Interspatial silk sachet and a bottle of golden beads into Canghai Mingyue’s hands. Among these items, the Interspatial silk sachet was actually the most valuable one.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah, I don’t want it, it’s too precious,” Canghai Mingyue rejected hurriedly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“These are useless to me, take it. It will be more convenient for you to have it. Liu-li is often with you, it will be good for both of you to carry some of these.” Qing Shui smiled and thrusted the sachet into Canghai Mingyue’s arms.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue hesitated for a minute, recalling how Qing Shui would occasionally whip out some things and guessed that he must have something like this spatial item. She thought about everything that happened between them and stared at his pair of clear, sincere eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do we still need those two words between us?” Qing Shui asked with a grin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If not for these two words, I won’t know how to express myself…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let me hug you. I really feel like hugging you!” Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue’s deep, beautiful eyes with his own pair of clear eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was the first time this powerful and fatally beautiful woman became flustered and avoided eye contact with Qing Shui. Canghai Mingyue felt her heart beating fast and realized that the man before her had grown and suddenly matured.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui. Qing Shui had discovered that this fatally beautiful woman could also be as gentle as water.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue stood up lightly and walked to Qing Shui’s side.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at the hint of sadness in Qing Shui’s crystal clear eyes, she extended her jade arms and gently wrapped them around Qing Shui’s neck, her flushed cheeks making her pretty face all the more alluring.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wrapped his arms around her slender waist and observed the beautiful face that only centimeters away from him. Like this moment, he felt surreal every time such a lady leaned on his chest...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, are you going to the Yan Family?”&nbsp;</p>
