 <p><strong>AST 956 - Elegance Could Be Bone-Deep Too, Lei Clan?</strong></p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui had said it, Lady Duanmu and Duanmu Lingshuang didn’t say anything else. The three of them laughed and made their way towards a remote smaller courtyard.</p>
 <p>“I’m just going to watch from a further distance!” Duanmu Lingshuang looked at the little fellow in her arms and smiled at Qing Shui and Lady Duanmu.</p>
 <p>“Alright, best to not frighten the little fellow.” Qing Shui rubbed the back of little fellow’s head. He then walked towards Hu Yanlin, who was sweating heavily in the distance, along with Lady Duanmu.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Ox Fist!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was able to identify that Hu Yanlin was practicing the Ferocious Ox Fist with just a single glance. There were quite a lot of people who knew this fist technique because it was a low-level fist technique. However, it was very suitable for him to practice it now, as his cultivation was not high. Besides, the main objectives of him practicing this fist technique was to temper his body and bones and the Ferocious Ox Fist was just the fist technique for tempering the body and bones.</p>
 <p>The muscles on Hu Yanlin’s body seemed to be very powerful and very strong, but it wasn’t to extent of creating a terrifying visual impact. He merely looked very strong. He was panting very heavily right now. Yet his every fist was very serious and could even be considered meticulous.</p>
 <p>“If you can’t maintain a normal Qi circulation and breathing, then stop. Otherwise, your cultivation is ineffective,” Qing Shui’s voice rang out, interrupting Hu Yanlin.</p>
 <p>“Mother, Mister Qing!” Hu Yanlin respectfully greeted Lady Duanmu and then greeted Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very happy in his heart while he watched that smile that was simple and honest. It wasn’t easy to be him because the person he married was Duanmu Lingshuang. It was no easy feat for someone like him to just survive with his strength.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui wasn’t wrong in his guess, he must’ve been challenged by quite a number of people. If he refused, he would be insulted as a coward or softballs. If he couldn’t endure his opponent’s provocation or tolerate that kind of humiliation and let blood rush to his head, then only death awaited him.</p>
 <p>It seemed like he should be carrying a very heavy burden upon him right now.</p>
 <p>So he strove hard and endured the pain. Hitting the lowest point in life and enduring humiliation for a short while didn’t really matter. When one stood at the pinnacle of men in a year, a decade or even a century, he would be able to forget all the humiliation he had gone through. The disgraces from the past would toughen him and broaden his insight…</p>
 <p>All humans were narrow-minded and could only see the present and future or even the present only. It didn’t matter how glorious one was in the past, as long as they lost everything in the present or was a fool, they would no longer be of any value to the others.</p>
 <p>That was why Qing Shui found this man very admirable. He treated the people closest to him very well. If he knew that a person important to him was in danger, he would turn into a fearless wolf.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t mind, I can teach you another fist technique. It is stronger than this Ferocious Ox Fist,” Qing Shui offered with a smile.</p>
 <p>Hu Yanlin hesitated for a moment. He was also quite an obstinate man or more like he didn’t like to owe others favor.</p>
 <p>“Yanlin, you should thank Qing Shui.” Lady Duanmu smiled. She knew if she didn’t say anything, this son-in-law of hers would be very reluctant to accept Qing Shui’s offer. So she spoke up.</p>
 <p>Accepting Qing Shui’s good will now wasn’t as heavy as before. After hearing what Qing Shui had said earlier, she had also come to realize something else too.</p>
 <p>There was no need to reject the benevolence of others sometimes. But of course, assistance that had an ulterior motive behind it should be reconsidered. For most of the time, the important thing was to think about how to draw support from the other’s assistance to get back on one’s feet. Strength was an insurance. It was fine to draw support from those with ulterior motives, at least one wouldn’t feel like they owed favors to the others by doing so. They only had to think about how to get back on their feet.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Mister Qing,” Hu Yanlin laughed and scratched his head.</p>
 <p>“You’re welcome. Watch closely!”</p>
 <p>Right after Qing Shui finished his sentence, he started to demonstrate the Back Connecting Fist. His every movement was very slow, yet of a very high realm and it also gave people a very deep impression. Every single movement of the Back Connecting Fist was slowly demonstrated.</p>
 <p>After he was done with one round, Qing Shui started another round again. This time, he slowed down his movements even more and explained a sentence or more for every form.</p>
 <p>Qi from Dantian, connect the energy through the back…...</p>
 <p>Tense up both legs, put all force in the right leg, smash the left shoulder downwards…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued demonstrating it a few more times before he stopped to look at Hu Yanlin. “Try it a few times.”</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Hu Yanlin replied with slight excitement before starting to practice it. Regardless of everything, he was a peak Martial King cultivator. His Qi stance was fierce and firm, but he paused for awhile in three places in between. But then he still pulled through it and repeated another round. His movements became very smooth in the next round. There weren’t a lot of styles in the Back Connecting Fist and Qing Shui had demonstrated about ten rounds from beginning to end.</p>
 <p>Hu Yanlin repeatedly practiced it for fifteen rounds. He had to surpass Qing Shui’s count as a form of respect to him.</p>
 <p>During his final few rounds, Qing Shui would guide him from time to time and tell him when to exert force, the important points and also some things he had to pay attention to in the meridians.</p>
 <p>After about twenty rounds, Hu Yanlin was able to feel the benefits of this Back Connecting Fist clearly. The energy and bones in his body had gained some subtle changes to them.</p>
 <p>This was the effect of tempering the body and bones and it was surprisingly good. Hu Yanlin, who had stopped, gratefully threw a glance at Qing Shui, but he didn’t say anything to express his gratitude again. Gratitude didn’t have to be expressed in words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t teach him the Taichi fist. He felt that the violent Back Connecting Fist was more suitable for his body and bones instead of the soft and suppressed Taichi Fists. Now, it seemed like the effect was especially good.</p>
 <p>“Come here tomorrow morning. I’m going to teach you something else.” Qing Shui was planning to teach him The Tiger Form and hammer techniques. He was planning to develop and promote his Tiger Form, so as long as anyone whom he knew was interested to learn, Qing Shui would teach them.</p>
 <p>“Mister Qing, there are no words to express my gratitude,” Hu Yanlin said earnestly.</p>
 <p>“We’re going to eat, are you coming?” Qing Shui smiled, as he looked at the sky.</p>
 <p>“I wish to familiarize myself with this Back Connecting Fist. I’m a slow-witted person. I should strike when the iron’s hot, so I’d like to excuse myself Mister Qing.” Hu Yanlin scratched his head and bowed towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. You can come ask me if there’s anything you don’t understand.”</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Hu Yanlin started to cultivate once again after Qing Shui and Lady Duanmu left and was even more hardworking than just now.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang watched the scene from somewhere slightly further and was very happy. She wished for her man to become stronger. Yet at the same time, she was also worried that her man would change after he got stronger. But she laughed when she recalled Hu Yanlin’s personality. She knew that he would never change in that aspect.</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>It was already afternoon when they were done with their meal.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m bringing you to explore Duanmu City!” Lady Duanmu told Qing Shui with a smile after the servants had cleared away dishes on the dining table.</p>
 <p>“Sure!” Qing Shui replied happily. Duanmu Lingshuang had excused herself earlier because she had to settle her child. Children of big clans usually had a specialized nanny, but Duanmu Lingshuang insisted on looking after her own child.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui thought about it, it seemed like his women were all taking care of their children personally too. The Qing Clan could also be considered as a big clan…… or at least they could afford to hire a nanny.</p>
 <p>Duanmu City!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had visited here in a hurry a few times. At least he could finally take a good look around here for the first time today. The street that was not far from the Duanmu Residence was the most flourishing street in the Duanmu City. It was even wider than the main roads.</p>
 <p>There were carriages passing through this street, although they were mostly lavish carriages. Countless manors and commercial buildings lined on either side of the road. There were all kinds of people walking on the road - traders, cultivators, peddlers and commoners, as well as sons from the rich clans.</p>
 <p>Looking at the mature and graceful woman by his side, his heart was very tranquil. He had never thought that this day would come and he also didn’t know what would happen between them in the future.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt kind of relaxed and pleasant when he was watching everything around him. It was as if he didn’t have to worry about a single thing here. Nothing here seemed to affect him.</p>
 <p>“There’s always so many humans here. They have their own social circles and are always busy with their own stuff. But in the end, what is all that for?” Qing Shui expressed in amazement, as he was slowly walking around with Lady Duanmu.</p>
 <p>“Everyone has their own mission. They are constantly on the move to accomplish their missions. Aren’t you doing the same too?” Lady Duanmu replied softly after thinking for a moment without looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Indeed it is for a mission. What’s your mission then, Ruyan? Do you mind telling me?” Qing Shui smiled while staring at the beautiful outline of Lady Duanmu’s face.</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu quivered again. This was the second time Qing Shui had called her by her name. She grew silent for a moment before she lightly sighed. “To let Lingshuang live happily without any worries.”</p>
 <p>“That’s a given. Anything else?” Qing Shui was still smiling and looking at the side of her face.</p>
 <p>“That’s all!” Lady Duanmu turned her head around and gave him a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was dazed by her smile in that exact moment. It was so beautiful, just like a flower blossoming all of a sudden. It was stunningly beautiful.</p>
 <p>When he lifted his head again, Lady Duanmu was already watching him from two steps away. Her smiling face was indescribably beautiful and breathtaking at this very moment. That elegant smile was so charming that it was bone-deep.</p>
 <p>“Ruyan….”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you said that you won’t force me,” Lady Duanmu gently interrupted Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Of course I won’t.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Come, let’s go over there!” Lady Duanmu said cheerfully instead when she saw Qing Shui smiling wryly.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was about to catch up to Lady Duanmu, he realized that she had stopped. Turned out that there were three people watching them from a distance up ahead.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui saw the three of them, he knew that there was something to be taken care of today. But he was a little puzzled. Was it another coincidence?</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>There were a youth and two old men up ahead. Qing Shui frowned when he saw his opponents’ strengths. Such strong cultivators existed in Duanmu City.</p>
 <p>Peak Martial Saint cultivators!</p>
 <p>Of course, that was referring to the two elderly men at the back.</p>
 <p>The last time Madam Duanmu left, her strength was about 5,000 countries. Now, she was also a peak Martial Saint cultivator. It should be just a short while after she broke through. Her strength now was a little more than one star. One of the two elderly men had the strength of more than three stars, while the other was more than four stars.</p>
 <p>Since when did Duanmu City have such powerful figures? But when he thought about it again, it had been a very long time since he left here. Lady Duanmu’s strength had already doubled, so naturally it shouldn’t be a surprise that some powerful figures had emerged.</p>
 <p>Why did Qing Shui have a feeling that they didn’t seem to have come with good intentions?</p>
 <p>“They are from Lei Clan, who have just moved into Duanmu City a few years ago. Don’t offend them because the Lei Clan is very powerful,” Lady Duanmu warned Qing Shui softly.</p>
 <p>“Lady Duanmu, what a coincidence!” That youth came over and immediately scanned Qing Shui</p>
 <p>“Good day, Young Master Lei!” Lady Duanmu greeted slowly. It was impossible for one to tell if she was being intimate or cold. This was just how she had always been.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was staring at that youth because the eyes of this fellow with a mediocre strength had never once left Lady Duanmu’s chest. Qing Shui’s hands slowly curled up into fists.</p>
 <p>“Madam, have you made up your mind? Can we both possess the Jade Dragon Mountain? Madam, you should provide me a letter.” The youth looked at Lady Duanmu, as though he could definitely devour her.</p>
