 <p><strong>AST 995 - Entering the Sacred Land of Panacea, Legend of the Heartmatched Fruit, Six Hundred Li&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui got a little emotional thinking about it. He didn’t know why he got emotional either. Perhaps, gaining the strength of 5,000 stars had stirred up his emotions. Soon he realized that it was the anticipation of battle.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now had the strength of the Violet Star Thunder God that had over 5,000 stars in strength, close to 6,000 stars. Using the Big Dipper Sword, his strength could reach up to 4,000 stars and there was even a 20% chance of doubling an attack. That was indeed an attack of 8,000 stars and the 20% chance was not little at all.</p>
 <p>The Big Dipper Sword had been tempered again and was much stronger than before. However, the Seven Star Armored Vest from before was now gone. Even without the Seven Star Armored Vest, the Big Dipper Sword was definitely still an extremely powerful weapon.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui felt that if he entered the Sacred Land of Panacea and met a demonic beast with the strength of over 5,000 stars, he would definitely have to battle it. Perhaps, there would be an unexpected surprise from it.</p>
 <p>At the very least, he would be able to increase his fighting strength a little. Actual combat could help stabilize his strength even more, especially the battles that surpassed his limits. With that, he began thinking of Ji Yunlang, who was able to enter five hundred li deep.</p>
 <p>His progress in searching was very slow. However, it was dangerous inside, being that he was not strong enough.</p>
 <p>This led Qing Shui to think of Mu Qing’s ten Treasure Hunting Pig, the spirituality of those little ones was really a treasure. If he had one now, he probably would have gained quite a number of treasures.</p>
 <p>“Look at this, the seal has moved!”</p>
 <p>“It really moved, it’s opening!”</p>
 <p>“We are able to get in at last.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui snapped himself back to reality The fluctuations of the halo before him resembled a wave, it looked like 1,000 layers of wave. At the same time, it looked like a ripple that was constantly prolonged. In the end, it turned into something like a transparent band-aid.</p>
 <p>“We can go in now. Qing Shui, let’s go in!” Ji Yunlang smiled and said to Qing Shui</p>
 <p>“Good, let’s go in together and open up a pathway for them,” Qing Shui said as he passed the green jade to Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Ji Yunlang were the first to set foot inside. Qing Shui had set up the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation at the opening of the cave. Thus, he was not worried about anyone coming in to steal or people who held other intentions.</p>
 <p>This transparent door was about about ten meters wide and circular in shape. Qing Shui had told them to stop for a little while. Looking in from the outside, there was nothing dangerous about it. With the fine sunny weather, it looked really beautiful, the vegetation and the grass with some little birds …...</p>
 <p>Upon entering, Qing Shui felt the vast Spiritual Qi. There was a nice smell which had an indescribable, particularly relaxing quality. The air in the World of the Nine Continents had Spiritual Qi that Qing Shui was already very satisfied with. After all, the environment of his previous life and the World of the Nine Continents wa smiles apart. However, Qing Shui felt like he is in the wonderland of the human realm.</p>
 <p>Feeling that the surroundings beneath him had not change at all, Qing Shui felt his body frantically absorbing the Spiritual Qi around him, as though he was a sponge that was placed in water.</p>
 <p>He called out to the others outside, and all of them came inside quickly. Ji Yunlang talked to them for a while before turning to a few from Ji clan. “All of you can take a stroll here, but be mindful and do not go beyond the ten miles mark.”</p>
 <p>A few from Ji clan had already spread out, while some of them stayed close, not walking further.</p>
 <p>“Zhu Qing, stay here with your elder sister and the few of them. Do not go anywhere else. Just rest here for a day.” Qing Shui smiled while taking out a few chairs, aside table and a couch. He even placed down a few fruits to eat. After that, Qing Yu stopped harassing them</p>
 <p>Qingqing and Zhu Qing nodded happily. Guo Polu laughed as he was satisfied with just watching Qingqing.</p>
 <p>“Brother in law, stay here and train your martial skills, practice a little and look after them at the same time.” Qing Shui didn't want him to take risks.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I shall remain here to practice!” Guo Polu laughed.</p>
 <p>The others from Qing Clan were not allowed to go further than ten li. Even though there would be greater chances of better finding treasures beyond the ten li mark, Qing Shui did not want them to risk it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let all of his demonic beasts out since this was a rare opportunity which could allow them to grow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and his demonic beasts could communicate mentally, so he told them not to go too far. He told the Five-Headed Demonic Spider to look after this place. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider had the highest Spiritual Intelligence. However, as far as Qing Shui knew, it had the voice of a little girl.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui arranged a giant Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation, telling them that if they happened to have any mishaps, they should enter the Formation or run out immediately. Although he knew that the chances of this happening was low, Qing Shui still left a way for them to escape. After all, he was not to familiar with this place.</p>
 <p>This was why Qing Shui left all of his demonic beasts here.</p>
 <p>After doing all of that, Qing Shui started his journey. Others had already begun to search the nearby areas. Generally, a few of them were grouped together and there was even an especially big group of them. After all, they were a clan.</p>
 <p>Ji Yunlang had left already. The previous time, his group was able to enter 500 li deep and he believed he would able to enter there this time as well. Generally, the deeper you went, the better the items. However, as a matter of course, the deeper you went, the more dangerous it was.</p>
 <p>Humans die in pursuit of wealth, just as birds will die for food. Benefits and risks were directly proportional. To gain a greater amount of benefit, one had to take a greater risk, it could even lead to losing their lives.</p>
 <p>Armed with the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui could hit over 5,000 stars in strength. The most important thing was that while using the Big Dipper Sword, his speed would be much quicker.</p>
 <p>Having prepared the Heavenly Talisman, Gale Pellet and the Agility Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui expanded his spiritual sense. With that done, he then headed towards the abyss.</p>
 <p>Standing in the sky, Qing Shui noticed that he was unable to see the end of this world with a glance. Qing Shui could not seem to understand where this sealed place was. This should still be the Main Continent, just that it had been separated.</p>
 <p>500 li… Qing Shui thought about Ji Yunlang entering 500 li deep. He should have ran into some strong Demonic Beasts. Furthermore, they should have abilities of more than 5000 stars. However, there should not be too many of them, or else, he would not have been able to return.</p>
 <p>Stretching out with his spiritual sense, Qing Shui went in deeper. This place had a lot of great treasure and was definitely not short of them. Moreover, those who were able to get in here would have mostly searched within ten li or a 100 li.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Qing Shui reached a distance of ten li. Upon reaching this area, he immediately noticed aura that was different from before. There were dangerous demonic beasts in the area, but they were not a threat to him.</p>
 <p>100 li!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s speed was fast, he only had a day’s time and he did not want to waste any time in this area. He wanted to use his abilities to its limit or go further to search.</p>
 <p>300 li!</p>
 <p>In less than an hour, Qing Shui had surprisingly advanced 300 li. The aura was more or less the same now as the previous 100 miles. His sharp spiritual sense allowed him to know that there was no danger.</p>
 <p>What!</p>
 <p>Heartmatched Fruit!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked dumbfoundedly at a little red tree not far away. This tree was a meter tall and had two flaming red fruits that were heart shaped. These fruits were about the size of a fist and were brightly colored and glistened.</p>
 <p>“There really is such a thing, there really is such a thing?” Qing Shui stared blankly for a long time.</p>
 <p>The Heartmatched Fruit was a fruit from legends, it was only recorded in history books. Legend said that the fruit could lead a man and a woman who were previously unattracted to each other to fall in love and even tie the knot. It was said that this fruit would work even if the two hated each other.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was just a legend. However, the Heartmatched Fruit Tree before him looked identical to the one recorded in history books. A Heartmatched Fruit would not increase strength but it could last for ten years. In history, it was said that the Heartmatched Fruit could be eaten alone. Only if two people eating the same Heartmatched Fruit from the same Heartmatched Fruit Tree then would tie the knot and like each other.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated for a moment before he knocked the Heartmatched Fruit down to store in the metal box</p>
 <p>He did not transplant the entire Heartmatched Fruit Tree. That was because a Heartmatched Fruit Tree could only bear two Heartmatched Fruits. Qing Shui then left quickly, heading deeper inside.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>400 li in, Qing Shui met a strong demonic beast, the Three-Horned Fire Bull.</p>
 <p>It was a huge fiery ox that grew three horns , its height was about 30 meters and its length was about 100 meters. It looked like a small mountain with a flaming red body that flashed with a crimson blaze, giving off a berserk aura.</p>
 <p>3,500 stars of strength!</p>
 <p>As soon as the Three-Horned Fire Bull saw Qing Shui, its entire body arched towards the sky, letting out a tremendous howl. After he came to the World of the Nine Continents, he knew that the howl of an ox would not be inferior to that of a tiger. Or at least, the roars of the tigers that he had heard were all incomparable to the howl of this Three-Horned Fire Bull.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wished to engage in battle as seeking treasure was his main purpose. He raised his strength to its peak and he jumped.</p>
 <p>Sword of Sixth Wave!</p>
 <p>Bang Bang …...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then stared blankly at the Three-Horned Fire Bull that had exploded into a pile of mud.</p>
 <p>The Sword of Sixth Wave have stacked with the 20% chance of doubling the attack. Striking out with the strength of 8,000 stars while using the Sword of Sixth Wave, it was only normal that an ox with the strength of 3,500 stars would have exploded like this.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui felt that it was a bit of a pity. He had wanted to keep some fur and the ox’s core. After all, it was a demonic beast with the strength of 3,500 stars.</p>
 <p>Only Qing Shui was here. If Ji Yunlang was here too, he would definitely be startled to the point that his eyeballs would pop out. To be able to explode the Three-Horned Fire Bull into dregs in one strike, what kind of strength was it? The defense of the Three-Horned Fire Bull is very strong.</p>
 <p>500 li!</p>
 <p>As soon as he entered this area, Qing Shui felt a dangerous aura. However, he still believed that he would be able to handle it. Being in here, Qing Shui would not advance forward blindly since he felt that this area could be considered as a dangerous zone.</p>
 <p>Within ten li, it would still be a safe zone. In fact, it should still be a relatively safe zone within ten to 100 miles. A 100 to 500 li would be another stage and he could possibly meet another strong demonic beast similar to that Three-Horned Fire Bull from before.</p>
 <p>Beyond 500 li should be considered as an extremely dangerous zone. Since he only had a day’s time, this sacred land should not be that big or there would be another exit on the other side, just like the sealed opening. Qing Shui guessed that there would be several exits in this area.</p>
 <p>Golden-Back Giant Crocodile Emperor!</p>
 <p>At close to 600 li, Qing Shui could see a circular lake. It measured 20 li from north to south and about 30 li from east to west. As soon as Qing Shui reached the lakeside, he saw a huge crocodile swimming in the water.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had seen the Golden-Back Giant Crocodile Emperor in the Archive of Demonic Beast, the strength of it was unclear, but it was definitely a king in shallow sea waters of the lake.</p>
 <p>6,000 stars!</p>
 <p>With a beast that had a strength of 6,000 stars, it was no wonder that Ji Yunlang had warned Qing Shui not to go too deep. He had to be very careful as he was only at the 600 li mark yet there was actually such a strong demonic beast.</p>
 <p>The Golden-Back Giant Crocodile Emperor was 200 meters long, its back was a golden color whereas the other parts was black. Emerging from the lake, its long body looked made it look like a gold jiao dragon.</p>
