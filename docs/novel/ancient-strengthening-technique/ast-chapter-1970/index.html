 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a few days, Qing Shui arrived at the Sacred Mountain. There was no need to deny that this place was very comfortable. Its Spiritual Qi was so abundant compared to many places. It was said that the Spiritual Qi here originated from the Sacred Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a few years since he last visited this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt very weird. He personally had a deep impression of Sheng Jun. In fact, it couldn’t be forgotten by the time. The feeling was so strong and deep down, even he felt like meeting her. Certainly, this came from the fact that they were friends. He never really harbored any intentions more than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui proceeded his way towards the peak of Sacred Mountain which he was familiar with. After being stopped by some people, he was informed that Sheng Jun wasn’t on Sacred Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since she wasn’t around, Qing Shui stopped going up and immediately flew in the direction of Vampiric Demoness Hills</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he entered the Vampiric Demoness Hills, the first thing he ran into were two Vampiric Demonesses. They were totally naked. The Vampiric Demonesses looked beautiful and had pale skin across their body. However, to Qing Shui, their pair of wings sort of ruined their entire look. Their wings didn’t make them looked like angels, instead, it helped to cover up some of their butts. At the moment they saw Qing Shui, they ran away very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought that he scared them away with his aura. But actually, it was due to the Vampiric Empress’ aura. He and the Vampiric Empress had already become husband and wife. In this case, his body also emitted the aura of the Vampiric Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui managed to walk into the valley-like place without any obstructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no guards here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Multiple enormous trees were connected together. Similarly, the houses on top of it were also joined together. After that, Qing Shui looked in a direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a corridor in between these trees, a little girl could be seen running and hopping along. She couldn’t be considered quick, yet she transmitted a very strange rhythm with her movements. Her hair looked very messy, still it was untainted by even a speck of dust. She had an exquisite face and her black eyes looked bright like crystals. They seemed very lively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl wasn’t noticing Qing Shui until she ran closer to him. After that, she curiously looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed a smile on his face as he squatted down, “Little brat, tell me your name.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The little brat rolled her eyes and immediately turned around and ran away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She ran and screamed, “Mother, there is a bad guy around here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knitted his brows. To think that this little brat would already be so crafty despite her age. On his first look at the little girl, he initially thought that she would be a well-behaved child. Who would have expected that she suddenly became so mischievous like a little demon? It was a good thing that she looked as beautiful as a doll.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a Sacred Demoness. From here, he could already figure out that she was his own daughter. The Sacred Demoness, Qing Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little brat still had a baby voice, yet it sounded very sharp. At just an instant, multiple Vampiric Demonesses already appeared. The Vampiric Demonesses who could be here were all higher level Vampiric Demonesses. The Vampiric Empress also showed up; she was stunned upon seeing Qing Shui. Soon after, she waved her hand and ordered the others to do their own things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress carried up her daughter who ran to her side and smiled as she approached Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went forward and put his arms around her waist, “Why do I have a feeling that you have become unfamiliar with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Qing Xuan had her head up as she looked at the so-called ‘bad person’. Now that the Vampiric Empress was here, she didn’t fear Qing Shui. She even made a wry face to him in an attempt to scare him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I miss you, I really, really miss you!” whispered the Vampiric Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me too! A lot!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brat, say daddy! He is your father!” The Vampiric Empress smiled as she looked at the little brat. At this moment, her face was filled with a joyful smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smile came from deep within her heart. The little brat, on the other hand, curiously looked at Qing Shui before moving her sight onto the Vampiric Empress, “Mommy, what is a daddy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress smiled and rubbed Qing Xuan’s head, “He is another person who is the closest to you just like your mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little brat seemed to understand, but at the same time, also didn’t understand what she meant. Nevertheless, she still listened and called out to Qing Shui, “Daddy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hands and took over Qing Xuan. The little brat didn’t reject him. Maybe it was due to the factors that they shared the same bloodline, or maybe it was also because of the natural aura which was emitted across Qing Shui’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, you are my daughter. I will make sure you and your mother become the happiest people in the world. Does that sound ok with you?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xuan already understood a thing or two about the world. The children here tended to mature up quite early. If it had been in his previous incarnation, she would have been studying in a kindergarten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had one of his arm carrying Qing Xuan and the other holding the Vampiric Empress’ hand as they walked towards the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at his extremely beautiful daughter by his side, deep down, Qing Shui felt at peace. Back then, never did he expect for the final woman in the Portraits of Beauty to be her, nor had it once crossed his mind that they would end up like how they were now. Whenever Qing Shui looked at her, she would also look back at Qing Shui. At the moment when their eyes met, she could be seen feeling a bit shy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s heart was also beating very fast. He tightened his grip on her hand slightly. If it wasn’t because of his daughter, by now, he would have…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They arrived at a place where there was no one else. Qing Shui let both her and his daughter took the Opportunity Pill. As for helping the Vampiric Empress raised her strength, he could only do it once his daughter was asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the Vampiric Empress was like a predestined thing. It was a kind of heritage for the king, the heritage of the Vampiric Tribe. Not only so, but she was also a woman on the Portraits of Beauty. She possessed a matchless talent and her strength had now achieved the early stage of the Seventh level of Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t too surprised with her strength. After all, she was an empress. The Vampiric Demoness Tribe could also be considered as a powerful tribe. For an empress, an existence which surpassed that of a queen, it went without saying that she would possess fearsome strength.</span></p>

Maybe because of her bloodline, a Golden Pellet immediately formed within the Vampiric Empress’ body.</span></p>

But later on, it turned into a Paragon Vessel.</span></p>

This was a kind of Golden Pellet formed when one’s strength converged up to a certain extent. Across the continent, even if there were many Divine Grade Warriors, their Dantian would still only compose of a lump of qi. It was unlikely for it to be rock solid. However, there were certain cases where some warriors would have it in liquid or solid form. For warriors with a solid Dantian, it would still be a very, very challenging thing for them to condense it into a Golden Pellet.</span></p>

Those were one of her most powerful abilities as Vampiric Tribe. Her attacks were also very sharp, they were very penetrative and could deal the deepest wounds to her opponents. The ability to make her opponents bleed were equally fearsome. It was capable of suppressing the opponent’s ability to self-recover. Its only drawback was that it consumed a lot of energy.</span></p>

This was also the reason why he kept it. It could be used efficiently with a sword and he specifically prepared it for the Vampiric Empress to equip. This thing could be considered as the Vampiric Empress’ Divine Artifact. Qing Shui could help her build an even stronger foundation with it. Most importantly, since she already formed her Golden Pellet, Qing Shui had the ability to raise the capacity of the Golden Pellet. Instead of raising her strength, this was more like an ability to raise her endurance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xuan’s innate talent raised by about two times. The little brat was initially born with an outstanding innate talent. Now, it could even be considered as her most precious asset. In the future, her achievements wouldn’t be inferior to Luan Luan’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out the jade pendant which he refined himself and gave it to the little brat. Though it was not really useful now, it was still a symbol of his love as a father. Not only so, but Qing Shui also left behind quite a few medicinal pills for the Vampiric Empress. He prepared it on purpose for her and his daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After thinking for a bit, Qing Shui took out a bracelet and put it on the Vampiric Empress’ hands. Other than looking good, it was also an interspatial treasure. In comparison to the Interspatial Silk Sachet, this one had a significantly larger capacity. The Vampiric Empress blushed as she looked at the man putting on the bracelet for her. At that instant, she felt a sense of comfort which words couldn’t describe. This was love, or rather, familial love. He was the most important man in her life. The fact that she, her daughter and he could be together, particularly when she saw her daughter’s surprised look, she couldn’t have felt even more satisfied in her entire life. She was very happy. Moreover, his eyes when looking at her were also filled with satisfaction and love.</span></p>

Slowly, he put his arms deep into her lower body. The smooth and exquisite feeling of their skin touching was followed by the soul-taking feeling as Qing Shui entered her body. It made the Vampiric Empress tremble. At this moment, her vision had become a bit blurry and her face looked very red, all because she had reached her climax a few times. Her satisfied expression gave Qing Shui a sense of pride as a man.</span></p>
