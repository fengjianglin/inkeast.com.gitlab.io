You look deep in thought." A soft voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui naturally knew that someone had gotten close. He turned and smiled at Yuan Su. She was well-known, a beautiful miraculous physician from the Imperial Cuisine Hall who had managed to earn a great reputation in the whole Dancing Phoenix Continent. She had amazing medical skills and a powerful alchemy ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman also had a beauty which wouldn't lose out to any of the ladies on the Portraits of Beauty, she was also meticulous and intelligent. When Qing Shui looked at her, she was also looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm thinking about our Beauty Su." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The relationship between Qing Shui and Yuan Su had always been very ambiguous. The two of them could casually hug and kiss, but that was it. They didn't have any further progress. They were like intimate friends, sharing everything under the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su took the initiative and went up to wrap her hands around Qing Shui's neck, "I've missed you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then let's go back to the room and discuss the formation of life." Qing Shui looked at Yuan Su's exquisite face. Her big and beautiful eyes appeared bright and intelligent, occasionally exuding hints of charm. Her upright nose was like white jade, appearing to have a hint of gracefulness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What attracted Qing Shui the most was her sexy lips which were of the right thickness, and with a slightly bright color. The natural slight upward curve brought an indescribable sense of seduction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're getting from bad to worse!" Yuan Su chided Qing Shui charmingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned by her charm and then put his head forward to kiss that sexy little lips greedily. The taste of sweetness filled up his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su shuddered as an intense gush of manly aura surged in her way. A pair of strong arms wrapped around her, as the result, her heart was beating very fast. She didn't know when it started, but she had started to think about this feeling, this man, and of how she wanted to be bullied by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She answered Qing Shui's kisses clumsily and it was also the first time she took the initiative to reach her little tongue into Qing Shui's mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's hands weren't slacking either, they skillfully found their ways to her peaks, massaging them relentlessly into different shapes. Yuan Su's soft moans made Qing Shui wild and he would ask more and more from Yuan Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was until he was thinking of doing her on the spot that Yuan Su pushed Qing Shui away, her face flushed red. Earlier on, Qing Shui had already let her reached an orgasm with his hands. Although Yuan Su was a mature woman who valued her chastity, she still had her needs. Therefore, Qing Shui would still let her have her release whenever the opportunity arose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Yuan Su was feeling both comfortable and uncomfortable. At that moment, it felt so comfortable as if her soul was going to leave her body. However, her lower body was now a little wet. Thus, it became an uncomfortable feeling</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, her pair of misty eyes was looking at Qing Shui shyly. She then wrapped her hands around Qing Shui's neck again. "I'll wait for you in my room tonight. I'll leave the door unlocked for you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, she kissed Qing Shui on the cheek and quickly left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at that beautiful figure leaving rapidly, Qing Shui only regained his senses after very long. Has this lass already thought things through?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui actually knew that Yuan Su would definitely become his woman one day. After all, although they hadn't made it to the last base, they were already very intimate. Her hands had already touched all over his body. Moreover, she had also stayed in the Qing Clan's Imperial Cuisine Hall for many years. Why would she do that if it wasn't for Qing Shui? Why would she remain single all this time if it wasn't for Qing Shui? With her prospects, she could find any kind of man she wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan came as well. So did Qing Sha. Qing Sha was also considered as Qing Shui's goddaughter and disciple. This wasn't the first time that Qing Sha had come. Moreover, the Qing Clan was also very friendly to this pitiful girl. All of them treated her as Qing Shui's daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eldest Prince Yu Sunu had come back as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was now very lively in the Qing Clan and Qing Shui was also very busy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yi looked at her son. This young man was really very fortunate. However, his had too much affinity with women. Qing Yi had no idea how many women he had, but each of them were great beauties. It would already be a great fortune for the Qing Clan to possess one of them, let alone tens of them. They had enough fortune to thank their ancestors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mother, why are you looking at me like that?" Qing Shui went up to massage Qing Yi's shoulder. Qing Shui had good massage skill and it should feel very good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the main hall, Qing Shui headed to his mother's place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I only find it strange. Who does this amorous lad take after? Your father isn't like this." Qing Yi sighed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why do I have the feeling that Mother doesn't like that I have wives?" Qing Shui smiled and said. Right now, even Qing Yi knew the word that Qing Shui said was referring to 'wife' [1].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Rubbish. I'd want you to bring back all the good women in the world and marry them." Qing Yi closed her eyes and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, "I'll work hard."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yi was rendered speechless. "Qing Shui, treat them well. All of them are very outstanding, yet they love you so much. Don't make them sad."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, your son knows."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That night, when Qing Shui entered Yuan Su's room, it was already the latter half of the night. This woman was in her nightgown and leaning against the bed. Under the light stone, her sluggish expression was very calm. After Qing Shui entered, her face turned red and then her heartbeat became very fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui closed the door and then sat down next to Yuan Su. He could sense Yuan Su's heartbeat and knew that she was feeling very nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You aren't ready yet." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've already made up my mind, but I'm still very nervous." Yuan Su leaned in Qing Shui's embrace and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's hand slithered along her back and then brought her up to get her to sit on him. Both of them were now wearing thin clothes and Qing Shui's natural reaction could be clearly felt by Yuan Su. It was impossible to not feel such an apparent thing against her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su was like an ostrich, burying her head into Qing Shui's embrace.
