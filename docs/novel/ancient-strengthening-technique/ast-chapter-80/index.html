 <p><strong>Chapter 80 Kissing Yu He.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0080 – Kissing Yu He</strong></p>
  <p><span style>The majority of the topics of conversation between Qing Shui and Baili Jingwei were started by Qing Shui, while Baili Jingwei answered him. In this short period of time, Qing Shui had broadened his knowledge, and came to understand many things, such as famous landmarks and the strong sects and family clans from the Cang Lang country. For example: the Heavenly Sword Sect, Incense Valley, Joyful Sect and Giant Sword Sect…</span></p>
  <p><span style>While this was occurring, Baili Wufeng, from the start till the finish, remained silent. Qing Shui could tell that the personality of Wufeng was extremely proud, and was a person of few words. He had no intention of provoking Wufeng.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before the grandfather and grandson duo left, Wufeng turned back, and looked at Qing Shui as he stated, “I will be sure to look for you in the future.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could only wryly smile as they left, and stored the Cloudflame Cylinder into his spatial realm before ascending the stairs.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Knock knock knock!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui extended his hand and rapped on the door of Yu He, before pushing the door open and walking in. He discovered that Yu He was standing by the window, and as he walked to her side he noticed the posture of Yu He, and Qing Shui could not help but feel attracted to Yu He. That graceful figure of hers, unintentionally emitted a feminine air, causing Qing Shui to be mesmerized.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Speaking of femininity, Qing Shui thought back to the explanations from his previous world. Femininity, can be just a gentle look, a graceful posture, or laughter sparkling in the eyes, a caring gesture, or even a bashful reaction. These actions would all emit the air of femininity!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just as Qing Shui was reminiscing about memories from his previous world, Yu He suddenly spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you an acquaintance of that old man?” Yu He curiously asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I did not know who he was before today. Is there a problem? Or does sister Yu know about Baili Jingwei?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Everytime Qing Shui called out the words ‘sister Yu’, he felt as if a knife was stabbing right in his heart, as he sighed ruefully in his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Baili Jingwei? You said that old man’s name is Baili Jingwei?” The pupils of Yu He widened as she exclaimed in shock.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at her questioningly as suspicion filled his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the bewildered expression on Qing Shui face, she knew that he was waiting for her explanation. Fluttering her beautiful eyelashes, she replied “I’m not very sure as well, but I once heard that the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sword Sect from the Cang Lang country was named Baili Jingwei, but I don’t know if that person earlier was him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Heavenly Sword Sect! Qing Shui gasped in surprise. Earlier, he had learned from Baili Jingwei that the authority behind the Cang Lang Country, was in the hands of the Heavenly Sword Sect, and not only that, the Heavenly Sword Sect was the biggest sect in all of the 81 cities which belonged to the Greencloud Continent!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Pausing to ruminate on the facts he just discovered, Qing Shui realized that what Yu He had said was probably true, and that old man earlier might have been the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sword Sect. Despite his damaged Dantian and energy channels, the pressure he emitted was countless times more domineering than that of Wenren Wu-Shuang. If his Dantian was not injured……</span></p>
  <p><span style>“From the looks of the old man earlier, it seems highly possible. It matches the rumors that his looks are of a kindly old man, with foresight and intelligence. It is said that he has connections with many people of authority, and his ability in gauging the ability of others are extremely accurate.” Yu He replied thoughtfully.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The words of Yu He caused Qing Shui to think back the words Baili Jingwei said to him. Could it be that Qing Shui could really become a hegemon of this world? Qing Shui had no confidence, he couldn’t even break through to the 4th layer after 6 years, was Baili Jingwei mistaken?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sister Yu, how’s the strength of the Heavenly Sword Sect?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He did not know about matters such as these. She assumed a natural position as she reclined on the sofa, one of her legs gracefully resting on top of the other. The graceful movement of her legs added a slight essence of a maturity, and emitted an irresistible charm. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the dazed look in Qing Shui’s eyes, Yu He slightly knit her brows. Qing Shui hurriedly shifted his gaze away, embarrassed. “I didn’t have other intentions. It’s just that you are too beautiful, and full of elegance, so I couldn’t bear it anymore.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He speechless, glanced at Qing Shui from the corner of her eyes. This little brat was full of weird ideas, but all his words were so sweet and pleasing to her ears. “What? What do you mean you couldn’t bear it anymore.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s like when you are eating the black fish, but you are only allowed to look, but not eat. It’s that type of unbearable feeling.” Qing Shui seriously explained.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why won’t you allow me to eat.” Qing Shui sheepishly added.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He went red, as her eyes widened, “You still want to eat me? Go to hell!” Maybe it was because of Qing Shui taking advantage of her in the past, but the words of Qing Shui caused Yu He to lunge towards him in anger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was dumbstruck, and unconsciously mirrored her movements. Qing Shui stepped forwards and hugged Yu He in his embrace.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although it was winter, the room was as warm as spring. Yu He was wearing an extremely flimsy robe, and when her body was pressed against Qing Shui, he could clearly feel the warmth emanating from her body. That feeling, caused his heartbeat to quicken as he was especially agitated.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Both of his hands were placed upon Yu He’s slender waist, and his lips naturally sought out the lips of Yu He as he gently kissed them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He was thoroughly dumbfounded, and she unintentionally opened her mouth wider, gasping in surprise.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had no idea what he was doing, and continued kissing. Using his tongue to explore the lips and tongue of Yu He, while he strengthened his grip, and pressing Yu He closer and closer into his embrace.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wu Wu!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>An unknown amount of time passed, before the two of them broke apart!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Cough cough!” Yu He was almost breathless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you trying to suffocate me to death!” Yu He’s face was extremely red, and those rosy lips of hers were slightly swollen due to the kissing earlier, and looked even sexier when compared to earlier. Unsated, Qing Shui leaned his mouth forward again…</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You brat, release me!” Yu He prettily pouted, in embarrassment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui nervously retracted his hands, which was still on the slender waist of Yu He… Just as Qing Shui released his hold, he could not help but think back on earlier, that exquisite and soft texture of her lips which were filled with fragrance. As he raised his head, he saw the complicated look in Yu He’s eyes.</span></p>
  <p><i><span style>What is happening to me? I keep allowing this little brat to take advantage of me, and he grows increasingly bolder. But what did the kiss earlier mean? Why did I not struggle? We can’t go on like this, things will only get worse.</span></i><span style> All these thoughts rapidly flashed through her mind as Yu He panicked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m sorry, I like you, I really like you a lot!”</span></p>
