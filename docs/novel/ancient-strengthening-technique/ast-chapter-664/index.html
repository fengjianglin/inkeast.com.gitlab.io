 <p><strong>AST 664 - Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death (2)</strong></p>
 <p>"Di Clan is here... Di Clan is here..."</p>
 <p>The commotion seemed to be greater due to their late arrival. Even the five old men from the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect let out a sigh of relief in their hearts. To stand in the arena and do nothing while people stared at them for a full two hours was not a pleasant feeling.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the people from the Di Clan had finally arrived, the five people on the arena felt as if they were about to cry. They had felt very uncomfortable standing there and there were too many people below. The gazes from numerous experts staring at them made them feel extremely uncomfortable. It felt as if they were demonic beasts who had been locked up in cages and were being appreciated by spectators.</p>
 <p>There was still another hour before noon. The people from Di Clan were only late, not disqualified. Moreover, under such circumstances, the Di Clan's late arrival seemed very natural. It was normal for the weaker party to be late.</p>
 <p>Only a few more than 20 people from the Di Clan came. The rest of them had been scattered but they would all rush to the Seven Stars Arena progressively. They wouldn’t be standing together but they would be split up into several batches.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu led one group, Old Master Di led another, Nian Feng’s grandfather and grandson led one, and Qianyu Dingjun led another. Silently, without anyone noticing, they would proceed near to the influential forces. This would prevent the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect from slyly using secret poison attacks.</p>
 <p>The first to arrive were Qing Shui, Di Xuan, Old Madam Mo. Additionally, there was Di Chen, Di Qing, and the Di Clan's core members led by Old Master Di.</p>
 <p>There was no one to host the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death because no one would be willing to. Even if one party gained an overwhelming victory, the victors wouldn’t be unscathed and must definitely pay a big price. Therefore, such battles tended to be self-initiated. There was no need to say anything when they were in the fight.</p>
 <p>"Why do I feel like the Di Clan aren’t here to take part in the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death? Are you guys able to tell who'll be participating?" someone asked in a puzzled tone.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Since Di Xuan is standing there in front, he should be participating. But why are there only three of them? There's even a young man amidst them." an old man came to join the talk.</p>
 <p>"You guys may not be aware, but this young man is the one who killed Sima Sha in a single blow. And he's the main player in this Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death."</p>
 <p>"The main player in the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death?"</p>
 <p>In that instant, many people crowded around. The person who had spoken earlier was soon surrounded. Everyone started to ask all sorts of questions, trying to get him to share more details.</p>
 <p>The person who had spoken was a strong young man. He wiped off the perspiration on his forehead and began to share what he had heard, which were coincidentally the truth of the matter.</p>
 <p>"This is really surprising. To think that he's one of the participants in the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death at his young age. Even the people from Di Clan would need to listen to him." many people could not help but exclaimed.</p>
 <p>"Additionally, he's also the Di Clan's proud son-in-law. If the Di Clan can get out of this predicament, I reckon they would marry both their daughters to him. Where else would they find another outstanding man like him?"</p>
 <p>"That's right. My daughter doesn't look that bad either. If she can be married to him..." a middle-aged man with a shrewd look said.</p>
 <p>"If it's your daughter, you can forget about it. He wouldn't want her even if you were to pay him. Even across the whole World of the Nine Continents, there aren't many who can rival the beauty of the Di Clan's Young Misses." someone immediately teased.</p>
 <p>"3rd Brother Bu, even if my daughter is ugly, she's still better than yours." the shrewd looking man bellowed angrily.</p>
 <p>"Although my lass is ugly, at least she's my daughter. As for other people's... that I wouldn't be so sure."</p>
 <p>"You... you... I'll fight it out with you..."</p>
 <p>The whole place became an entire mess but everything calmed down very quickly. It was because they were all here to spectate the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death. There were people who thought that they were too noisy and had thrown them out.</p>
 <p>"Granny, father, Qing Shui, you guys must be careful." Di Chen said worriedly.</p>
 <p>Old Madam Mo nodded and took a step away.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan patted Di Chen's head and smiled to assure her.</p>
 <p>Di Qing stood next to Di Xuan, grabbing onto one of his arms.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took Di Chen's hand and said, "Don't worry, just take care of yourself."</p>
 <p>After the time it took for an incense to burn had almost passed, Qing Shui and the other two stepped across the air and headed for the Seven Stars Arena.</p>
 <p>"That can't be true... The three of them are the ones in the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death?"</p>
 <p>Once Qing Shui and the other two stepped forth, someone from the crowd immediately exclaimed.</p>
 <p>"What is the Di Clan thinking about this time? Are they not have any hopes for this fight? They don't seem to be people who would resign to their fates so easily." another person also shouted.</p>
 <p>A few elder in their sixties stood a distance away. They were wearing plain white clothes, together with their white beards and hair, they seemed like celestial beings.</p>
 <p>"Brother Ying, what do you think?" an old man whose eyes were filled with intelligence smiled.</p>
 <p>"That young man?" the person addressed as Brother Ying was an elegant looking old man who seemed wise as well. He gave off a refreshing feeling like a spring breeze.</p>
 <p>"Mmm!"</p>
 <p>"To be honest, I don't know. While everything seems to be decided on the surface. Although it seems like the Di Clan has no hopes of overthrowing this fate, I feel that things are not that simple. The reason it's not that simple is because of that young man." the old man smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>"That's right. I reckon you people are thinking along the same lines. I cannot sense that young man's true level and he's exuding a powerful resistive force. He should be able to give everyone a surprise today." the old man who had spoken first looked at the other elder and said.</p>
 <p>"It'll be starting soon. Let's just all wait and see!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, Di Xuan, and Old Madam Mo were now standing on the Seven Stars Arena. Both parties hadn’t spoken a word since the challenge was set. Sometimes, battles were really absurd.</p>
 <p>"Qianxi Yong, your Qianxi Clan used underhanded means to force our Di Clan to this Seven Stars Arena. Are you satisfied now?" Di Xuan calmly looked at the white haired old man dressed in black clothes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was trying to sense his opponents' level, and the results of his probing left him quite happy. Two of them were at the Grade Ten Martial Saint level, but they were either at the same level as Old Madam Mo or only slightly stronger. Old Madam Mo had now recovered and was a Grade Ten Martial Saint expert herself.</p>
 <p>Out of the remaining three, one was a Peak Grade Nine Martial Saint, while the other two were Peak Grade Eight Martial Saints.</p>
 <p>This was within Qing Shui's expectations. After all, to their knowledge, the Di Clan didn’t have any Grade Ten Martial Saints. The enemies who knew that Qing Shui had the ability to weaken his opponent's powers had all died. Moreover, even if they had a slight inkling of an idea, they would not believe that someone’s ability could be so perverse.</p>
 <p>"Di Clan, now that things have come down to this, let's not talk about it. There is the grievance between us. Today, we'll end things here, in front of everyone in the Seven Stars Country. Let's end everything between the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect and the Di Clan." Qianxi Yong said proudly.</p>
 <p>He was forced to stand in this arena for far too long and was now very irritable.</p>
 <p>"Since you guys have chosen the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death, then our Di Clan will end everything with your Ten Thousand Poisons Sect today. Our Di Clan has never been bullied by other people, we have never been afraid of anything, and we will never bow down to evil." Di Xuan's voice was not only loud but everyone in the area could hear him. Di Clan's reputation in the Seven Stars City was still quite good.</p>
 <p>"Could it be that there's no one else left in the Di Clan, or are you looking down on our Ten Thousand Poisons Sect?" Qianxi Yong smiled and said. He didn't fly into a rage and instead tried to change the topic.</p>
 <p>"The Ten Thousand Poisons Sect is only this much. To tell the truth, we feel that there's too many of us even with just the three of us." Qing Shui smiled as he replied.</p>
 <p>This single sentence caused a thousand ripples. This line made many people momentarily fall into a stunned silence. But very quickly, a strong commotion broke out.</p>
 <p>"This young man really doesn’t know any better. To be honest, I'm surprised that you're able to stand here and say this today. It couldn’t have been easy for you to survive till now." Qianxi Yong was stunned for a short moment before he chuckled.</p>
 <p>Even the people behind him were smiling. It should have been a fight to the death, but now, there was no long an overwhelming aura. The people from Ten Thousand Poisons Sect seemed as if they were playing around.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at them, his heart was so calm that there wasn’t even a single ripple. At the very least, these few people posed no threat to him.</p>
 <p>"If everyone's ready, then let's just start!" Old Madam Mo said softly.</p>
 <p>"Fight!"</p>
 <p>"Start the fight!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The crowd exploded. They had been waiting under the hot sun for over two hours. Now that both parties had finally arrived, they felt like they were just standing there and wasting time.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then let's start!"</p>
 <p>After saying that, Qianxi Yong took the lead and leaped into the air, followed by the other four behind him. The only stopped after they've reached a thousand meters into the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the other two did the same too.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui and the others rose up, a commotion broke out under the Seven Stars Arena. Those who were at the Martial Saint level stepped in the air to view the fight from a distance, while those with flying beasts rode them into the air. Everyone would look from a distance and not soar as high as those in the battle.</p>
 <p>However, most of the people continued to watch from the ground. Because the distance was too far, they could not see them that clearly. Those who were weaker could only listen to the others telling them what was happening or wait for a corpse to drop.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the other two kept a distance of 100 meters from their opponents. They were all on their guards, weapons readied. No matter how relaxed they seemed to be earlier, this was after all, a battle to the death. Most importantly, they could already start attacking now.</p>
 <p>The Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death had already started from the moment they flew 500 meters above the ground.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, Di Xuan, and Old Madam Mo exchanged a glanced before they took a gradual step forward. This step seemed to cause the air in the surroundings to tremble.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's aura scattered out in that moment. Even the opponents’ countenances turned grim when Qing Shui's expression was enough to force them to treat this battle seriously.</p>
 <p>Hidden Weapon Twin Dragon Explosion!</p>
 <p>Two Frosted Iron Balls shot out like shooting stars, projecting a heart throbbing gleam with its pitch black color. It was the epitome of the beauty of death itself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's skill in dealing with hidden weapons had already grown better than a few days ago. Even the hidden weapons themselves had leveled up tremendously qualitatively. They were much more formidable than when he killed Sima Sha previously.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>Although the hidden weapons were powerful and the Frosted Iron Balls were tempered with a strong poison, it was still insufficient to rely on Twin Dragon Explosion to kill a Peak Grade Eight Martial Saint who was a distance away.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the opponents were experts in the use of poison themselves. However, they hadn’t expected the two Frosted Iron Balls to suddenly explode.</p>
 <p>The moment they were forced to desperately dodge the attack, Qing Shui suddenly pushed forth, shooting out another two Frosted Iron Balls.</p>
 <p>Twin Dragon Pearls!</p>
