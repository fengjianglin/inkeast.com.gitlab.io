 <p><strong>Chapter 67 Xiantian, Wenren Wu-Shuang.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0067 – Xiantian, Wenren Wu-Shuang</strong></p>
  <p>After Qing Shui finished his outburst, he stared at the two beautiful sisters while awkwardly rubbing his nose. Sh*t, was I too vulgar? Even if I want to fool around, I can’t be so straightforward. In any case, I shouldn’t be losing my virginity in this type of place.</p>
  <p>“Errr, that was not what I meant!”</p>
  <p>“Understood. In reality, I approached you for another reason. Are you the same Qing Shui who defeated the bunch of self-deluded young masters that hail from the four great clans?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui furrowed his brows in displeasure. No one was willing to be spied upon and investigated. Even though it was him who had defeated the bunch of good for nothings, his name shouldn’t be known to the general populace, as the four great clans would most likely want to keep it a secret. Unless they made a special effort to investigate closer in more detail, there was no way that his name should have appeared.</p>
  <p>“Don’t be mistaken, we did not specially conduct an investigation on you. That day, when you defeated the various young masters, I was nearby and witnessed everything. As for today, when I spotted you down the streets, my sister was curious. It did not appear that you are here for the services provided, and thus, the earlier scenario you witnessed, was planned to happen.” Hints of laughter could be seen from the beautiful, charming black eyes of the younger sister, as she tried to appease Qing Shui’s anger.</p>
  <p>“A beauty capable of toppling empires!” When he saw her smile, Qing Shui felt that the description was apt.</p>
  <p>“Are the two of you blood sisters? Is the Night Fragrant Court a business owned by both of you?” Qing Shui asked after he calmed down.</p>
  <p>“Yup, she is my blood sister Wenren Wu-Gou, and I am Wenren Wu-Shuang!” Maybe it was a declaration of her sincerity, but Wenren Wu-Shuang offered her name without being asked.</p>
  <p>“The Night Fragrant Court, is the business owned by my elder sister. I offered to help out as I’m just passing by.” Wenren Wu-Shuang inclined her head as she smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Are there still any other questions that you would like to ask?” Wenren Wu-Gou interjected with hints of flirtation coloring her tone.</p>
  <p>When compared to Wenren Wu-Shuang, Wenren Wu-Gou was basically a born seductress, everything about her – her personality, her features, her figure, her mannerisms, her sense of style, they all indicated that she was a man-eater. Even though Wenren Wu-Shuang exceeded her elder sister in terms of features and aura exuded, Qing Shui was still firmly sure that if he had to make a choice between the two, he would choose to bed Wenren Wu-Gou instead. After all, all men like their women to be more passionate in bed. He would rather bed a hot chick than a dead fish in any given scenarios.</p>
  <p>“However, if I could somehow brainwash and train the younger sister Wenren Wu-Shuang to be naughty just for my sake, hehehe, I can die with no regrets!” Qing Shui started fantasizing again.</p>
  <p>“As the saints and monks cautioned, ‘Avoid Gluttony and Lust!’ However I am just an ordinary mortal, I’m not wrong, I’m right. Amitabha!” Qing Shui started to mumble incoherent words absent-mindedly, causing the two sisters to be filled with curiosity.</p>
  <p>“I don’t understand. In order to operate in this line of business it requires one to have a certain level of backing and strength.” Qing Shui directed the question to Wenren Wu-Gou. Even though asking this question felt somewhat like an invasion of her privacy, Qing Shui decided to still plough on ahead and ask. After all, the two sisters knew everything about him while he had no inkling of their backgrounds.</p>
  <p>“Who says that we lack strength? Can’t you tell the strength level of my sister Wenren Wu-Shuang?” Wenren Wu-Gou blinked her beautiful eyes slowly, as she teased Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Upon hearing that, Qing Shui once again turned his head to inspect Wenren Wu-Shuang more closely. Her features seemed to be designed intricately by God, the epitome of refined intelligence. Her charming face was only further accentuated by those bright eyes of hers. In addition to her jade-like, high-chiseled nose, and her red-tinged sexy little lips, she could only be described like a snow lotus amongst volcanic embers.</p>
  <p>Her figure was not as extreme as that of her elder sister, but was something more closely resembling Yu He. Shapely, but not overly so. One could see the arcs of her twin peaks clearly outlined, and the contours of her perky butt, even when covered by her pyjamas. While her long and shapely legs shined with the glow of pure jade, invoking feelings of desires in men.</p>
  <p>This woman, in any sense of the word, was close to a level of perfection. Her whole body exuded a refined aura similar to that of a celestial being.</p>
  <p>“This aura feels exceedingly mysterious!” Qing Shui’s clear eyes closely focused on Wenren Wu-Shuang, and his gaze continued roaming around her body, as he attempted to unravel the mystery.</p>
  <p>A rosy red blossomed on Wenren Wu-Shuang’s cheeks. It was unknown if this was caused by the heat emitted from the heated pool, or because of Qing Shui’s inspection of her. Or maybe it was caused by the words from her elder sister earlier, Wenren Wu-Gou, “Can’t you tell the strength level of my sister Wenren Wu-Shuang?”.</p>
  <p>Although Qing Shui did not grasp the hidden meaning behind that sentence, Wu-Shuang could only go red, as she somewhat understood the lewd joke her elder sister was making.</p>
  <p>“In Hundred Miles City, there were still quite a few publicly known figures with cultivation at the peak of the Houtian stage. But as for Xiantian cultivators, no one knows clearly knew how many the great clans possessed. The Night Fragrance Court, was an extremely popular place for men. To think that even those young masters from the various great clans did not dare to cause a ruckus here.”</p>
  <p>This meant that the Night Fragrance Court had strength beyond them. This meant that behind these two sisters, clearly, there was someone of immense strength and solid status supporting them in the background.</p>
  <p>“Stop your wild guessing. Both me and my sisters were orphans, and were adopted by our teacher. However, he unfortunately passed away a few years ago. In the past, when our teacher was still alive, no one dared to make trouble for our Night Fragrance Court. After he passed away, we didn’t dare to tell anyone, so we still remained under the bubble of protection provided by the name of our teacher. Luckily for us, at the beginning of this year, Wu-Shuang achieved a breakthrough. Only then did I finally relax.” Wenren Wu-Gou explained.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s furrowed his brows deeper and deeper, as he heard the explanation of Wenren Wu-Gou. Even if Wu-Shuang broke through, so what about it? Even if she was at the Martial Commander Realm, her power would still be insufficient to stop the young masters from the various clans coming over here to create trouble. Unless….</p>
  <p>“WHAT THE, could it be…? Xiantian?” Qing Shui gasped in shock, as he staggered backwards, looking at Wenren Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang nodded her head shyly, “A moment of karmic luck, that’s how I broke through. Truth to be told, it still feels like a dream to me.” Rolling her sleeves, revealing her jade-white hands, Wenren Wu-Shuang extended one of her arm slowly and gently, as a tyrannical surge of energy emanated forth from her. This aura she released, was as sharp as 10,000 swords, threatening to overwhelm Qing Shui, before she quickly retracted it.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stood there dumbly. He knew that he had just experienced the aura of a Xiantian cultivator. What a terrifying aura, especially the pressure contained within. It felt that Xiantian cultivators could kill him as easily as a flipping a palm. This Xiantian Qi, could be utilized in such a way that it could be coated around the fist, the palms, or even around weapons.</p>
  <p>This girl in front of him looked so young. To think she would have a lifespan of 500 years! She had already embarked onto a path, and broken through the doorway where many others had no hope to do so!</p>
  <p>Looking at Wenren Wu-Shuang, Qing Shui could tell that she was truly favored by the heavens. How far would she be able to walk on this path on the future? With grace bestowed onto her by the Heavens, she was akin to a ferocious tiger exiting the mountain, or a flood dragon emerging from the sea.</p>
  <p>“Congratulations! You are the first person I met that had broken through to the fabled Xiantian realm. Initially, I thought that all Xiantian cultivators were old men with white hair, or at the very least, they would be middle-aged.” Qing Shui smiled as he joked about his own ignorance.</p>
  <p>“Thank you. Actually the reason we went to that extent to invite you here, was because we are very curious about your sword techniques. How did you manage to reach such a realm? If it is convenient, could you please tell us?” That gaze of Wenren Wu-Shuang, was something no man could reject.</p>
  <p>“I’m not a smart man, as you can see, the sword technique I grasped were those of the most basic kind. I just practiced the same sword move, unceasingly over 10 years, and stabbed out countless numbers of sword stabs, before I could reach the level I had today.” Qing Shui touched his nose slightly as he awkwardly explained.</p>
  <p>Both Wu-Gou and Wu-Shuang looked at Qing Shui, stunned.</p>
  <p>After a while, Wenren Wu-Shuang joyfully exclaimed as radiance suffused her features, “I wonder… I’m not sure if you have unparalleled intelligence, or if you are an idiot.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui glanced suspiciously at her.</p>
  <p>“My teacher had once said that the moves recorded in the &lt;&lt;<span style>Basic Sword Techniques&gt;</span>&gt; book were not as simple and basic on the surface as described. Back then, I couldn’t understand the meaning of his words. However, when I saw you that day, I knew that you had already reached the realm of sword truths, and comprehended the true meaning of the sword.”</p>

Even if she was at the Martial Commander Realm, her power would still be insufficient to stop the young masters from the various clans coming over here to create trouble. Unless….</p>
 <p>“WHAT THE, could it be…? Xiantian?” Qing Shui gasped in shock, as he staggered backwards, looking at Wenren Wu-Shuang.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang nodded her head shyly, “A moment of karmic luck, that’s how I broke through. Truth to be told, it still feels like a dream to me.” Rolling her sleeves, revealing her jade-white hands, Wenren Wu-Shuang extended one of her arm slowly and gently, as a tyrannical surge of energy emanated forth from her. This aura she released, was as sharp as 10,000 swords, threatening to overwhelm Qing Shui, before she quickly retracted it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood there dumbly. He knew that he had just experienced the aura of a Xiantian cultivator. What a terrifying aura, especially the pressure contained within. It felt that Xiantian cultivators could kill him as easily as a flipping a palm. This Xiantian Qi, could be utilized in such a way that it could be coated around the fist, the palms, or even around weapons.</p>
 <p>This girl in front of him looked so young. To think she would have a lifespan of 500 years! She had already embarked onto a path, and broken through the doorway where many others had no hope to do so!</p>
 <p>Looking at Wenren Wu-Shuang, Qing Shui could tell that she was truly favored by the heavens. How far would she be able to walk on this path on the future? With grace bestowed onto her by the Heavens, she was akin to a ferocious tiger exiting the mountain, or a flood dragon emerging from the sea.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations! You are the first person I met that had broken through to the fabled Xiantian realm. Initially, I thought that all Xiantian cultivators were old men with white hair, or at the very least, they would be middle-aged.” Qing Shui smiled as he joked about his own ignorance.</p>
 <p>“Thank you. Actually the reason we went to that extent to invite you here, was because we are very curious about your sword techniques. How did you manage to reach such a realm? If it is convenient, could you please tell us?” That gaze of Wenren Wu-Shuang, was something no man could reject.</p>
 <p>“I’m not a smart man, as you can see, the sword technique I grasped were those of the most basic kind. I just practiced the same sword move, unceasingly over 10 years, and stabbed out countless numbers of sword stabs, before I could reach the level I had today.” Qing Shui touched his nose slightly as he awkwardly explained.</p>
 <p>Both Wu-Gou and Wu-Shuang looked at Qing Shui, stunned.</p>
 <p>After a while, Wenren Wu-Shuang joyfully exclaimed as radiance suffused her features, “I wonder… I’m not sure if you have unparalleled intelligence, or if you are an idiot.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui glanced suspiciously at her.</p>
 <p>“My teacher had once said that the moves recorded in the &lt;&lt;<span style>Basic Sword Techniques&gt;</span>&gt; book were not as simple and basic on the surface as described. Back then, I couldn’t understand the meaning of his words. However, when I saw you that day, I knew that you had already reached the realm of sword truths, and comprehended the true meaning of the sword.”</p>
