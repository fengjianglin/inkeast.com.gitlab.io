 <p><strong>AST 635 - The heaven-defying Nine Continent Boots, Village of Mo Clan, Everything goes off without a hitch!</strong></p>
 <p>The Village of Mo Clan used to be a really famous village in the past. At one point, it was not at all inferior to the current Village of Longevity. Even though it had suffered a decline later, its former reputation had still been passed on to the present day.</p>
 <p>Every cultivator with a certain level of ability would have heard about the history of the Village of Mo Clan. It was just that there were very few people left who knew about the village’s exact location.</p>
 <p>After finding out about the location of the Village of Mo Clan from Di Xuan, Qing Shui realized that it would only take him a day to go there.</p>
 <p>He remembered that Village of Mo Clan was at the bottom of Fire Plume Mountain, but without knowing the location, he still would have to spend some time to search for it.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui was still hesitant on his course of action. He still had enough time to look for Lady Duanmu because he had the formidable Nine Continents Steps Effect of his Nine Continent’s Boots.</p>
 <p>He had another three days left and with Qing Shui’s Nine Continents Steps Effect and the speed of the Fire Bird, it would only take him at most two days to rush back there. Even though it would technically save him a day if he went to Village of Mo Clan, he would still have to search for it.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, will you be able to manage to rush back here in three days? Actually, if you are able to weaken our opponent down to around my level, I’m quite confident that I would be able to deal with him.” Di Xuan explained after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Senior Di, are you sure that it would take Old Freak Ba three days to rush here?” Qing Shui had been contemplating this for quite a while. He feared that Old Freak Ba would turn up as soon as he left. If that were to happen, all of his efforts would truly have been for naught.</p>
 <p>As he thought about it, cold sweat started dripping down his body. If Old Freak Ba had a treasure as heaven-defying as his Nine Continent’s Boots, the consequences of that would be unimaginable.</p>
 <p>However, given the current situation, Qing Shui felt that the Di Clan wouldn’t be able to contest Old Freak Ba unless he looked for a person to assist them.</p>
 <p>“Senior Di, please point out the direction to the Village of Mo Clan. I will make it back in the morning two days from now at the latest. If all goes well, I will be able to rush back here by tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>“Don't worry, I have something special and can travel really quickly. I'm sure that I will be able to make it back in time.” Qing Shui said with a confident tone.</p>
 <p>“Alright! Even though I should’ve dealt with this matter myself, I'll show you the way.” Di Xuan led Qing Shui out the room.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head. He knew that Di Xuan suspected that he might flee on his own but didn’t explain himself, knowing he could only express his dedication through his actions. Furthermore, given what Di Xuan knew about the way to the Village of Mo Clan, he believed that it would be almost impossible for Qing Shui to make it back by the day after tomorrow.</p>
 <p>These reasons were why Di Xuan assumed Qing Shui was intending to flee. As he had no way to stop it, he sighed in his heart as he Skywalked into the air.</p>
 <p>“Can you see the mountain? If you head straight in that direction, you will arrive in Fire Plume Mountain. The Village of Mo Clan is right below Fire Plume Mountain.” Di Xuan showed Qing Shui the way to Village of Mo Clan.</p>
 <p>“There is no time to lose. Even though I am just an ordinary person, I am someone who keeps his promises.” Qing Shui waved his hand at Di Xuan. After that, he revolved his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique according to the Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan waved back at Qing Shui, and as the latter’s figure became more and more blurry, everyone had an expression of shock. At the moment, Di Xuan actually believed that what Qing Shui said was true.</p>
 <p>At the same time, his face also started feeling hot. There were many people who harboured his same thoughts, other than Di Fenxing, who did not change his opinion.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, time passed as if it was simultaneously an instant and ten years. As soon as Qing Shui recovered his wits, he found himself around a desolate mountain. He looked around the surroundings before summoning the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>He followed the directions given to him and rushed straight ahead!</p>
 <p>This was because Qing Shui could see the figure of a red mountain in the distance. It looked like a burning feather from far away...</p>
 <p>Fire Plume Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could already recognize the mountain with just one glance. The Village of Mo Clan was located right at its bottom.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped hesitating and made his way there riding the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Even though the mountain was visible, it was still a few thousand li away from him. However, with the elephant’s speed, it would take him around one hour to reach it.</p>
 <p>Very soon, Qing Shui was already close to Fire Plume Mountain. The Fire Plume Mountain was considered average in size, as it was a thousand meters tall and extended out by ten li. He could clearly see that the area was actually a volcanic zone, with the surrounding temperature being much higher compared to other places.</p>
 <p>In addition to that, the stones here were colored red. They looked like burning stones from far away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood in the middle of the air and looked down the mountain. Perhaps because it was a volcano, the mountain was bald and smooth. However, at the bottom of the mountain, there was some sparse vegetation.</p>
 <p>The Village of Mo Clan!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept repeating as he used his eyes to search. Eventually, he descended to a lower height and started searching more quickly. After all, there were tens of miles to search through and he couldn't see the entire area just with one glance. It was still considered quite a tough task to look for a small village in such a large area.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui saw some smoke from far away, at an area behind a hill. Qing Shui felt excited and hurriedly ordered the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to fly faster towards the direction of the smoke.</p>
 <p>As soon as he crossed the hill, he saw some old and simple houses. Each of the houses was surrounded by a gate and the cries of pets could be heard.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sent the Diamond Gigantic Elephant back into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and walked towards the village on the hill.</p>
 <p>Nearby, there were three men who were approaching him, wearing Beast skins and holding some simple weapons. They all had a masculine build and their exposed muscles looked well defined and shiny. They were chatting with each other as they walked towards him.</p>
 <p>“Hello uncles, is this the Village of Mo Clan?” Qing Shui smiled as he asked the three middle-aged men.</p>
 <p>When the three middle-aged men saw Qing Shui, they became warier instantly. The tall man in the middle glanced towards Qing Shui: “ Who are you? What are you here for?”</p>
 <p>“There’s an old granny, oh, she has a grandson too. I treated him before, but I still lacked a kind of medicine at that time. The old Granny said that I could come look for her once I found it.” Qing Shui only spoke half the truth. Nevertheless, it wasn't considered lying.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so it was you who treated the grandson of Mo Clan. Where does Old Lady Mo live in? She lives at the most eastern part of the village. You will know once you’re there.” one of the middle-aged men said respectfully.</p>
 <p>“Thank you uncle!”</p>
 <p>Village of Mo Clan, Old Lady Mo. Qing Shui felt that this Village was somewhat related to Mo Clan. It was said that a long time ago, the Village of Mo Clan wasn’t at all inferior to Village of Longevity. However, it was said that a huge volcanic eruption led to the slow decline of the village.</p>
 <p>Even though this place was really hot, it had a very natural feel as a really huge and expansive land. From time to time, there would be two or three mischievous kids, and their carefree laughing sounds were able to make the people here feel really relaxed and happy.</p>
 <p>A small four or five meter wide river meandered through the village. The water in it was quite shallow and clear, and there were children swimming there. Some people were fishing and others were washing their clothes. Qing Shui felt really peaceful observing the daily lives of these residents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui crossed the bridge and headed towards the eastern most side of the Village of Mo Clan.</p>
 <p>The buildings around here were all made of wood, simple but with an unique atmosphere. Such a feeling was very similar to the cultural flavor of bamboo houses.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui spotted a small boy standing in front of a house. He recognized him with a glance, it was the little boy he had saved before. He seemed taller and stronger than before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled gently as he walked towards the boy. He knew that he had found the right place.</p>
 <p>“Hey buddy, is your granny home?”Qing Shui approached the boy and squatted down.</p>
 <p>“She is at home!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui heard the sound of footsteps, Qing Shui lifted his head up and saw an old woman tottering out of the house. When she saw Qing Shui, she smiled.</p>
 <p>“You’re here!”</p>
 <p>“Yes granny, has your grandson been well?” Qing Shui smiled as he stood up.</p>
 <p>“He is doing really good! Come in! I have prepared some food.”</p>
 <p>“Sure!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui picked up the little boy and followed the old woman into the simple house.</p>
 <p>The dishes of fish and meat were really sumptuous and it was clear the old woman was quite good at cooking.</p>
 <p>“Is there anything that you need this old woman’s help with?”</p>
 <p>The old woman laughed when she saw Qing Shui put down his bowl.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't hold back when he told the old woman about everything that had happened. He even confessed the things about Old freak Ba and the Red Jiao’s strength. He was observing the old woman’s face as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, please don't make fun of me. I'm a only a Grade 9 Martial Saint warrior. Maybe I will barely be a match with the red Jiao.” A bitter look flashed across the old woman’s face.</p>
 <p>Grade 9 Martial Saint!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really surprised with the old woman’s strength. He had never expected her to be this strong… even Di Xuan was only just an Grade 8 Martial Saint warrior.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really happy. A Grade 9 Martial Saint was more than enough. If nothing unexpected happened, the old woman’s help would be sufficient to solve the issue. However, Qing Shui could tell that there was something strange about the old woman, as if she was hiding her strength. Nevertheless, he didn't really want to ask about it.</p>
 <p>“It's quite urgent, let’s make a move immediately. Granny will protect you even if it means that I will die.” A firm look flashed across the old woman’s face.</p>
 <p>“Granny, don't worry, I have some special moves that can reduce their strength. We will win this for sure.” Qing Shui happily explained to the old woman.</p>
 <p>When the old woman heard Qing Shui’s words, a surprised look flashed across her face: “That's really great, wait for me for a while, I'm going to send Little An here to Old Man Xiong temporarily. After that, let's head there together.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, thank you granny.”</p>
 <p>“Little brat, you don’t have to stand on ceremony with me!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected things to turn out so smoothly. It had only been around four hours since he departed the Di Clan and he had only stayed at the Old Woman’s house for about two hours.</p>
 <p>Without further delay, both Qing Shui and the old woman rode the Fire Bird and rushed back towards Seven Stars City.</p>
