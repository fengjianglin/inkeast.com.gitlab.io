 <p><strong>AST 1393 - Killing Two People, The Great Power of the Hell's Phoenix</strong></p>
 <p>Anyone could tell that Qing Shui was actually scolding the people from Che Clan for being arrogant and throwing their weight about to bully others. However, the way Qing Shui said it left a more memorable impression.</p>
 <p>Che Chi didn't wish to let Qing Shui carry on and swung his pair of hammers. "You better bring out your true abilities. It's useless to just rely on all talk."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the figure that came charging over. The old man had a circle of red light that looked like flames around him. Even the two huge hammers he was holding had turned crimson red. He appeared next to Qing Shui with a flash and the pair of hammers came smashing down with two rows of afterimages.</p>
 <p>Powerful... Qing Shui could now sense the old man's strength. He should be about Peak Grade Five False God. Even if he wasn't at peak, he should be close. He was one of Che Clan's top notch cultivators.</p>
 <p>For False Gods, one would first look at the grade. Grade five was the first great demarcation in the False God realm. Another thing that people would look at would be the Heavenly Technique. If a Grade Four False God's Heavenly Technique was powerful enough, the person could stand up against or even defeat a Grade Five False God.</p>
 <p>This old man had already gone through several False God Tribulations and he was also the most powerful opponent Qing Shui had encountered. Of course, this was with the exception of that old man who wore green phoenix prints. Although Qing Shui didn't fight against the other old man, he knew that that man was definitely more powerful that Che Chi.</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dare to let his guard down in the least. At the same time, the tea cup he was holding was thrown out with the Hidden Weapon technique!</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A crisp sound rang out but the force that came from the cup still took the old man by surprise. After being weakened by 30%, the old man's strength was only left with slightly over 10 million sun...</p>
 <p>Although the force from Qing Shui's hidden weapon wasn't enough to defeat Che Chi, it did let him feel a powerful force from a tiny little cup.</p>
 <p>The old man was astonished by the impact from the cup and even more so by Qing Shui's ability to weaken his opponent's strength. Right now, he felt uncomfortable all over to be without 30% of his power. The battle would become unpredictable. It was because his consciousness and judgment were all geared for when his strength was at slightly more than 15 million sun.</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui managed to grab this opportunity for a one-on-one fight, he wouldn't hold back. With a flash, he appeared behind the old man. With Qing Shui's current level of defense, as long as the old man didn't perform a Heavenly Technique, Qing Shui wasn't afraid to be hit.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the Paragon Golden Armor could still withstand a fatal attack!</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui decided to give up on defense and just attacked. After Che Chi had been weakened, he become only slightly more powerful than Che Qi. Therefore, right now, Qing Shui was performing all his killing moves without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Boom boom!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly followed up with the Phoenix Finger for the second time. He moved away and then elusively made his way back for another strike!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Third time!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui retreated once again. This old man was very powerful. Although he had performed the Phoenix Finger three times, there seemed to be no visible changes. Qing Shui had attacked the old man's acupoints but in the middle, he had been sent flying by the old man twice.</p>
 <p>Despite having a powerful defense, it wouldn't stop him from being sent flying. Che Chi realized that Qing Shui was very different and Qing Shui also felt that the old man's acupuncture points were very unique. It should be that his Phoenix Finger had not struck his acupuncture points. Otherwise, it was impossible for the old man to not show any reactions.</p>
 <p>When the old man smashed his hammers toward Qing Shui again...</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Confusion Steps!</p>
 <p>Meridians Tapping！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui changed to use the Meridians Tapping stance in the Phoenix Finger and the effect was shown immediately. With just one strike, Che Chi was pushed back and the arm which he had been struck on kept trembling. He almost threw his hammer.</p>
 <p>With a flash, Qing Shui followed after him like a shadow and attacked again. His powerful defense allowed him to worry a lot less.</p>
 <p>Boom boom!</p>
 <p>Attacking twice with the Phoenix Finger.</p>
 <p>Che Chi threw away one of is hammers and his arm was in so much pain that he could no longer lift it up.</p>
 <p>A vicious glare flashed in Che Chi's eyes. However, at this moment, Qing Shui disappeared from his sight.</p>
 <p>He had the feeling that Che Chi was going to use his Heavenly Technique's killing techniques and thus disappeared. However, the time which he could disappear for was very short. When he appeared once again, Qing Shui's arms appeared at Che Chi's Taiyang Acupoint.</p>
 <p>There were some acupuncture points on a human body that would never shift, no matter what terrifying level cultivators reached. For example, the Taiyang Acupoint, the Baihui Acupoint...</p>
 <p>Pfft pfft!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left instantly and the old man looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. Then, blood slowly flowed out from his seven apertures and he dropped down. He hadn't even been able to use his Heavenly Techniques.</p>
 <p>“Third Uncle!”</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Kill him! Everyone attack him together! Kill him!"</p>
 <p>"Tear him into pieces! Get him to suffer a fate that's worse than death!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't move but just smiled as he looked at the few people in the lead. Those people who were shouting were actually still under the command of those in the front. Therefore, before the people in front said anything, they would only shout. Moreover, only just over ten people were shouting. After all, all of them were powerful experts. The ones who were shouting were the old man's kin.</p>
 <p>Even those people who didn't shout were all glaring at Qing Shui. If gazes could kill, Qing Shui would have been killed by each person several tens of times.</p>
 <p>"I'm seeing you in a new light now. Your battle techniques are very powerful. If you don't share them and they get lost after your death, it'd be such a pity. Hmm, no, the two ladies with you should know them too, right?"</p>
 <p>The person who spoke wasn't the old man wearing green phoenix print. It was an old man next to him, an expert from Che Clan. He didn't seem too sad when Che Chi died. There hadn't even been a hint of change to his expression.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's eyes narrowed, "You're really courting death."</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, you have powerful defense and you also rely on that powerful battle technique. Without it, you won't be able to fend off the Blood River Chariot Formation," the old man took a long meaningful look at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>"There shouldn't be any problems to kill you with this battle technique!" Qing Shui said coldly.</p>
 <p>"I'll take you on a one-on-one fight. I'll make you regret this," the old man said confidently.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had still felt a little uneasy at the beginning but after recalling that he still had an ace up his sleeve, he felt more at ease and charged out toward the old man.</p>
 <p>This old man was about the same level as the previous one but the even if they were at the same level, the damaging prowess each of them unleashed would be different. It was just like how, in Qing Shui's previous life, even if both side had the same amount of strength, if one had the skill, he could take on multiple opponents at the same time. This was the difference with their damaging prowess.</p>
 <p>Weakening, Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>This time around, the old man was stunned as well. It was only when he was in the same shoes that he could understand it. Earlier on, he had only thought that Che Chi didn't use his full power and died from carelessness. He was still feeling upset over why Che Chi could make such a simple mistake like that. He now knew that he was wrong. This kid was even more tricky than he had expected.</p>
 <p>The old man was only out of it for an instant when Qing Shui's Phoenix Finger had already tapped on his body.</p>
 <p>Sealing Gods Suppressing Devils!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a mysterious violet color gushed forth form the old man's body, wrapping around Qing Shui's hands. Qing Shui quickly retreated and realized that he didn't feel any discomfort. However, something felt different.</p>
 <p>"This is my Heavenly Technique's killing ability. It can seal up the battle technique that the opponent uses. For the next one day, you won't be able to use this battle technique again." Saying this, the old man smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't believe it and tried using the Phoenix Finger on the spot. However, the moment he did so, he was caught by surprise. It was because he realized that it was as if he didn't know how to use the Phoenix Finger.</p>
 <p>He hadn't expected for there to be a Heavenly Technique like this. Heavenly Techniques like these would only be able to seal the opponent's skills when the other party was using it. Therefore, he was unable to seal up one's Heavenly Technique's killing moves. After all, it could only be used once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of his Emperor's Qi. However, recalling how domineering it was, he felt that the chances of it being sealed up would be very low.</p>
 <p>"Come on, what other abilities do you have?" the old man seemed to be very proud. Although he had always been able to use this move, he had always felt upset at how other people's Heavenly Techniques could increase attacking prowess by a lot or even kill with one strike. His, on the other hand, seemed so much weaker and it wasn't able to seal one's killing moves.</p>
 <p>However, it was under this situation that he knew that his Heavenly Technique's killing technique would still have its use.</p>
 <p>"It's still really easy to kill you." Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>"Then come on. Your strength lies only in that battle technique. Could it be that you have Heavenly Techniques? At your level, do you really?" The old man laughed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as well and then disappeared on the spot.</p>
 <p>Shadowless Paragon!</p>
 <p>Speed was strength!</p>
 <p>Paragon Strike!</p>
 <p>Spiritual lock on!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui appeared directly next to the old man and used his Heavenly Technique. It surpassed the old man's strength of 5 million sun and hit him right on the head.</p>
 <p>The entire world fell silent!</p>
 <p>The Shadowless Paragon and the Paragon Strike were a perfect match. It was a pity that the Paragon Strike could only be used once.</p>
 <p>He was still left with 15 minutes to use the Shadowless Paragon!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's act of killing the old man with a single move caused there to be a moment of silence. It was so quiet that one could hear the sound of breathing.</p>
 <p>"Demon, he's a demon! Everyone attack him together! Kill him!"</p>
 <p>There were only three old men left in the front now, including the old man wearing clothing with green phoenix print. The one who said that was one of the other two old men and he even took the lead to charge out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The moment this old man took action, the old one didn't dare to let down his guard and quickly followed. Naturally, all the others behind also followed suit. The old man wearing the green phoenix clothes didn't move but he continued to keep his gaze on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>No one knew what he was thinking. His expression didn't change in the least from the very beginning.</p>
 <p>Looking at the people who came charging over, Qing Shui swung his arm and the Hell's Phoenix appeared in the air!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix!</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's performed all these in a series.</p>
 <p>Boom boom...</p>
 <p>Ning ning...</p>
 <p>Hellfire!</p>
 <p>The Hell's Phoenix sent a spread of pitch black flames raining down. They were as dark as black treasured stones and the color gave off an eerie feeling. It was as if they had came down from the deep underground, as if it was going to incinerate all souls.</p>
 <p>Although the Hell's Inferno wasn't as powerful as the Underworld Fireball, Early False Gods wouldn't be able to withstand it and those at the Peak of their grades would be dealt serious injuries. There were even some unlucky ones who would faint from the Mighty Elephant Stomp and then ended up being incinerated later.</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>In an instant, the place around them became an ocean!</p>
 <p>Although there were no impact to the two old men in front, after being weakened, what awaited them was death.</p>
 <p>Underworld Fireball!</p>
 <p>The powerful Underworld Fireball would also lock onto the opponent spiritually. However, the lock-on wasn't something absolute. One wouldn't be able to dodge it and could only stop it unless done in midway. It was because the moment one came into contact with it, it would explode. It wasn't that hard to stop it but as it was released in close proximity and at very high speed, the first thing that came to one's mind would be to dodge.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when the Underworld Fireball struck onto the body of one of the old men, he was already dealt severe injuries. But this wasn't the end.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>With an earth-shaking sound, the old man disappeared in the air. Everyone in Che Clan felt as if the end of the world was coming.</p>
