 <p><strong>Chapter 440 Six Sects Tournament, Xi Ri, He is Qing Shui…..</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>&nbsp; AST 440 - Six Sects Tournament, Xi Ri, He is Qing Shui….</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Senior Martial Uncle, will there be many people participating in such a bloodthirsty tournament?” Qing Shui believed that a tournament essentially made for people who want revenge would not have that many participants.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The tournament will start with people who have grudges with each other, as these battles end in either death or disability, so the hatred between the two sides gradually deepens. Once this spiral of bloodlust starts, everything else becomes secondary. That’s why every single Six Sects Tournament ends in a bloodbath.” Fei Wuji laughed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wouldn’t that mean that many talented people will die?” Qing Shui asked doubtfully.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ha ha. People who have not gone through the thunderstorms in life, who have not undergone the vicissitudes of life, cannot be considered talented people.” Fei Wuji said softly with a confident inflection. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This made Qing Shui remember a saying. Killing a single person is treated as a crime; massacring ten thousand is treated as heroism. Massacring nine million people would thus be considered the bravest of heroisms.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After killing ten thousand people, one will gain a strong aura of death; when one has killed nine million people, one will attain an incredibly murderous aura that overshadows even the ominous aura that accompanies it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was already afternoon when Qing Shui returned to his own place. When he arrived, he saw a girl standing there and smiling at him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling’er!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Older Brother Qing Shui..”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought that he would not have any interaction with anyone from the Yan Clan after he had resolved the Yan Clan issue. However, he had forgotten about Yan Ling’er and how they were now living one floor away from each other.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am not your brother…” Qing Shui was speechless.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t care. I want to call you my brother.” Yan Ling’er was older than Qing Shui by only a couple days. But she was used to calling him ‘Older Brother Qing Shui’, so she did not even bother changing it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I no longer have any business with the Yan Clan.” Qing Shui stood his ground and replied.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So what if you have no business with the Yan Clan. I also hate the Yan Clan. I wish I am not from a Yan, but this is not my choice.” Yan Ling’er replied dispiritedly as she looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Right, she had no choice in this. Just like himself, he also did not have a choice. At this moment, Qing Shui did not feel good about this. Their generation all had broken families.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Whatever.” Qing Shui said has he headed upstairs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling’er followed him upstairs as a faint smile appeared on her face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was about to close the door, Yan Ling’er quickly slipped in. Qing Shui was startled to a halt for a moment before he close the door. He turned to look at Yan Ling’er.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What are you doing? I am tired, and I want to rest.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, you are tired. Then, you can just sleep. Just ignore me. I want to just take a look around here.” Yan Ling’er blinked her pair of innocent-looking eyes twice.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at those innocent eyes. Even though he knew she was faking it, his heart softened. She was a very proud girl, so it must have taken a lot of courage for her to do this. Even he might not have the courage to do such a thing himself.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, I did not know that things were this way. You and auntie must have suffered all these years.” Yan Ling’er immediately knew she had made a mistake once she said that. She looked at Qing Shui anxiously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She found that Qing Shui was not angry. Up until now, Qing Shui knew that the other branches of the Yan Clan were just helpless victims of the incident. He did not want to hold on to those grudges stubbornly, since, after all, those members of the Yan Clan were all dead.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Fine, since you want to stay here, then go ahead. I am going to rest first!” Qing Shui said to Yan Ling’er wearily.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling’er nodded her head cheerfully. Even though Qing Shui did not seem friendly now, she knew that things were changing and that Qing Shui’s hatred towards her had lessened.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Night came and the moonlight shone into the room. Qing Shui came out from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He could not fall asleep at the moment. He had reached the 143th cycle of his Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was easier to reach a breakthrough now. He just had to accumulate enough power to reach the breakthrough. During this period of time, Qing Shui’s strength had risen unbelievably fast.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This rate of growth would only plateau at the 179th cycle, so Qing Shui needed to improve as quickly as possible and try to shorten the time required. Once he reaches the 180th cycle, the rate at which he’d achieve breakthroughs would fall again.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that once he reaches the 179th cycle, his capabilities would improve vastly. With this increase, he had a feeling more dangers would crop up ahead.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood by the window while looking at the quiet and boundless starry sky. The skies were sprinkled with twinkling stars that shone gently beside the full moon.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Qing Shui had never thought of going back. When he first arrived in the World of the Nine continents, he was a little apprehensive. But when he saw Qing Yi’s hopeful gaze, he gradually got used to this world. After all, he experienced growing up here and witnessed his mother’s love. When he was a baby, instead of the blank state that all infants had, he slowly observed how great his mother’s love was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“When the sun rises, it will be the first day of the Six Sects tournament.” The moonlight cast a reflection in Qing Shui’s eyes. Qing Shui looked at the distant skies and felt a little despondent. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tan Yang. You better not appear on the battle stage. Don’t let me see you.” Qing Shui closed his eyes sadly. He forced himself not to think of Mingyue Gelou and Little Yuchang.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could feel that these repressed emotions were tearing his heart apart.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The next day, Qing Shui went to the public square for his morning practice. He found Gongsun Jianyun and a large group of people practising their Taichi Fist solemnly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was surprised to find that many of them had already gotten the knack for Taichi and were able to express the grace of Taichi. There are a few like Gongsun Jianyun who have already reached the master level of the technique.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was silently amazed by Gongsun Jianyun. He had a high natural aptitude and could be considered a genius of the Starmoon Hall before he met Qing Shui. Unfortunately, Qing Shui’s prestige had totally buried his.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big Brother Qing Shui!” Gongsun Jianyun spotted Qing Shui and ran over in surprise.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; “Big Brother QIng Shui！”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; “Big Brother QIng Shui！”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many of them had spoken to Qing Shui before, so they came over to greet him. They looked at Qing Shui with a lot of admiration and respect. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Since when was I so close with them?” Qing Shui gave Gongsun Jianyun a puzzled look. To not make things difficult, Qing Shui reciprocated by smiling at them in a friendly manner. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, when did you come back?” Gongsun Jianyun asked unceremoniously.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Age could make someone old, and age could also make someone more mature. Qing Shui could see the apparent change in Gongsun Jianyun’s demeanor. His image had totally changed, he was no longer that proud and haughty playboy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I came back yesterday. All of you wake up really early!” Qing Shui replied with a smile as he slowly went into the starting Taichi pose.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they saw that Qing Shui was beginning his practice, they quietly backed off. It was indeed easy to spot an expert. They were amazed how just his starting stance seemed to hold such depth and profoundness.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the previous generations, reaching ancestor level was already a formidable feat. Qing Shui’s level in Taichi Fists were already in the “Mixed Heaven” level. Every aspect of his Taichi form expressed a profoundly simple grace; even if they had a semblance of lightness and powerlessness, the impact of each blow caused a change in the general Qi field. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui regulated his deep breaths.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui appeared to the others as a sturdy, powerful warrior. Interspersed with the “softness” was an undefeatable aura. His form was not beautiful but was instead natural and magnanimous.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were many people at the public square. Some of them were not even from Heavenly Palace, but they were a minority. After all, this was the public square in Starmoon Hall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the past, many people did not understand why Qing Shui chose to practice such a slow fist technique every day, which led many to slander him. Once Qing Shui had defeated the nine talent disciples at Sword Tower and Xi Ri, he had become famous.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From that time, Gongsun Jianyun and the others started to practice that slow fist technique. They had to admire Gongsun Jianyun’s insight.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The surrounding crowd got larger.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go. Let’s hurry to Lingxiao Treasure Hall. We must find a good seat. The Six Sects Tournament is starting soon. If we are late, we won’t be able to see a thing.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. We can’t miss this Six Sects Tournament that only happens every few years. If we watch it this time, it could save our lives. Watch closely and try to learn as much as you can.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly cooled down. He suddenly felt an odd presence of Qi. He turned and saw someone he did not expect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xi Ri!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you interested in watching the tournament?” In this rare occasion, it was Xi Ri who started to talk first as he smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His abilities had improved significantly. This was the benefit of having a determined mentality.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!” Qing Shui replied with a smile as he looked at Gongsun Jianyun.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big Brother Qing Shui, it’s okay. Both of you should go. I will follow in a bit.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded and headed to Lingxing Treasure Hall with Xi Ri at his side.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You will join the sparring.” Xi Ri looked to a distance as he spoke.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You too.” Qing Shui replied plainly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can feel a murderous intent. I think that this isn’t like you.” Xi Ri laughed, revealing his set of white teeth.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The person standing in front of him had a sunny, handsome appearance. Qing Shui did not expect that he would chase after someone like the Misty Hall Mistress, but he knew that it would only leave Xi Ri full of wounds. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am here to kill someone, but I am not sure if he will be present.” Qing Shui said with a faint smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xi Ri did not continue the conversation. He knew from Qing Shui’s tone what it meant and decided to keep his silence.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they reached Lingxiao Treasure Hall, they found that there were people everywhere. Most of them were heading towards the public square. Luckily, there was still a passageway for people to enter and exit.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just after a few steps, Qing Shui noticed that many eyes were on him. Qing Shui smiled awkwardly and looked at Xi Ri, who was beside him. Originally, Qing Shui may not be recognized that quickly, but he was beside such an eye-catching person.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Look, Isn’t that Xi Ri?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes. He is still so handsome and stylish.” A beautiful, matured lady swooned.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“ I heard that his skills have improved tremendously.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ve heard about that too!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hey, who is that person beside Xi Ri?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Birds of a feather flock together. That man is quite young, but he seems as charming as Xi Ri. How could I have missed a man of such flavor!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That is Qing Shui…”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui...”&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was about to close the door, Yan Ling’er quickly slipped in. Qing Shui was startled to a halt for a moment before he close the door. He turned to look at Yan Ling’er.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What are you doing? I am tired, and I want to rest.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, you are tired. Then, you can just sleep. Just ignore me. I want to just take a look around here.” Yan Ling’er blinked her pair of innocent-looking eyes twice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at those innocent eyes. Even though he knew she was faking it, his heart softened. She was a very proud girl, so it must have taken a lot of courage for her to do this. Even he might not have the courage to do such a thing himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, I did not know that things were this way. You and auntie must have suffered all these years.” Yan Ling’er immediately knew she had made a mistake once she said that. She looked at Qing Shui anxiously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She found that Qing Shui was not angry. Up until now, Qing Shui knew that the other branches of the Yan Clan were just helpless victims of the incident. He did not want to hold on to those grudges stubbornly, since, after all, those members of the Yan Clan were all dead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Fine, since you want to stay here, then go ahead. I am going to rest first!” Qing Shui said to Yan Ling’er wearily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling’er nodded her head cheerfully. Even though Qing Shui did not seem friendly now, she knew that things were changing and that Qing Shui’s hatred towards her had lessened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Night came and the moonlight shone into the room. Qing Shui came out from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He could not fall asleep at the moment. He had reached the 143th cycle of his Ancient Strengthening Technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was easier to reach a breakthrough now. He just had to accumulate enough power to reach the breakthrough. During this period of time, Qing Shui’s strength had risen unbelievably fast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This rate of growth would only plateau at the 179th cycle, so Qing Shui needed to improve as quickly as possible and try to shorten the time required. Once he reaches the 180th cycle, the rate at which he’d achieve breakthroughs would fall again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that once he reaches the 179th cycle, his capabilities would improve vastly. With this increase, he had a feeling more dangers would crop up ahead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood by the window while looking at the quiet and boundless starry sky. The skies were sprinkled with twinkling stars that shone gently beside the full moon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Qing Shui had never thought of going back. When he first arrived in the World of the Nine continents, he was a little apprehensive. But when he saw Qing Yi’s hopeful gaze, he gradually got used to this world. After all, he experienced growing up here and witnessed his mother’s love. When he was a baby, instead of the blank state that all infants had, he slowly observed how great his mother’s love was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“When the sun rises, it will be the first day of the Six Sects tournament.” The moonlight cast a reflection in Qing Shui’s eyes. Qing Shui looked at the distant skies and felt a little despondent. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tan Yang. You better not appear on the battle stage. Don’t let me see you.” Qing Shui closed his eyes sadly. He forced himself not to think of Mingyue Gelou and Little Yuchang.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could feel that these repressed emotions were tearing his heart apart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The next day, Qing Shui went to the public square for his morning practice. He found Gongsun Jianyun and a large group of people practising their Taichi Fist solemnly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was surprised to find that many of them had already gotten the knack for Taichi and were able to express the grace of Taichi. There are a few like Gongsun Jianyun who have already reached the master level of the technique.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was silently amazed by Gongsun Jianyun. He had a high natural aptitude and could be considered a genius of the Starmoon Hall before he met Qing Shui. Unfortunately, Qing Shui’s prestige had totally buried his.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big Brother Qing Shui!” Gongsun Jianyun spotted Qing Shui and ran over in surprise.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; “Big Brother QIng Shui！”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; “Big Brother QIng Shui！”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Many of them had spoken to Qing Shui before, so they came over to greet him. They looked at Qing Shui with a lot of admiration and respect. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Since when was I so close with them?” Qing Shui gave Gongsun Jianyun a puzzled look. To not make things difficult, Qing Shui reciprocated by smiling at them in a friendly manner. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, when did you come back?” Gongsun Jianyun asked unceremoniously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Age could make someone old, and age could also make someone more mature. Qing Shui could see the apparent change in Gongsun Jianyun’s demeanor. His image had totally changed, he was no longer that proud and haughty playboy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I came back yesterday. All of you wake up really early!” Qing Shui replied with a smile as he slowly went into the starting Taichi pose.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they saw that Qing Shui was beginning his practice, they quietly backed off. It was indeed easy to spot an expert. They were amazed how just his starting stance seemed to hold such depth and profoundness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the previous generations, reaching ancestor level was already a formidable feat. Qing Shui’s level in Taichi Fists were already in the “Mixed Heaven” level. Every aspect of his Taichi form expressed a profoundly simple grace; even if they had a semblance of lightness and powerlessness, the impact of each blow caused a change in the general Qi field. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui regulated his deep breaths.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui appeared to the others as a sturdy, powerful warrior. Interspersed with the “softness” was an undefeatable aura. His form was not beautiful but was instead natural and magnanimous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were many people at the public square. Some of them were not even from Heavenly Palace, but they were a minority. After all, this was the public square in Starmoon Hall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the past, many people did not understand why Qing Shui chose to practice such a slow fist technique every day, which led many to slander him. Once Qing Shui had defeated the nine talent disciples at Sword Tower and Xi Ri, he had become famous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From that time, Gongsun Jianyun and the others started to practice that slow fist technique. They had to admire Gongsun Jianyun’s insight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The surrounding crowd got larger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go. Let’s hurry to Lingxiao Treasure Hall. We must find a good seat. The Six Sects Tournament is starting soon. If we are late, we won’t be able to see a thing.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. We can’t miss this Six Sects Tournament that only happens every few years. If we watch it this time, it could save our lives. Watch closely and try to learn as much as you can.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly cooled down. He suddenly felt an odd presence of Qi. He turned and saw someone he did not expect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Xi Ri!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you interested in watching the tournament?” In this rare occasion, it was Xi Ri who started to talk first as he smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His abilities had improved significantly. This was the benefit of having a determined mentality.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!” Qing Shui replied with a smile as he looked at Gongsun Jianyun.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big Brother Qing Shui, it’s okay. Both of you should go. I will follow in a bit.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded and headed to Lingxing Treasure Hall with Xi Ri at his side.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You will join the sparring.” Xi Ri looked to a distance as he spoke.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You too.” Qing Shui replied plainly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can feel a murderous intent. I think that this isn’t like you.” Xi Ri laughed, revealing his set of white teeth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The person standing in front of him had a sunny, handsome appearance. Qing Shui did not expect that he would chase after someone like the Misty Hall Mistress, but he knew that it would only leave Xi Ri full of wounds. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am here to kill someone, but I am not sure if he will be present.” Qing Shui said with a faint smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Xi Ri did not continue the conversation. He knew from Qing Shui’s tone what it meant and decided to keep his silence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they reached Lingxiao Treasure Hall, they found that there were people everywhere. Most of them were heading towards the public square. Luckily, there was still a passageway for people to enter and exit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just after a few steps, Qing Shui noticed that many eyes were on him. Qing Shui smiled awkwardly and looked at Xi Ri, who was beside him. Originally, Qing Shui may not be recognized that quickly, but he was beside such an eye-catching person.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Look, Isn’t that Xi Ri?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes. He is still so handsome and stylish.” A beautiful, matured lady swooned.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“ I heard that his skills have improved tremendously.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ve heard about that too!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hey, who is that person beside Xi Ri?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Birds of a feather flock together. That man is quite young, but he seems as charming as Xi Ri. How could I have missed a man of such flavor!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That is Qing Shui…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui...”&nbsp;</p>
