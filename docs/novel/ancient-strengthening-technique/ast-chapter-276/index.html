 <p><strong>Chapter 276 Unique Physique.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 276 - Unique Physique</strong></p>
  <p><span style>“Mingyue, do you wish to join the Heavenly Palace?” The three of them ate some stuff on the back of the fire bird as Qing Shui casually asked. There was only about five days till they reached the ‘central region’ of the Greencloud Capital. Not only that, Qing Shui’s Ancient Strengthening Technique, had already reached the 93rd cycle and the breakthrough of each cycle, cause his strength to undergo an obvious increase.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although the strength gained from every breakthrough of every minor cycle wasn’t that much, if the strength gain were all accumulated, it would still be extremely shocking!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“En, actually if that thing didn’t happen, my father would also want me to join the Heavenly Palace.” Canghai Mingyue said in a low voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui gazed at Huoyun Liu-Li, at this moment Liu-Li was as though lost in her thoughts. Qing Shui gently shook her, “What are you so engrossed about, do you have any plans Liu-Li?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li glanced at Qing Shui, before glancing at Canghai Mingyue, before finally saying, “Qing Shui, do you want to join the Heavenly Palace? So it seems that even when she was lost in her thoughts, she had still heard the conversation between Qing Shui and Mingyue.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“After I send Mingyue to the Heavenly Palace, I’m going to return. I still have something very important I have to accomplish. After finishing that, I’ll come back to look for you all again.” Qing Shui passively replied.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words caused Canghai Mingyue to be stunned. She and Huoyun Liu-Li knew what was the important thing Qing Shui wanted to do. Canghai Mingyue’s thoughts instantly became a whirl, disconcerted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let me go with you then, I miss home!” Huoyun Liu-Li lightly added.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui initially wanted Huoyun Liu-Li to remain behind so she could accompany Canghai Mingyue, but when Huoyun Liu-Li said she missed home, Qing Shui also didn’t know what to reply at that moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It could be considered that they’re entering into the ‘Central Region’, after leaving the Southern City. The strongest clans and sect of the Greencloud continent are all located in the Central Region. This place were where the spiritual qi of Heavens and Earth were the most abundant, and the bases of these great powers would usually be located near mountains and oceans, rather than within the bustling cities.</span></p>
  <p><span style>And for their bases, they would usually select a region where there were ‘spiritual roots’ buried within. Treasure lands with spiritual roots allowed a cultivator to gain twice the results only with half the effort, and was able to increase the quality of their cultivation which will be of immense help to cultivators trying to break through.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could sense that the atmosphere here was even more bustling than that of the Southern City. The Central Region was akin to a gigantic coiling dragon, with no hints of ostentatiousness, yet giving people a sense of heavy pressure.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Legends said that there would be an exceptionally powerful guardian beast for each of the nine continents, but no one has seen them before. No one knew of their appearances, what they were guarding, etc.. Even the legends regarding these mystical beasts were extremely obscure.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was stunned, Canghai Mingyue would usually never call his name directly. He glanced at the desolate looking Canghai Mingyue with puzzlement in his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes Yueyue? Tell me what’s the matter, regardless of me jumping down a volcano or climbing up a hill of blades, even my life, I’m willing to give it to you.” Qing Shui didn’t know the reason why Canghai Mingyue called him, but he felt extremely upset when he saw the fragile appearance of Canghai Mingyue. In his heart, Canghai Mingyue was a goddess, a strong and prideful empress..</span></p>
  <p><span style>He would never have thought such a strong woman like Mingyue would have this side to her. Thinking of how she’s all alone now, Qing Shui sighed. At the very least, he still had his mom with him, as well as his clan members.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If he was all alone, that feeling of absolute helplessness was indeed incomparably terrifying. The greatest pain of humankind, was none other than loneliness.. a loneliness so deep that it seeps into one’s soul.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was struggling because he knew that there was a need to give Canghai Mingyue something to steady her. Only love or extreme hatred would allow one to break past loneliness. There were many powerful experts who had long life spans, eventually &nbsp;chose to seek death because of loneliness, and on the other hand, there were many others who chose to live because of either love or hatred!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If she can birth my child, she would definitely have the determination to live on!” Qing Shui wildly imagined.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, the three of them sat on the back of the fire bird. Huoyun Liu-Li hugged her knees with her hands, as she gazed off in the horizons in boredom. Qing Shui stared silently at the beautiful countenance of Canghai Mingyue. He had a very strong intuition that if Canghai Mingyue were to leave now, there was an extremely high probability that he will lose her forever. And at the moment where Canghai Mingyue opened her mouth to speak….</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui actually went forward, hugging her into his embrace, while his lips accurately sought hers out. Both of his hands were pressing the back of her shoulders, pressing her tighter into him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue didn’t even say anything before she found herself being hugged tightly by Qing Shui, not only that, her lips were being kissed. Her heartbeat quickened, and she even forgot to struggle.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui has already decided that no matter what, he would kiss her. For woman like Canghai Mingyue who never had such contact with guys before, as long as he kissed her, she would be transported into a mysterious realm. Thus, Qing Shui continued kissing her, locking onto her cherry lips, which represented his ‘monopoly’ over her. Qing Shui didn’t intend for her to fall in love with him because of the kisses but rather, he wanted her to hate him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hatred and Love are all two sides of the same coin, hatred when taken to the extreme, is also love!” Qing Shui didn’t know if this action of his would be capable of causing Canghai Mingyue to hate him, but he only did so because he didn’t want Canghai Mingyue to forget him, he wanted to be a flame flickering inside her heart, amidst the darkness of the heavy loneliness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, when Qing Shui was kissing Canghai Mingyue, an extremely fascinating feeling caused Qing Shui to forget everything else. That soft feeling of touch, as well as the gentle waft of fragrance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He suddenly thought of the portraits of beauty.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Could Canghai Mingyue be one of the divine bodies?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue clumsily avoided Qing Shui’s tongue, but where could her tongue hide in her small and dainty mouth? On the contrary, her struggles caused Qing Shui’s tongue to fully probe the inside of her mouth with his licking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hugging her, both his hands were caressing her non-stop from behind, Qing Shui felt the skin of her back, as well as the exquisite structure of her bones.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue, who was aroused, quickly pushed Qing Shui away. Qing Shui stared at Canghai Mingyue in a state of slight panic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With a reddened face and misty eyes, her slightly swollen lips contained a trace of sexiness, and even though her raven black hair were slightly messed up, it didn’t diminish any of her beauty.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, Canghai Mingyue complicatedly stared at Qing Shui. Qing Shui had never thought it was possible for a woman’s gaze to be so complicated, as hesitation could be seen flickering in her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mingyue…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t need to say anything more, I want some peace and quiet.” After speaking, she summoned the condor as she leapt over to it’s back.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, you are terrible!” Huoyun Liu-Li after returning to her senses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, “......”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Only Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li remained on the back of the fire bird. Qing Shui commanded the fire bird to follow the golden winged condor, his heart now was in shambles, although he was prepared to let Canghai Mingyue hate him forever, which man would be able to bear it if a girl he loved really hated himself? </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you feel terrible?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Terrible…” Qing Shui sighed awkwardly!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you want me to help you? WIth my help, you would definitely be able to hug sister Mingyue home.” Huoyun Liu-Li charming eyes were filled with laughter as she gazed at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Little Demoness, are you jealous!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui chortled as he swiftly lunged over to Huoyun Liu-Li! In any case, Qing Shui didn’t have any intentions to let Huoyun Liu-Li off.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, what are you trying to do!” Liu-Li shrieked in shock, this was the first time a man was pressing himself down on her. She was extremely nervous in her heart, and shrieks of startlement couldn’t help but to escape from her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The nefarious fire in his loins earlier has yet to dissipate, and currently when he pressed down the exquisite body together with the soft and elastic twin peaks, the embers flared again as he tore off Huoyun Liu-Li’s veil.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui… I’m not prepared yet, and this place isn't convenient…” Huoyun Liu-Li pulled at Qing Shui’s sleeves as she trembled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A single sentence almost caused Qing Shui to lose control, as the thought of stripping her, enjoying the carnal pleasure between man and woman right away flashed in his mind. However, he just kissed Canghai Mingyue, and if would be weird if sex really were to happen between him and Huoyun Liu-Li now. Not only that, if Canghai Mingyue turn back halfway, even if he jumped down into a river, there was no way he would be able to explain himself. Thus initially, Qing Shui didn’t really have the intentions to f*** her, it was just her earlier statement that caused Qing Shui to almost lose himself to his desires.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“Hatred and Love are all two sides of the same coin, hatred when taken to the extreme, is also love!” Qing Shui didn’t know if this action of his would be capable of causing Canghai Mingyue to hate him, but he only did so because he didn’t want Canghai Mingyue to forget him, he wanted to be a flame flickering inside her heart, amidst the darkness of the heavy loneliness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Qing Shui was kissing Canghai Mingyue, an extremely fascinating feeling caused Qing Shui to forget everything else. That soft feeling of touch, as well as the gentle waft of fragrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly thought of the portraits of beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could Canghai Mingyue be one of the divine bodies?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue clumsily avoided Qing Shui’s tongue, but where could her tongue hide in her small and dainty mouth? On the contrary, her struggles caused Qing Shui’s tongue to fully probe the inside of her mouth with his licking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hugging her, both his hands were caressing her non-stop from behind, Qing Shui felt the skin of her back, as well as the exquisite structure of her bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue, who was aroused, quickly pushed Qing Shui away. Qing Shui stared at Canghai Mingyue in a state of slight panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a reddened face and misty eyes, her slightly swollen lips contained a trace of sexiness, and even though her raven black hair were slightly messed up, it didn’t diminish any of her beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Canghai Mingyue complicatedly stared at Qing Shui. Qing Shui had never thought it was possible for a woman’s gaze to be so complicated, as hesitation could be seen flickering in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mingyue…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to say anything more, I want some peace and quiet.” After speaking, she summoned the condor as she leapt over to it’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, you are terrible!” Huoyun Liu-Li after returning to her senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui, “......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li remained on the back of the fire bird. Qing Shui commanded the fire bird to follow the golden winged condor, his heart now was in shambles, although he was prepared to let Canghai Mingyue hate him forever, which man would be able to bear it if a girl he loved really hated himself? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you feel terrible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Terrible…” Qing Shui sighed awkwardly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want me to help you? WIth my help, you would definitely be able to hug sister Mingyue home.” Huoyun Liu-Li charming eyes were filled with laughter as she gazed at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Demoness, are you jealous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui chortled as he swiftly lunged over to Huoyun Liu-Li! In any case, Qing Shui didn’t have any intentions to let Huoyun Liu-Li off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, what are you trying to do!” Liu-Li shrieked in shock, this was the first time a man was pressing himself down on her. She was extremely nervous in her heart, and shrieks of startlement couldn’t help but to escape from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nefarious fire in his loins earlier has yet to dissipate, and currently when he pressed down the exquisite body together with the soft and elastic twin peaks, the embers flared again as he tore off Huoyun Liu-Li’s veil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui… I’m not prepared yet, and this place isn't convenient…” Huoyun Liu-Li pulled at Qing Shui’s sleeves as she trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single sentence almost caused Qing Shui to lose control, as the thought of stripping her, enjoying the carnal pleasure between man and woman right away flashed in his mind. However, he just kissed Canghai Mingyue, and if would be weird if sex really were to happen between him and Huoyun Liu-Li now. Not only that, if Canghai Mingyue turn back halfway, even if he jumped down into a river, there was no way he would be able to explain himself. Thus initially, Qing Shui didn’t really have the intentions to f*** her, it was just her earlier statement that caused Qing Shui to almost lose himself to his desires.</span></p>
