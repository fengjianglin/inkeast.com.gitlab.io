 <p><strong>AST 1421 - Meeting the Blue Dragon, Immortal Demons Jewel, War</strong></p>
 <p>“Maybe. You seem to like him a lot,” said the woman slowly, as she once again glanced at Qing Shui in the distance.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei laughed distractedly. He and Demon Lord addressed each other in an odd way. One used “Milady”, the other just “you” but neither had ever discussed relationships between men and women before.</p>
 <p>So when Demon Lord suddenly brought up the topic, she got distracted but she laughed, “ I do like him but not that kind of like. Does not Milady like him too?”</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei looked craftily at the Demon Lord but Demon Lord shook her head without any change in expression, “ I don’t like him”</p>
 <p>“Did you know he likes you? Apparently he even came here for you,” Hua Rumei thought aloud. Even though they had never discussed these topics, she would occasionally tease her.</p>
 <p>“ You don’t understand. Stop talking about him.”</p>
 <p>Meal time was a sumptuous affair but was lacking a little compared with the night before. One should eat a smaller breakfast, as a habit.</p>
 <p>After the meal, the two ladies naturally began washing the dishes. Qing Shui enjoyed the atmosphere, watching both ladies performing the simplest of tasks; but seemingly viewing the greatest tasks being performed on the continent</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A loud sound rang out, as if it were a deadly shout. Qing Shui looked at the two ladies. Hua Rumei’s expression changed slightly, with her perfectly beautiful brow wrinkling slightly, then turning towards the direction of the sound.</p>
 <p>Hidden Dragon Mountain!</p>
 <p>“This is Hidden Dragon Mountain,” Qing Shui heard Hua Rumei say as though it were nothing out of ordinary. Legend has it that dragons existed but were never seen before and now actually meeting one. What luck...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as though he were a person wandering the wilderness alone, yet suddenly having had dog poop dumped on his head. An astronomically tiny possibility but one that could not be avoided.</p>
 <p>“That sound indicates a mature dragon,” the woman said aloud, proactively for the first time.</p>
 <p>“What do we do, run?” Hua Rumei asked.</p>
 <p>“Looks like we won’t be able to make it, this area has been sealed. If we want to leave, we will have to break his restrictions.” The woman looked at peace, no trace of panic or agitation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as though he was confined by the Nine Continents. This had escalated too much. The only hope left was to defeat the dragon that had yet to appear.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Another resounding dragon roar. Qing Shui then saw a massive beast flying towards them, fast as lightning. In the time it took to blink several times, it had flown into the distance.</p>
 <p>During that time, Demon Lord had summoned that same enormous Divine Turtle.</p>
 <p>Roarrrrr!</p>
 <p>Old Turtle, now the Divine Turtle, dared not show weakness. Even though the Turtle did not sound so old now, it was still old. Then again, Turtles’ longevity was frighteningly long, easily living to ten thousand years of age. This was a true 10,000 year Turtle, unlike the legends of the past.</p>
 <p>This was a blue dragon, a real life member of the race of dragons. At least it was a real dragon. It’s bloodline, however, wasn’t as precious as the others. The most precious were the green dragon, followed by the gold dragon and the legendary Dragon Goddess, however those were just legends</p>
 <p>The enormous being in front of them was over seven hundred meters long. Even with all the gigantic beasts Qing Shui had met, this was still quite a large creature. In his mind’s eye, his image of the creature, although a reflection of reality, paled in comparison to the actual beast.</p>
 <p>Besides, this was a real dragon, one fully matured. This divine looking beast was one of the strongest creatures in existence.</p>
 <p>Old Turtle was big too but with a different body shape. In comparison, it looked a little smaller than the blue dragon.</p>
 <p>Blue dragons specialized in frost elements, green dragons in nature elements, red dragons in fire elements, black dragons in poison elements…...</p>
 <p>“Since you have intruded into my territory, you will remain here!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A metallic sounding voice rang out. With all the weirdness going on, not being able to communicate would be weirdest.</p>
 <p>Boundless energy overwhelmed and saturated the area. Qing Shui, seeing the two women speechless, spoke up, “ We were just passing through. We meant no disrespect and apologise for any disturbance caused. Please let us go.”</p>
 <p>“You may leave. As long as he leaves the Pearl of Immortals and Demons behind, then will I let you go.” Blue Dragon suddenly turned toward Old Turtle.</p>
 <p>“Pearl of Immortals and Demons? What’s that?”</p>
 <p>“When a demonic beast reaches the state of an immortal demon, it slowly forms a jewel, created by condensing it’s essence, infused with it’s own vitality,” Hua Rumei explained to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I knew their race was greedy, looks like its true. He should have his own Pearl of Immortals and Demons right?” Qing Shui looked at Hua Rumei questioningly.</p>
 <p>“Yes, and it should be one of the best.” Hua Rumei smiled as she said that.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t we take his Pearl of Immortals and Demons for Old Master Turtle?” A divine turtle was still a turtle. A real divine turtle did not lose out to a dragon, only that Old Turtle just attained this state.</p>
 <p>“We should focus on protecting ourselves. We can’t win against him, all we can do is look for a chance to escape.” Hua Rumei looked unfazed.</p>
 <p>“Since he won’t let us go, we might as well try fighting.” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
 <p>“Impudent little brat, would you dare to take my Immortal Demon Jewel? Can you afford to antagonize the dragons?” Blue Dragon’s voice rang out with disdain.</p>
 <p>“If I have to antagonize them, then so be it. Do you expect me to stand here and do nothing?” Qing Shui faced the leviathan with the metallic sounding voice that numbed his ear</p>
 <p>“Then try to take it!”</p>
 <p>After saying so, Blue Dragon’s enormous body shot ahead suddenly, barreling towards Qing Shui. Even though he was moving towards Qing Shui, the other three people and Old Turtle were in his sights as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was about to move, when a sudden mystical energy enveloped him. He wanted to resist, yet in his ear was a female voice, “Don’t move, dodge it first!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui managed to dodge the next attack. It was miraculous, a lot like the Nine Continent Steps, while also like the Square Steps. The Old Turtle, however, raced towards the blue dragon.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>With the sound of the earth cracking, Old Turtle’s huge body rebounded without much damage, due to his powerful defense.</p>
 <p>“How was it” Qing Shui said to Old Turtle.</p>
 <p>“This was the most basic of attacks and I was struggling. If I used the power of the Immortal Demon Jewel, it would be unstoppable. The difference is too much.” Old Turtle’s voice rang out, a metallic sounding voice tinged with worry.</p>
 <p>“No matter, I’ll add something to it.”</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon shot towards them again, as though they were not worthy of his gaze.</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds worshipping the Phoenix!</p>
 <p>No effect!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose. Without enough training, the most violent path would be a killer’s trump card.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Roarrrr!</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon cried out, seemingly enraged. In a matter of minutes, it was weakened by 20%. It was terrifying.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know how powerful the blue dragon was but with one strike, Qing Shui knew. Blue Dragon had about 65 million sun. One strike had left it about 50 million sun.</p>
 <p>The specialty of the dragon race was that their strength and ** were especially terrifying. For example, the dragon in front of them had close to 70 million sun. Using 10 million sun couldn’t even hurt it, let alone kill it.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Old Turtle blocked again, this time with better success. It wasn’t as bad as the last time. With this magnitude of an attack, Old Turtle could still last a while.</p>
 <p>Roarrrr!</p>
 <p>“You have angered me. Ultimate Frost!”</p>
 <p>Blue Dragon suddenly roared, spitting out a sheet of azure ice to envelop all.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Laws!</p>
 <p>In the Nine Palace, He is the King! Nine Yang Fire, Primordial Flames, BREAK!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swiftly took a few steps forward. A mysterious air rose around, blanketing a large area.</p>
 <p>“Nine Palace positionings?” the woman exclaimed in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, he taught me too, said it was the Nine Palace Steps,” Hua Rumei said as she looked at Demon Lord</p>
 <p>An enormous piece of ice covered the area, except where Qing Shui and the others stood. A strong blast of heat melted the huge ice piece.</p>
 <p>Nine Yang Fire was the Qi of the sun, and Primordial Flames was far in excess of even that. Even though water beats fire, a hot fire burning in a small area can still work.</p>
 <p>If not for Qing Shui’s intervention, if they were trapped in the ice, with their current abilities, they would not have been able to escape. Qing Shui did not know how powerful Old Turtle and Demon Lord were but they were definitely as powerful as Blue Dragon.</p>
 <p>In fact, Old Turtle was probably slightly more powerful.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>With a loud sound, the enormous ice piece shattered into slurry. Blue Dragon, having realized the ice couldn't harm them, decided to simply destroy the icy prison and filled the air with icy flame.</p>
 <p>Divine Protection!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Demon Lord waved her hands and summoned a pure white circle of light to surround the others. The icy flame vanished upon touching the light.</p>
 <p>This was Demon Lord’s ultimate defensive technique. It was sustainable for a brief moment but limited to one use a day.</p>
 <p>The three of them were relatively safe for now. However, the defensive barrier wasn’t perfect, being able to deflect only 60% of the attack. The three, however, were perfectly in sync, allowing them to completely defend against the attack.</p>
 <p>The weakened icy flames at 40% power quickly rushed towards them.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Battle Intent!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used this moment to unleash a powerful technique. Even though it wasn’t a move, as long as Qing Shui wanted, he could cast it indefinitely.</p>
 <p>Although it only amplified 10% of power, due to the hail of icy flame, fire and poison, it was very effective.</p>
 <p>This diminished the weakened icy flame to barely 10% power.</p>
 <p>Both women felt a 10% increase in power. They looked at Qing Shui in amazement. They felt the original diminishing in power but without a powerful attack, a 10% increase in power was still pretty scary, especially with the diminishing of the opponent’s power. This was what 10% of power could do.</p>
 <p>Old Turtle’s power increased the most.</p>
 <p>Golden Sword!</p>
 <p>With an outstretched hand,, Qing Shui sent a golden sword straight into the eye of Blue Dragon with frightening speed.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Laws directly enveloped Blue Dragon, not only weighing it down but sapping its strength as well.</p>
 <p>“Prepare to fight!” Qing Shui said as he looked at &nbsp;Demon Lord and Hua Rumei.</p>
 <p>“Can we?” Hua Rumei asked with suspicion.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it. With Old Turtle in the front and the three of them as support, it should not be a problem.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t think Old Turtle could kill easily. Now with Old Turtle’s power being equivalent to Blue Dragon, along with the power of the two women and himself, they should be able to defeat this lowly blue dragon.</p>
