 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2289 - Chi Clan in The Eight Desert Region</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are doing well and were raised by a village head in the mountains. I met them when I visited the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, and they lived a blissful life. When I met them, I was surprised at their innate gifts, albeit the strong evil spirit surrounding them. Thus, I forged a jade pendant for them and taught them certain battle skills to help them suppress the evil spirits. At that point of time, they were only teenagers,” Qing Shui said as he recalled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened after that?” Chi Yang asked. He wanted nothing more than to know about his children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At that point of time, we agreed that if they wanted to cultivate, they had to practice what I taught them first and come to look for me ten years later. After ten years, I was still residing in the Greencloud Continent when they really came to look for me. They’ve been living with me ever since. I have never thought that I would meet mister here...” Qing Shui sighed with emotion. This was truly a miracle. Some things were just that coincidental, such as lovers in his previous life would discover that they were long-lost siblings...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this world, there were too many coincidences. This was one of the things he kept in mind. There was also Qing Sha whose pernicious, evil aura was even stronger than Chi Feng and Chi Ao’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could I go see them?” Chi Ao thought for a long time, struggling internally as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Has the threat been eradicated?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang let out a sigh and nodded his head, “Forget it, for them being able to live a good life is already the best outcome. It is best to not see them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finding out that the children were alive, Chi Yang was overjoyed. But he was afraid to welcome them back, even seeing them was hard for him. This agonized him, but he still said to Qing Shui, “You all are welcome to my humble abode to have a chat any day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui nodded his head. Even though Chi Ao and Chi Feng did not say anything, he knew that they wanted to know about their roots. Thus, Qing Shui began to think on how to let Chi Ao and Chi Feng return home and for the Chi Clan to settle down. So he nodded his head, “Sorry to bother you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No worries, thank you for taking care of them all these years,” Chi Yang said sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Both of them call me their father much like my own children, though they aren’t my flesh and blood. They really want to know their true parentage, as well as the reason they were abandoned,” Qing Shui lightly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang’s heart started to ache even more, and his face became pale. So many years had passed, and he had thought of his children countless times. His wife had also longed for their children, so much that her face was always stained with tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Chi Clan lived nearby, keeping a low profile in Hua City. Yet, no one dared to provoke them. They didn’t attend any events hosted by other powers either. As such, many families gradually started to view the Chi Clan as a very secretive family, warning their own people not to provoke them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Chi Clan’s manor was not very big, and there were no servants. Only Chi Yang and his wife were living there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Chi Clan was not massive, they had three courtyards and over a hundred rooms. The courtyard was paved using grey marble, with a bamboo forest at the left side and a pond at the right side. In the middle was a broad footpath that extended to the backyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Near the bamboo forest was a flower garden with a large plot of flowers. At that moment, a girl was tending to the plants. Her figure was elegant and exquisitely carved, with a gentle and dignified odor surrounding her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing the sounds of movement, she turned around and saw Chi Yang bring a crowd into the yard. She put down the shears and walked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her facial features were beautiful and charming, with a smooth forehead as white as snow which sent forth a noble aura. Qing Shui was startled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fate, mysterious concepts, Qing Shui felt like these things existed, but none of it was that simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re back! And they are...?” The woman spoke gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui could tell that this woman also had serious, hidden injuries. However, she was strong, even stronger than the Bu clan’s third uncle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll talk inside,” Chi Yang nodded his head and proceeded to walk into the biggest living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang himself prepared tea for the guests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following that, he introduced Qing Shui and relayed the story of Chi Ao and Chi Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the story, the woman teared up. Once Chi Yang was finished, the woman said, “I’ve missed them for so long... I really want to see them, but that’ll only hurt them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled as he took out a piece of paper and a golden pen. He began to draw. Very quickly, portraits of Chi Ao and Chi Feng were drawn. Qing Shui did not simply draw one drawing; instead, he recalled the first time he met them and how their relationship progressed until now, resulting in him creating ten drawings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang and the woman looked on attentively. Looking at each drawing, the woman’s hand started to tremble while her tears rolled down uncontrollably. On the other hand, although Chi Yang did not tear up, the pain in his eyes was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother, thank you for taking care of them for so many years,” said the woman sincerely as she bowed to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui quickly held on to her, “Sister, you’ll get to meet them soon, don’t be upset.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman’s face reflected shock and happiness, but she quickly shook her head and said, “I’m afraid that meeting them would only hurt them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui laughed, “Previously, I heard brother mentioning about Eight Desolates Region. You all were probably from there. If you believe me, I will help you reinstate the Chi Family’s prestige and honor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Qing Shui, a joyful and startled expression could be seen all over his face. However, in the end, he still said, “The opponents are extremely powerful within the Lower Three Regions; they are at the pinnacle. As of now, we still haven’t recovered from our hidden injuries, and our strength cannot be compared to them. They have strength in numbers, with many strong individuals. Reinstating the Chi Clan’s honor is practically impossible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are some things that are dependent on human’s effort. If one does not put in the best effort to achieve something, how would one know if it is possible or not? Brother and sister are still young, although I do not know much about the three regions, I have a feeling that your strength was previously one of the strongest in the Lower Three Regions!” Qing Shui guffawed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sky-Obstructing Crow had evaluated him to be able to enter the first four regions, so the ones that could suppress him in the Lower Three Regions would be few, and his special skills would probably allow him to massacre experts here. The only danger would be the super experts who were living in seclusion there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our injuries are extremely severe. Originally, our strength was already inferior to the opponents. If we confronted them now, we’d be instantly killed. Moreover, there aren’t any forces within the Lower Three Regions that are willing to offend them. An iron will is insufficient sometimes, even a single setback can spell infinite damnation.” Chi Yang said bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your injuries are not a problem. I can cure you, and even help your cultivation improve. I just do not know if you all, the Chi Clan, have reunited with each other yet. Originally, the Chi Clan was a great force in the region, I don’t think that all of you have been wiped out!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang was stunned at this sudden promise of salvation. This succession of happy surprises came a bit out of the blue, and it was slightly difficult for him to accept. However, he could not verify this claim. He thought for a second, before saying: “Some of the Chi Clan members know nothing about my location, or else they’d already be here trying to restore the clan.”</span></p>
