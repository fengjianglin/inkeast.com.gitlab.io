 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2318 - Beihuang Fan</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui really wanted to make them his women right at that moment, but he knew that it was not the right thing to do. It was a little unfair to take them both in this manner for their first time, so Qing Shui held it in. They should be spending a separate, ‘private lesson’ with him for something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Neither of the ladies replied and Qing Shui didn't continue, letting them heave a sigh of relief. If Qing Shui were to insist on taking them here, they wouldn't be able to say no, either. However, they would still feel a little uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After helping the two ladies with their clothes, Qing Shui brought the two of them out to take a stroll around the Eight Desolates City. He noticed that it had been a very long time since he had gone out to take a stroll along the streets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only after coming to this world that Qing Shui knew what taking a walk on the streets really meant. The streets here were how streets should be like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things in town remained as usual. It wouldn't change just because the Chi Clan had some kind of problems with others. Regardless of the rise and fall of the great forces, it wouldn't change the lives of ordinary people at all. The world would continue to move just like any other day. Before nature and the entire world, no matter how powerful a Clan was, they would still be small and insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Look, that's the young man from the Chi Clan. It's said that he killed someone from the Divine Rain Sect," voices rang out from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Those two ladies are so beautiful, just like goddesses," said a man, his eyes losing the ability to blink all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hu Liuzi, be careful. You'll be beaten to death one day if you continue to stare at women like this," A female voice chided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's better for everyone to steer clear of this person. No one whom the Divine Rain Sect targets has ever managed to get away. It's a pity. Not only him will face the storm, but the entire Chi Clan would be pulled in as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's such a pity for these two beauties. I wonder if they'll die too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui and the two ladies weren't interested in other people's discussions at all. They continued to walk on. Suddenly, Qing Shui's Spiritual Sense stirred and he looked toward a spot. A lady was standing there and looking at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had a slender waist, a well-rounded bosom and protruding chests. She had a demonic figure and although her beauty might not be comparable to that of Beihuang Fan and Shen Huang, she emitted a kind of indescribable elegance. The Charm was fatal for her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bu Clan's Young Miss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui hadn't expected the Bu Clan's Young Miss to be here. He thought of how she had been Wu Xingyun's fiancée, and then, how Wu Xingyun had already died. Last time, he had asked if she would be a beauty with a tragic end, but now it really seemed to come true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Qing Shui was looking at her, the Bu Clan's Young Miss smiled and then turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bu Clan's Young Miss felt a hint of guilt. She was from the Divine Rain Sect but she didn't wish to get married to Wu Xingyun. However, Wu Xingyun's Master had made a marriage proposal for Wu Xingyun to her Master. Wu Xingyun's Master was stronger than her Master. No matter the reason, her Master would still have to agree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to get out of this marriage proposal, she had to resort to some tricks. Back then, she saw that Qing Shui was so strong that she had given it a push. She hoped that Qing Shui would have a feud with the Wu Clan and even kill Wu Xingyun. She hadn't expected that all her hopes had been realized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was a member of the Divine Rain Sect and between her and Qing Shui, there could only be enmity. She had reached her goals and she was now the Bu Clan's Young Miss, the Divine Rain Sect's disciple, and a proud daughter of the heavens...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui would probably have never expected that this beautiful Young Miss had done him in. If Wu Tianchou could’ve returned to the Wu Clan back then, then things might have turned out differently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That night, Qing Shui snuck into Beihuang Fan's room when the night was still young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman's door wasn't locked. After all, it wasn't too late yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Qing Shui's entrance, Beihuang Fan's face turned a little red. It seemed that she recalled the scene between the three of them earlier and had thought of how Qing Shui told them to leave their doors unlocked for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew that she would become his woman tonight. It wasn't that she was unwilling, but she was still feeling a little nervous. She stared at Qing Shui; her eyes looked a little out of it. She clearly overthought and her face turned crimson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll feel embarrassed when you look at me like this. Tonight, I'll become yours. You must be gentle..." Qing Shui walked over and buried his face in her arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan was both embarrassed and angry. This guy was really too shameless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't care for it... Mmmm!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan had just started to say something when she felt a numb feeling in her chest. Qing Shui sucked on the pearl at the tip through her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Damn!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan was caught by surprise, and her body turned weak as though she had been shocked by electricity. She instantly turned extremely red, feeling both embarrassed and awkward. She instinctively wanted to push him away but saw that Qing Shui was hugging her very close. Even if she wanted to push him away, it wasn't easy. Moreover, she was already prepared to become his woman tonight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan turned weak and shook continuously from Qing Shui's sucking. She couldn't even stand properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was really shameless and enjoyed the sucking. Not only did he refuse to let go, but he even deliberately made sucking sounds. His rhythmic motions and the sound made Beihuang Fan's heart beat very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmmm!" Beihuang Fan's mind turned blank. Although she was a virgin, human nature was like this. It was one's instincts, an ability that all ordinary women would have. Moreover, she had been with Qing Shui for very long, and they had previously had some intimate contact as well. She couldn’t help but let out a cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked down at this man she loved, her face flushed. His calm face gave her an indescribable feeling. He also felt a lot of pressure...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan stretched out her hand to slowly stroke this handsome face as she looked at this man who had barged into her life. She had thought that she would never marry in this lifetime. She was a woman who would rather give up totally rather than making sacrifices. She didn't want to make herself feel grief over this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew a lot of things about Qing Shui. One could imagine how much pain Qing Shui had gone through to reach the height he was at today. The heavens wouldn't give something to him for free, and the heavens wouldn't only dote on a single person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan had no idea how much of a price he had paid, what sacrifices he had made, and how much blood he had bled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was unlike her who had quite a good family; her path had always been smooth-sailing. Although there were pains as well, they were different from the pain what he had been through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Beihuang Fan was thinking about a lot of things, Qing Shui spoke, "Woman, how dare you be out of it at a time like this! I'm going to punish you harshly!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui stood up abruptly, sweeping her off her feet and headed for the bedroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ahhh, you rascal. What are you going to do..." At the sight of this, Beihuang Fan felt a little anxious and said this instinctively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her expression changed, not expecting for Qing Shui's reaction to be so intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Pa!"</span></p>
