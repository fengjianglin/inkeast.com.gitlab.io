 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 319 Qing Shui and The Deal with Elder Yun</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Through his Spiritual Sense, he saw a lady with an amazing figure. Her face turned towards him and Qing Shui knew that she had noticed him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Most importantly, Qing Shui could sense that her abilities were above the Martial King level. It was a lady whose level of cultivation was no lower than Martial King grade 3. However, she was weaker than Canghai.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As Qing Shui sensed the other her, a magnetic, mature female voice rang out, "Mister, why are you not entering? Could it be that you're afraid of a weak lady?" Her voice sounded experienced, yet extremely graceful.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"If you're a weak lady, then wouldn't I be just a harmless sheep?" Qing Shui mumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rubbing his nose, he pushed open the door and entered, seeing the lady standing in the living room. It was hard to tell her age, but she had a face of great beauty, a pair of attractive eyes which exuded gleams of knowledge. Her figure was slender and well-embodied, and her beautiful breasts pushed up her clothes, gently trembling as she spoke.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The line from her waist to her hip was extremely exquisite and brought out the fullness of her round hips. Her legs were slender and long, giving an air of gracefulness.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"A mature lady with great disposition!" Qing Shui thought. Qing Shui tended to be more passionate towards mature ladies. It was strange, since he never did lack motherly love, and had received more than anyone else ever did in his span of two lives. However, he had taken a liking to mature ladies ever since his previous life, and still did after coming to the world of the nine continents. Moreover...</span></p>
  <p><span style>While Qing Shui liked mature ladies, he knew that this one before him was no ordinary lady.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Who are you?” Qing Shui asked. </span></p>
  <p><span style>After seeing Qing Shui, the lady revealed a gaze of interest as she looked at him, unblinking. Never would she have thought that this young man was able to exude such an attractive aura. Compared to him, all the other young men seemed superficial and shallow. It was a strange feeling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I'm from Feng Clan. I'd like to strike a deal with you. Is that alright? You'll definitely be satisfied with the conditions," She said with a graceful smile.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled back. Recalling what he heard from Cang Wuya, he would always get a satisfactory deal from people who came to him for favors. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"Deal? What deal is there to talk about?" Qing Shui smiled, passing by the lady and heading into the bedroom.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Don't worry, you'll definitely not lose out. And it's something which you can easily accomplish." Having seen Qing Shui's attitude, the lady felt that it was going to be a bit difficult to get him to agree. After all, to have achieved so much at his young age, he would not be that easy to convince to agree to her condition. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Saying that, the lady looked at Qing Shui with her brows slightly knitted. She had once promised the clan's head that she would definitely get it done. As long as she could complete this, she would no longer be indebted to Feng Clan, she would no longer need to put up with his pestering, and she would be able to reject him. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady followed Qing Shui to the bedroom as she continued to looked at him silently, giving off the feeling that she would not leave until he agreed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The bedroom was not very big to begin with. Qing Shui looked at this lady who had a fatal attractiveness to him, a mature and graceful disposition. Especially that pair of eyes which Qing Shui could not describe. They were as if they’ve seen a lot in life, yet seemed knowledgeable, graceful, and lonely...</span></p>
  <p><span style>"What can you offer me?" Qing Shui took the chance to look all over her beautiful figure as he spoke, his outrageous gaze causing the lady to furrow her brows.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Money, martial arts, medicinal herbs, rare and precious treasures... I can satisfy all your desires," she replied, lifting her head to look at Qing Shui. She had never spoken to a man like this before, and had not been treated like this before either.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"While I'm interested in those as well, there's one thing which is even more attractive." Qing Shui grinned, his eyes looking at the lady's intoxicating beautiful eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady was very bright. Despite it being very obvious, she still acted oblivious, and carried on a glimpse of hope.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"What do you want? Go ahead and say it. If it's within my abilities, I'll do my best to satisfy you," she said casually.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I want you!" Qing Shui said firmly with a smile.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was very calm when he said this. When he first saw this lady, he already felt very strange. She was everything that he liked in a woman, regardless if it was her appearance, the feeling, her disposition, and the expression she showed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>All these were enough. A lady who was at least a grade 4 Martial King, on top of the above points, she was considered a top notch beauty.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While the lady had already guessed the answer, she still stood there in a daze, looking at Qing Shui silently, the expression in her gaze turned to that of disgust.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"As long as there are people from the Starday Hall who challenge you, you must defeat them. With the exception of Feng Clan's Feng Wuji. When he challenges you, you are not to defeat him. I'll promise you as long as you promise me this condition."</span></p>
  <p><span style>When she first saw Qing Shui, she thought that he was dazzling, like the starlight. But now, she discovered that he was also a crude man; an animal who thinks with the bottom half of his body, and the good impression she had of him dropped down to the lowest, despite already preparing for the worst possible scenario.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She had thought of some precious medicine and other things to offer, but when she saw Qing Shui's determined gaze, and especially after he had said that he "wants her", she knew the outcome.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She did not wish to be married to Feng Wuji. If she did not repay her debt to Feng Clan, she would definitely not be able to reject Feng Wuji's request. If it would turn out like that, she would rather let this guy whom she had initially thought well of to have the advantage, despite the disgusted feeling she had just by looking at him. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had initially only wanted to make things slightly difficult for her at the start. He did not know why he felt angered upon seeing her disgusted gaze. Such situations rarely come by.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was his inferior mindset from his previous life. Just like in his previous life when he saw ladies who were a bit well-to-do, ladies whom were out of his reach, especially those b*tches who led the life of a whore but yet expected a monument to their chastity.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady's expression caused Qing Shui's inferior mindset to rebel. In his previous life, there would be nothing he could do. But now, this lady was begging him, and while she might have some hidden troubles to promise him, these were no longer important.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Someone with her beauty should already have been played by others in Feng Clan, and it might not even be by just one person. He would just take it as venting out. Qing Shui lifted his gaze to look at her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"I promise you! Now help me take off my clothes!" Qing Shui stood by the bed, reaching out his hands to the side. He did not know that there was a tinge of revenge in his tone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady's dull gaze turned more into that of indifference, and after a long look at Qing Shui, she slowly walked over.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A light fragrance spread into his nose. The lady's tall figure was only half a head shorter than him, but with her hair put up, their height just about matched. Her slender neck and her hair pin which seemed to be for dignified ladies further increased her level of sexiness and gracefulness! </span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady did not see Qing Shui's gaze, but reached out her slender white hands, removing Qing Shui's clothes while trembling. Her clumsy and trembling appearance gave Qing Shui a different feeling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was the first time Qing Shui had enjoyed such a treatment, and by a great beauty, a mature lady with great poise and dignity. The lady's mountain peaks trembled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just as the lady removed two layers of his clothes, he reached out to grab one of her breast which did not fit into his hands, his five fingers digging into the wonderful feeling that was hard to describe.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady's body suddenly trembled, and her hands which were removing Qing Shui's clothes came to a stop. She even took a small step back, but managed to stop herself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Lowering her head, a flush of red had already dyed her tender ears, and she let out a faint sound of surprise from her nose!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Earlier, Qing Shui was aroused by Huoyun Liu-Li, and now he was even more agitated, kneading without a care, pinching the two peaks with his two hands.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady's body once again trembled. Qing Shui's outer clothes were already removed, and an outrageous tent rose up on his bottom half, touching the lady's soft stomach!</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Sizzz~!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui tore up the lady's top into pieces!</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Ahhh!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lady eventually did not manage to suppress her surprise cry, and took a step back anxiously. She lifted her head to look at Qing Shui, at a loss, her snow white tender skin emitting a beautiful glow like that of a jade's.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Her pair of perky snowballs at her chest trembled, and the lady covered them up anxiously, but failed to do so!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The two indistinct pink dots were extremely charming.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was already overcome by lust, reaching out his hands to slowly move away the lady's hands which she was using to block, staring at the well-rounded and beautiful breasts.</span></p>

 <p><span style>She did not wish to be married to Feng Wuji. If she did not repay her debt to Feng Clan, she would definitely not be able to reject Feng Wuji's request. If it would turn out like that, she would rather let this guy whom she had initially thought well of to have the advantage, despite the disgusted feeling she had just by looking at him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had initially only wanted to make things slightly difficult for her at the start. He did not know why he felt angered upon seeing her disgusted gaze. Such situations rarely come by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was his inferior mindset from his previous life. Just like in his previous life when he saw ladies who were a bit well-to-do, ladies whom were out of his reach, especially those b*tches who led the life of a whore but yet expected a monument to their chastity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady's expression caused Qing Shui's inferior mindset to rebel. In his previous life, there would be nothing he could do. But now, this lady was begging him, and while she might have some hidden troubles to promise him, these were no longer important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone with her beauty should already have been played by others in Feng Clan, and it might not even be by just one person. He would just take it as venting out. Qing Shui lifted his gaze to look at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I promise you! Now help me take off my clothes!" Qing Shui stood by the bed, reaching out his hands to the side. He did not know that there was a tinge of revenge in his tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady's dull gaze turned more into that of indifference, and after a long look at Qing Shui, she slowly walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light fragrance spread into his nose. The lady's tall figure was only half a head shorter than him, but with her hair put up, their height just about matched. Her slender neck and her hair pin which seemed to be for dignified ladies further increased her level of sexiness and gracefulness! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady did not see Qing Shui's gaze, but reached out her slender white hands, removing Qing Shui's clothes while trembling. Her clumsy and trembling appearance gave Qing Shui a different feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time Qing Shui had enjoyed such a treatment, and by a great beauty, a mature lady with great poise and dignity. The lady's mountain peaks trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the lady removed two layers of his clothes, he reached out to grab one of her breast which did not fit into his hands, his five fingers digging into the wonderful feeling that was hard to describe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady's body suddenly trembled, and her hands which were removing Qing Shui's clothes came to a stop. She even took a small step back, but managed to stop herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lowering her head, a flush of red had already dyed her tender ears, and she let out a faint sound of surprise from her nose!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier, Qing Shui was aroused by Huoyun Liu-Li, and now he was even more agitated, kneading without a care, pinching the two peaks with his two hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady's body once again trembled. Qing Shui's outer clothes were already removed, and an outrageous tent rose up on his bottom half, touching the lady's soft stomach!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sizzz~!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui tore up the lady's top into pieces!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady eventually did not manage to suppress her surprise cry, and took a step back anxiously. She lifted her head to look at Qing Shui, at a loss, her snow white tender skin emitting a beautiful glow like that of a jade's.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her pair of perky snowballs at her chest trembled, and the lady covered them up anxiously, but failed to do so!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two indistinct pink dots were extremely charming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was already overcome by lust, reaching out his hands to slowly move away the lady's hands which she was using to block, staring at the well-rounded and beautiful breasts.</span></p>
