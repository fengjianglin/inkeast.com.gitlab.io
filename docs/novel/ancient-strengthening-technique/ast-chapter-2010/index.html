 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t feel uncomfortable with the suspicions the opponent had on him. In fact, there was a saying which was emphasized across the continent: ‘you shouldn’t bite off more than you can chew’. Usually, there were very few people who would be the best in two things at once. For example, a powerful alchemist like him, for someone at his level, if he was very proficient in refining medicines, his strength would be the opposite. Naturally, when compared to ordinary people, his strength would be superior, but when compared to the people also in the alchemy field, his strength would be unbearable to look at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same went for physicians. If a physician dedicated all of his hard work on his medical skills, his medical skills would naturally be good. However, without a doubt, he wouldn’t have as much time for his cultivation. Thus, if a physician ever wanted to kill a person, it would have to depend on who he was killing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though there were many people who could excel in two fields, very few would have the energy to do that. If that was the case, wouldn’t it be better if they focused just on one thing? Maybe that way, they would turn out to be more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Mo Yulong. How can I address you, sir?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Qing Shui,” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please make your move. I don't wish to bully you.” Mo Yulong smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Mo Yulong and smiled, “Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui suddenly appeared in front of Mo Yulong with his Nine Palace Steps. It gave Mo Yulong quite a surprise. He immediately turned around with an unusual move to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his arm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon-capturing Hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment Qing Shui unleashed the Dragon-capturing Hands, Mo Yulong moved once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yulong’s body was bound for a short while. When the time passed, and he was getting ready to dodge once again, he felt a numb sensation across his body and didn’t get to muster up enough strength in time. He immediately got hit in the chest by Qing Shui with a straight punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t hit him too hard, but still, it was enough to make Mo Yulong have difficulty to breathe. It was so bad to the point that everything went blank in front of him. Following on, Qing Shui unleashed his Continuous Combo like a violent storm. If Qing Shui had wanted to kill him a hundred times, he would have died a hundred times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Mo Yulong was like Qing Shui’s punching bag. Until he got hit out of the platform by Qing Shui, he still felt a bit dizzy. He only came back to his senses after a while and looked at Qing Shui as if he were looking at a monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I told you before that a physician doesn’t kill with a sword. I have no intention to kill you. So, how are you feeling? Does it feel great?” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it is my first time seeing this kind of fighting style. Thank you for holding back.” Mo Yulong said with a serious voice. From the beginning until the end, he didn’t get to make any of his moves. He knew better than anyone else about his strength. Though he might not be at the top, he had yet to see anyone that was capable of this across the Northern Ice Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was just too scary and at the same time very hurtful to him. Not only did he have no chance of fighting back, but his opponent was even a young man. At the very least, the opponent looked younger than himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The previous battle ended too quickly. Despite that, a lot of people still saw it clearly. However, they didn’t manage to see through that many things. It was more like two people that were acting. Qing Shui didn’t hit hard, but he managed to defeat Mo Yulong with ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, you possess a very mysterious battle technique. Please allow me to test it for myself,” At this moment, a woman said as she came up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui glanced towards his opponent and automatically knew that she was a member of the Immortal Fox Palace. She was emitting the same aura as the woman who previously crossed fists with Beiming Xue. However, this woman looked a bit older. Or rather, the word ‘mature’ should be more appropriate to describe her. There was not even a single wrinkle on her face; it looked smooth like jade. She looked just the same as a teenage girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Feel free to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman let out a seducing aura from all her body. Faint Yin Qi could be felt emitting from her body, in between her movements. This kind of Yin Qi was the Origin Yin Qi which belonged to a woman. Men would find it very attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moon Fox Hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fox Charming Movement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s hand movements looked very complex. Indeed, there was a kind of beauty to them; it was stunning. Combining with her unique movements, she was unusually pleasing to look at. She could very easily make one forget that they were in the middle of a fight. Instead of battling, she looked more like she was dancing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the woman poked Qing Shui with her finger. This finger strike was very pure and contained an intense Yin Origin Qi. She had a faint smile on her face; both of her bright eyes looked so charming that they could pull out one’s very soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head. If Qing Hanye had been the one to use it, she might still stand a chance in seducing him, but this woman was just too inferior in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s martial techniques were mainly built on her charms. If a person didn’t have a strong willpower, it would be futile even if he was aware that he should block his opponent. So to say, It was impossible to defend effectively. This was precisely what was formidable about women. It was just as the saying went: ‘if I die under a skirt, I can still flirt as a ghost’. There were some things which could never be controlled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s eyes looked very clear. As soon as the woman’s eyes and Qing Shui’s eyes met, she automatically knew that she must escape. She swiftly stepped back. However, Qing Shui wouldn’t let her do as she pleased; he unleashed his Dragon-capturing Hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he stomped on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment the effect of Dragon-capturing Hands was lost, the shockwave created from the Mighty Elephant Stomp immediately blew her away. She completely lost control over her body. Even if she knew how to fly, it would still take time for her to balance herself. At this moment, Qing Shui hopped up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cloudhand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Taichi Realm was something which shouldn’t be underestimated. It immediately blew the woman out of the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle ended. Just like before, Qing Shui finished the battle very easily. By now, the people were all unable to understand what was happening. What kind of a battle was this? During the fight, the fluctuations in auras were very vivid. No one had managed to sense the motions of Qing Shui’s aura. It seemed as if he weren’t using his Origin Qi and only used his physical power to defeat his opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, yet another two challengers went up the stage. Just like before, Qing Shui defeated them with ease. Furthermore, his opponents were all uninjured. Just as Qing Shui said before, he was a physician. Since he had no grudges against them, he wouldn’t try to hurt them. Unless the opponents had the intention to hurt him, he wouldn’t try to hurt them first.</span></p>

At this moment, many people had also begun to measure this physician. “He is very young, but how are his medical skills?” However, now it didn’t seem to be the time to think about this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, you seem to enjoy acting alone. Here, fight me.” A young man appeared on the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xicheng Yeyang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am just challenging him to expose his tricks. Xicheng Clan has already taken over a platform. I will go down immediately after I beat him,” Xicheng Yeyang said to the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xicheng Clan had previously taken over a place. It could be seen that the Xicheng Clan possessed decent strength because of this, but now that Qing Shui on the platform, Xicheng Yeyang couldn’t endure it. He wasn’t convinced of Qing Shui’s strength. To him, this was all an act. Actually, a lot of people also felt that way, but only a few expert warriors would know that this young man was extraordinary, so much so that he could be described with the word ‘formidable’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Care to join me in the acting? How about this, you can pretend like you just spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood and got thrown off the stage,” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the upright young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Xicheng Yeyang was almost twice Qing Shui’s age. However, he still looked very young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you are strong enough, I won’t mind getting involved in the performance,” Xicheng Yeyang said in a firm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head when he saw the over-confident look on his face. It was yet another show-off. However, this wasn’t surprising; everyone was showy. Some revealed it all the time, some did it occasionally, some would do it openly and without fear, whereas the rest would do it secretly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, you will definitely put on a good show.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately walked towards him. As for Xicheng Yeyang, once he got into a battle, he wouldn’t let down his guard. The moment his figure moved, three hollow images appeared. He swung the long sword in his arm in a horizontal motion right away. A sword light divided into three slashes and advanced towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xicheng Clan’s Moon-pursuing Sword Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the Moon-pursuing Sword Technique was unleashed, it would be like the moonlight showering down from the sky. It was sharp and bright, like drizzles and winds in the spring and yet its wounding prowess was enough to penetrate through one's skin. This sword qi was the most formidable killing qi. Little by little, it pierced through the target’s body. While being under the control of the caster, once it burst, it would immediately cause the enemy to disappear into dust. It would destroy the enemy’s organs almost instantly.</span></p>
