 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop hesitating. It would be a piece of cake for me to harm you. Not only you, but Heishui City is also nothing to me. I have nothing against you.” Qing Shui knew he had to say something heavier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui’s words were quite effective. Bai Sheng knew he indeed had this power. Hence, he nodded and left quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, Qing Shui walked to the Duke’s mansion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, who are you? How dare you break into the Duke’s mansion?” The guard at the gate blocked Qing Shui and yelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have something to discuss with the Duke.” Qing Shui stopped and replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you, do you think you can meet the Duke so nonchalantly? Go away. The Duke said he is not seeing anyone!” The guard sounded impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was surprised to see a servant acting so arrogantly. Was it the servant or the Duke that was arrogant?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like the Duke really looked down at the people of Heishui City. Qing Shui was here for trouble anyway so he would not leave. He pushed the guard away, “Since you won’t bring him to me, I’ll find him myself then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How dare you be so presumptuous! Stop him! Aim to kill with no mercy!” The one who was pushed away screamed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui stopped and watched the man screaming on the floor. That arrogant and pompous look. That attitude which took others’ lives so casually. Qing Shui gave a slap straightaway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was better for someone like this to die. Qing Shui had zero considerations for the Hei Clan now. It was obvious that the Hei Clan was arrogant and reckless, judging by these people. Hence, it was better to wipe out this Hei Clan. After all, their sins were great. It was not a bad thing but rather, a good deed to kill bad people and wipe out the evils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recalled a similar situation in the story of Buddhism. Sometimes, you would attain merits by saving only one person, the reason was that the saved person was of great virtue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Likewise, your merit would drop substantially by killing one person because this man had great virtue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another case was a large increment of merit by killing someone. The killed person was an absolute devil with enormous sins. It was a great merit to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, sometimes, he would kill people mercilessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui killed a man and the rest were terrified. Then, they dispersed and shouted while running, “Somebody is killing people in the Duke’s mansion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At once, the Duke’s mansion was lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is that? How dare he be impudent in the Duke’s mansion? He is asking for death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, many people emerged and slashed toward Qing Shui. Qing Shui was not in a hurry, neither anxious. He instantly settled all who aimed their weapons at him. Arrogance made the Hei Clan’s people lose their minds and underestimate the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge commotion in the Duke’s mansion made many people think that Heishui City was about to undergo a world-shaking change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, at this moment, no one would take action. The leading bird got shot first. It was the wisest to observe the situation calmly under unknown conditions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a force began its move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bai Clan and the Hei Clan were nemeses. Though the Hei Clan was strong, they had to pay a painful price to break the Bai Clan completely. They might not even be able to sustain such a great loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bai Clan was straightforward. They dashed into the Hei Clan and the Duke's mansion. Then, they continued the massacre. However, peace returned very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle was short, but the Bai Clan saw Qing Shui’s the frightening strength. He killed the strongest man in the Hei Clan with one move. That made many men of the Bai Clan to draw cold breaths. What kind of scary creature was this? Could it be a demon in human form?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition to the previous encounter, Bai Sheng’s status in the Bai Clan was extremely high. Bai Sheng was currently the strongest in his clan so Qing Shui asked Bai Sheng to take over the Duke’s mansion. Nobody from the Bai Clan had a second opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at Bai Sheng and said, “I wish that you manage this place well. I met the Black Armoured Army in the remoted Yang Village and stayed there for a few days. The people are humble and honest. It was great.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mr. Qing, no worries. I know what to do. I will stop this Heishui City from doing those things under broad daylight. Whoever dares to do that, I will make them regret.” Bai Sheng said earnestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe in you. Do it well and perhaps we can meet again next time. By then, you'll probably be some duke or even higher.” Qing Shui tapped on his shoulder and then vanished in front of Bai Sheng and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui knew some of the Water Nation’s situations after these troubles. It took a short time when he was around Heishui City. Qing Shui wanted to head to the Emperor City of the Water Nation directly and check out the most flourishing and strongest place of the Water Nation. With that, he could roughly know about the Demon King Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, he wanted to see if there was a Divine Palace and a Demon Gate present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Middle Three Regions. Qing Shui was not sure if Tantai Lingyan was in the Middle Three Regions. Also, he wondered what was her strength now. It was a headache to think about her. The Demon Saint Blood was too brutal. Initially, it was fine. They probably would have celebrated their wedding by now if they were together all this while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was upset to think of that. This woman had enough pain. He did not want her to continue her sufferings. Yet, why did she forget about him? She seemed to have forgotten everything related to him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Step. The Water Nation’s land was too wide so the Emperor City would take more than just one or two days to reach. On the first day, he arrived at a summit. This was a huge mountain range. As soon as he arrived, Qing Shui watched the distant place out of alertness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge bird was flying towards him. This was a purebreed Thunderbird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the legends, the Thunderbird had the Phoenix's and the Golden-Winged Roc’s bloodline. Yet, Qing Shui felt that it was meaningless. He only knew that a Thunderbird was powerful. Moreover, it was an ancient heritage purebreed Thunderbird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Thunderbird was purple in color, about a hundred meters big. It was full of purple lightning, giving out scary beams of thunder. Then, it flapped its wings toward Qing Shui at once. Thunder with the size of a water pail flashed at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui cursed. “What is this dumb bird attacking me for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, Qing Shui still evaded elegantly. He took out the Golden Battle Halberd and dashed against the Thunderbird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The distance was too far for him to use the Stellar Transposition. He wondered if he had to kill it now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gigantic winds waved and the thunder became more rapid and powerful. A scary typhoon appeared in the air. The wind could absolutely tear down any weapons. It was incomparable by the wind in the past life.</span></p>

Seeing that this dumb bird was so unaware of the situation, he slammed his Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>

It did not hurt the Thunderbird. Contrarily, an intense electric flow conducted to Qing Shui's body.</span></p>
