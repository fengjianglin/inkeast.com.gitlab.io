 <p><strong>AST 834 - Yun Duan’s Heart，Hu Wei Adventurer Guild</strong></p>
 <p>Yun Duan was stunned for a moment, “I will go check.”</p>
 <p>She spoke in a mild manner. She knew how powerful Hu Wenlong was since he was one of the top-rankers in Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. Even the head, Hu Yunlong could not defeat him. He could have easily gotten the position as the head but he was too obsessed about martial arts. He loved cultivating and was engrossed in it, so the position fell to Hu Yunlong.</p>
 <p>Even though he disliked troublesome matters, he enjoyed fighting and was very protective of his own people. Everyone in Heavenly Beast City knew about Hu Wenlong’s character and how he dealt with his affairs. There was an occasion when a talented member from the Zhou Clan in Heavenly Beast City maimed the son of the fifth brother, Hu Yanglong, of the Hu Clan. After that, Hu Wenlong directly eliminated the entire Zhou Clan.</p>
 <p>The incident caused a ruckus in Heavenly Beast City but Hu Wei Adventurer Guild was extremely powerful so nobody dared to criticize them. Besides, the entire Zhou Clan had disappeared so no one wanted to stir up trouble for themselves.</p>
 <p>After this incident, no one dared to offend the people from Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. The disciples of the core members became more and more arrogant and unreasonable because most people could only hold their grudges silently and not retaliate. As a result, the members from Hu Wei Adventurer Guild habitually oppressed others.</p>
 <p>Many people wished to join Hu Wei Adventurer Guild as it was the ticket to staying alive since the Guild had great influence in Heavenly Beast City and even the nearby surrounding cities.</p>
 <p>“Father will go with you, even though I do not have the ability to protect you,” a handsome scholarly man sighed helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Father, don’t say that about yourself. I am happy that I have a father like you. I feel blessed,” Yun Duan said happily.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan knew that her father would definitely follow her so she did not attempt to dissuade him. She looked at Qing Shui, “Don’t involve yourself in this mess. Tong’er, please show Qing Shui the way out.”</p>
 <p>“Elder sis, I want to accompany you.” Yun Tong held out his fists as he knew that this matter was not as simple as it seemed.</p>
 <p>“Let me bring her away with me.” Yun Yao stood up and said. He knew that the situation facing them was tricky. His plan was to escape with her and either return after things died down or never return if something went wrong.</p>
 <p>The scholarly man sighed and so did the others. Even his beautiful wife’s eyes glistened with grief. Yun Duan hesitated for a moment and said, “Qing Shui, I kept thinking of you since the last time we parted. Even though I stabbed you, my heart hurt. Over these few years, I will think about you every now and then. I don’t really understand what we have between us but I just want you to be well. We will always be friends.”</p>
 <p>Perhaps, only during the most fragile period of her life did she realized that she had so many regrets. Luckily for her, she could see Qing Shui during the final juncture of her life.</p>
 <p>She knew that she would definitely die this time so she discard her reservations and told him her honest feelings.</p>
 <p>She had kept her virginity until her encounter with Qing Shui and had never had any intimate contact with other men after that. Such a woman would not forget the man she had her first sexual experience with but she never said that aloud.</p>
 <p>She knew that if she didn’t confess today, she might never have the chance to do so. At least he would know her feelings and see that she was not a wanton woman.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned when he heard what she said. He could never have imagined that such an obstinate woman would actually show her vulnerability now.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you should leave with my brother. Don’t even come back to Heavenly Beast City,” Yun Duan said gently as she faced Qing Shui. She looked as if she was about to reach out to him but did not do so in the end.</p>
 <p>“I already told you that I will settle matters with Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. Don’t you remember that your grandfather said that you will have a fortunate life? Don’t you know that Hu Wei Adventurer Guild will become stronger because of you? I am the man of your destiny so let me step in.” Qing Shui smiled slightly.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I know that you want to help. Even though you are very powerful now, you can’t defeat Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. So please listen to me and leave with my brother. Before it is too late.” Yun Duan was a little emotional and spoke very quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a warmth in his heart hearing her words. So, she was actually so gentle. Qing Shui liked her tender voice and it was even more heartfelt since it came from such a prideful woman. He was very happy and wanted to give her a stable life despite not being able to give her much affection.</p>
 <p>Perhaps because she was too involved in the issue, Yun Duan did not believe for a moment that Qing Shui had the ability to go against Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. On the other hand, even though it was unbelievable to the others, they still saw it as a hope.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, quick! Let me send you out. If we delay, it may be too late. Don’t upset my younger sister.” Yun Yao urged anxiously.</p>
 <p>“You are unworthy of being her elder brother. I can make my own decision and you can leave. If you want to run away, you can go ahead, no one will stop you,” Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>“Who do you think you are? How dare you criticize me? “ Yun Yao yelled at Qing Shui, angered by embarrassment after Qing Shui exposed him.</p>
 <p>“If you weren’t Yun Duan’s elder brother, I wouldn’t even waste my saliva on you. How can a man use his own sister as a bargaining chip. You are just a spineless coward so don’t get angry. You don’t deserve to be angry because you are not even an ant in my eyes.” Qing Shui suddenly released his spiritual energy creating an oppressive aura.</p>
 <p>Yun Yao fell to the ground due to the oppressive aura and his sweat poured from his entire body, he was rendered speechless.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, sounds of explosion came from outside. They also heard screams and cries. Yun Duan ran outside, not knowing what had happened. Qing Shui looked at the members of the Yun Clan before running out after her.</p>
 <p>The commotion came from the main hall of the Cloud Adventurer Guild. Apparently, the main hall had been destroyed. Hu Wei Adventurer Guild had really been offended. Qing Shui smiled at Yun Duan and the other members of the Yun family also followed them outside.</p>
 <p>“Hu Wenlong, you are really too much,” Before they reached the main hall, a loud old-sounding voice rang out.</p>
 <p>“You old men, how foolish! Cloud Adventurer Guild will be destroyed because of this silly little girl. I’m giving you the easy way out. Get out of my way. If you stop me, I will annihilate your entire clan.” a similarly old but much more overbearing voice replied.</p>
 <p>“We are grateful to the old sir of this place. Even if I die here, I will not let you bring away our young mistress,” Some old voices rang out.</p>
 <p>“Stupid fools! If you join our Hu Wei Adventurer Guild, you will enjoy a life of riches and your future generations will have easier lives. Look there are intelligent people from the Yun Clan too. Why don’t you ask them if they suffered after they joined my Hu Wei Adventurer Guild?” The oppressive old voice retorted.</p>
 <p>“Third Brother, there are many opportunities in Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. Come on, we should…”</p>
 <p>“Shut up! When you left Cloud Adventurer Guild, we disowned you. A person without any moral boundaries does not deserve to be called a human.”</p>
 <p>“People always seek to climb up higher and water will always flow downwards. I don’t think I made the wrong decision. We all have our own pursuits. Why do you have to be so stubborn?”</p>
 <p>“ Sixth, if you left us in the past, I would not criticize you. But the Grand Ancestor is not around and Hu Wei Adventurer Guild is breathing down our backs, yet you choose to leave us without a hint of guilt at this critical point and even join our rivals, Hu Wei Adventurer Guild! Is this what a decent person does? If Hu Wei Adventurer Guild ends up like our Cloud Adventurer Guild, will you also switch sides and go against Hu Wei Adventurer Guild?” The man who spoke previously replied. A soft approach was always more effective than a aggressive reply.</p>
 <p>Hu Wenlong frowned, “San Cai, you can stop creating disaccord. Since you don’t accept our offer, don’t blame us for being unpleasant. It’s your own choice to seek death!“</p>
 <p>“Bring it on. Even if we die, we won’t make this easy for you!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui was already nearby. He could see that the main hall was destroyed and there was rubble everywhere. At the same time, there were people lying on the ground; some of them were already dead. There were many people surrounding the site, other than the adventurers there were also people who just wanted to watch the commotion.</p>
 <p>The most eye-catching person among them was an exceptionally tall and muscular elderly man. He was at least 8 chi and was distinctly taller than the rest of the people. He wore a purple battle armor and had a headful of white hair and chiselled features. Even though he was old, he looked more energetic and powerful than any other younger man.</p>
 <p>There were about 20 people behind that old man, they were either middle-aged or as old as him. The aura of the man standing at the forefront made Qing Shui conclude that he was Hu Wenlong.</p>
 <p>Their opponents were also a bunch of middle-aged and elderly men. There were more than 20 of them but none of them could match Hu Wenlong, so they were still at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” Yun Duan shouted to stop the old men from attacking.</p>
 <p>“Third Grandfather, Fifth Grandfather…” Yun Duan shouted out. Her heart ached knowing the perseverance of these men, she was touched.</p>
 <p>“Hai, what a pitiful child,” the old men sighed.</p>
 <p>“I am here. Why do you want to kill them?” Yun Duan yelled at Hu Wenlong, she was extremely furious.</p>
 <p>“Why do I want to kill? Don’t you know? I want to kill them and show them how they die!” the sturdy old man glared at Yun Duan and sent a powerful aura towards her.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan was only a low grade Martial Saint so there was no way she could withstand it. Her body felt weak and her face turned pale but she forced herself to stand. But the aura that weighed like a mountain was like an ocean that could swallow up her tiny boat anytime.</p>
 <p>Just then, Qing Shui stood in front of Yun Duan. It was as if her tiny boat had found a refuge and the waves around her became calm again. The figure in front of her wasn’t huge but it was so sturdy that her heart calmed down.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood smiling at Hu Wenlong, “Hu Wei Adventurer Guild is so arrogant! Aren’t you afraid that someone will pull over your tiger tooth?”</p>
 <p>“Who are you? How dare you speak to me in this manner? You’ve got some nerve!” the old man boomed loudly. His voice continued ringing in the ears of the surrounding people as the man increased the pressure on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He wanted to embarrass Qing Shui. How dare that young chap challenge him?</p>
 <p>However, he realized that his pressure was like a sinking rock in an ocean. The young man did not show any reaction. It was as if the young man felt nothing. Just when the old man was bewildered, Qing Shui’s aura rushed towards him like a thunderstorm.</p>
 <p>Like a ferocious tiger out of the mountains, the force was overwhelming!</p>
