 <p><strong>AST 868 - Violent Blood Bear, Finding another Deity Statue again</strong></p>
 <p>Actually, when had he not been blessed by the heavens? Merely, Qing Shui was feeling slightly envious at the moment. He was truly only a little envious, but that was it.</p>
 <p>However, the others did not have such a feeling. Currently, he was already aware of the reason as to why this lady would lead members of Mu Family to the Sky Penetrating Mountains. It was not only due to her being strong and having exceptional talent, it was also because she had more than ten Treasure Hunting Pigs.</p>
 <p>Owing to the Treasure Hunting Pigs, their harvest was many times greater than if they didn’t have them. The reason she had not let them out earlier was perhaps because there were still other people in the vicinity.</p>
 <p>Now that they had travelled over 2000 li into the mountain range, basically no one else could be seen. It would be hard to locate them even if there were others around. The Sky Penetrating Mountains was very large and akin to a maze.</p>
 <p>Just like that, everyone split up. Each pair followed a Treasure Hunting Pig. It was agreed that whistles would be used for communication. In addition, the Treasure Hunting Pigs could communicate with one another. Therefore, they weren’t afraid of getting lost, only worried that they would be too far away and unable to assist one another in times of danger.</p>
 <p>Over twenty people and more than ten Treasure Hunting Pigs. It was almost exactly two people per pig. Due to some carelessness, only Qing Shui and the Mu Family girl remained, as well as a Treasure Hunting Pig.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, we’ll follow it!” said the girl with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“Okay!” replied Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Squeak Squeak!</p>
 <p>The cry of the Treasure Hunting Pig was shrill and resounding. It appeared to be sending a message to its comrades, telling them that this particular route was already occupied and for them to head towards other places to hunt.</p>
 <p>Originally, it still felt quite lively with over twenty people being together. All of a sudden, only the two of them were left. This made the atmosphere feel a little cold and lonely. It was quiet all around, with only the sound of wind blowing and the occasional roars from beasts. If a person without cultivation was to be here, they would be frightened till their knees went soft.</p>
 <p>As time passed by, Qing Shui and the woman followed after the Treasure Hunting Pig as it unceasingly travelled back and forth. All of a sudden, a three metre long demonic beast lunged towards the Treasure Hunting Pig. The Treasure Hunting Pig did not have the slightest reaction however.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>The stone that Qing Shui had prepared in his hand shot out, directly piercing the demonic beast’s skull. The stone had drawn a bright line of light in the air. This was the result of its speed reaching the limits.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>The demonic beast had met with a violent death without making a single cry.</p>
 <p>The woman looked at Qing Shui as her eyes twitched. With her formidable strength, she was naturally able to see the might of that strike. This long-ranged shooting was an ability that every cultivator knew. However, it was like the disparity between a child and a giant when compared with him.</p>
 <p>Exactly how much did he know? If he were to specialize, would he have already achieved the peak now?</p>
 <p>“Thank you. Actually, the vitality of the Treasure Hunting Pig is very strong. Biting the Treasure Hunting Pig would only result in the destruction of the demonic beast’s teeth.” the girl smiled as she spoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He was also aware of it. However, after seeing the little foot-long pig and a demonic beast being a giant wolf that could almost eat it with a single bite, he had unknowingly used a hidden weapon to kill the giant wolf.</p>
 <p>The giant wolf was only an Early Martial Saint demonic beast. However, Qing Shui had displayed his hidden weapon techniques. There was nothing wrong with that though, since there was no need to hide it from people.</p>
 <p>Although the Treasure Hunting Pig did not have any strength of its own, even Early Martial Saint demonic beasts were unable to harm it. This was the reason why they continued to exist till this day.</p>
 <p>Squeak Squeak!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the dense forest halfway up the mountain, from where the cries of a Treasure Hunting Pig were ringing. Qing Shui and the woman rushed over to the location of the sounds, since these sounds generally indicated that it had discovered items of a spiritual nature.</p>
 <p>Upon reaching their destination, the two of them were astonished for a while. It was a hidden mountain cave. An excitement that was hard to suppress flashed across his face as they arrived at it’s entrance.</p>
 <p>This was because the aura within was too familiar to him. The pressure was much stronger than the outside. Looking at each other, the woman took the lead and entered with Qing Shui following behind her.</p>
 <p>A large hall, this was a large hall that gave Qing Shui a familiar feeling. However, there was a lot of dust in here, with even more traces left behind by demonic beasts. With a single look, they found a few flying beasts and three giant bears currently snoring loudly in their sleep.</p>
 <p>Although there was a pressure here, it was only present within the great hall. Strong demonic beasts would still be able to live here as they like. These three giant bears were over ten meters long, their gigantic bodies resembled a small mountain.</p>
 <p>The body shapes of demonic beasts were unlike that of birds. The wings of birds spanned over half of their body, and they would look very big when they extended their wings. Demonic beasts did not have any wings, but their gigantic bodies shocked people. The terrifying power they had and their immense roars made people feel uneasy.</p>
 <p>Perhaps because they smelled the odor of humans, the three giant bears suddenly stood up. Their gigantic eyes flashed red as they looked towards Qing Shui and the woman. The Treasure Hunting Pig had already run off to some unknown place.</p>
 <p>Violent Blood Bear!</p>
 <p>Their entire body was brown and had blood red eyes. This kind of bear easily became berserk. Once they entered berserk mode, their entire body would turn blood red and their strength would become twofold. Upon being injured or seeing blood, their strength would increase even further.</p>
 <p>The Violent Blood Bear had a strength of one to three stars. Within the Sky Penetrating Mountains, everything was abnormal, yet it was also considered normal. Therefore, one should not be shocked to meet with any strong demonic beasts. Just like the Cheng Family, they could only blame themselves for being unlucky</p>
 <p>If the three Violent Blood Bears before them were to turn berserk, their strength would multiply, and they would be much more powerful. Although Qing Shui and the woman did not feel threatened, they didn’t dare to be careless. At this point, the three giant bears lunged towards them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held the Violet Gold Divine Shield in his left hand and the Thunder God in his right.</p>
 <p>Presently, Qing Shui’s base strength was one star, with his defense being slightly more than one and a half stars.</p>
 <p>Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection and Diamond Crossing Rivers allowed Qing Shui’s strength, defense and speed to double.</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy increased his base strength by 60%, Mental State Akin To That Of Immovable Mountains increased his base strength by 50%, Frenzied Bull's Strength increased his base strength by 30%, the Heavenly Thunder Slash increased his strength by 30%, the Shield Attack increased his strength by 20%, the Heavenly Talisman increased his strength and defense by 50%, the Combination Sword Technique increase his strength by 40%, and the Thunder God doubled his entire strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also holding the Violet Gold Divine Shield, which increased his base strength by an additional 100%. He jumped with a rush and the Violet Gold Divine Shield in his hand suddenly smashed down on the Violent Blood Bear.</p>
 <p>(Prady’s Note: (((((1.0+0.6+0.5+0.3)*(1.30))*(1.20))*(1.50))*(1.40))*(2.0)) = 14.41x base strength....)</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t sure why the mountain cave could endure such strong energy fluctuations. Was it due to the Deity Statue? Perhaps due to the mountain being very large while this cave being very small? It was just like using a needle to poke a small hole in a rock, very hard for this small hole to cave in.</p>
 <p>The gigantic Violent Blood Bear was smashed by such an overbearing attack. The Thunder God in his right hand immediately unleashed Heaven Falls and the Earth Rends, aiming towards the gigantic skull of the giant bear who was currently dizzy.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>As the hammer struck down, the gigantic bear was smashed. Blood directly spurted from its head, reaching tens of meters in height. The giant bear roared savagely, but that was merely a fierce final roar.</p>
 <p>Its entire brain was already jolted till it shattered, it would’ve been weird if it weren’t dead.</p>
 <p>Compared to Qing Shui, the lady wielded her Spiritual Link Divine Sword skillfully. Every stab would reach the bone. The bear had already entered berserk mode. It appeared even more fierce and savage with blood covering its entire body.</p>
 <p>Under the stimulation of blood, the other Violent Blood Bear had already started to berserk, lunging towards the woman. The Violent Blood Bear was a kind of demonic beast that never cowers regardless of the situation. Therefore, if one were to met a large pack of Violent Blood Bears, there were only two options, either to kill them all or flee.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had basically killed a Violent Blood Bear in a single move. She had previously sensed the huge energy fluctuations within Qin Shui’s body. This made her very shocked. She only had her current achievements due to obtaining a saint ranked item, could he possibly be the same?</p>
 <p>The woman discovered that ever since she had met this man, the frequency in which she felt shocked was much higher than before. So much so that she had the urge in wanting to understand him, wanting to know how he achieved it. However, she knew that she could not ask, as he definitely had his own treasures. Asking would only lead to suspicion. Furthermore, he definitely wouldn’t say it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had stopped one, while another was killed by the woman. The remaining bear was easily dispatched by the two of them.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, the lady took out a medicine bottle and skillfully picked apart the Violent Blood Bears. After retrieving their cores and gall bladders, she poured a bit of the powder on them. Very quickly, the three bears dissolved.</p>
 <p>Corpse Dissolving Powder!</p>
 <p>Corpse Dissolving Powder was an item that was only effective towards corpses of people and demonic beasts. As long as one still had any signs of life, it would be of no use. This medicinal powder was very strange, and it was refined from the bones and blood of a certain demonic beast. It was relatively valuable as it could not only dissolve corpses, but also able to purify the surroundings.</p>
 <p>The Corpse Dissolving Powder was especially important in such a place. Presently for example, they would have to remove the corpses and stench of blood if they wanted to stay in this place for a while. It would easily attract the attention of nearby demonic beasts otherwise. If they weren’t careful, that would be truly unfortunate.</p>
 <p>At first, Qing Shui was prepared to use his primordial flames to burn the corpses. However, he knew that the woman would definitely have her ways, since she had come here quite a few times.</p>
 <p>After cleaning up this place, they went out to take a look. After discovering that there were no problems, Qing Shui headed back. The woman was standing there, appearing to be waiting for him.</p>
 <p>“Qing ShuiDeity Statue, do you know about the Deity Statue?” the woman asked Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I’ve seen it before.” replied Qing Shui affirmatively. Qing Shui felt relieved for a moment. Looks like this wasn’t the first time the lady had seen the Deity Statue. She also had her own stroke of luck. Furthermore, it was most likely related to the Deity Statue.</p>
 <p>“These are yours” said the woman as she handed the Violent Blood Bear’s core and gall bladder to him.</p>
 <p>“We’ve already agreed that all the items are yours. I’m only here to search for the Sky Penetrating Grass.” Qing Shui shook his head as he refused.</p>
 <p>The lady paused for a moment, she then smiled and said, “What about this Deity Statue? Is it mine?”</p>
 <p>“Naturally!” replied Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>The lady gently sighed and said, “If there is the Sky Penetrating Grass that you need inside the cave and I also want it, would you take action against me?”</p>
 <p>He replied after hesitating, “No!”.</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“I won’t!” Qing Shui replied with more certainty this time.</p>
 <p>“We’ll split it evenly. If you don’t agree, we’ll leave right now.” The girl said as she smiled towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know what was on her mind at the moment. After hesitating for a while, he nodded his head and replied, “Let’s open it first and take a look. If you still insist at that time, I’ll split with you.”</p>
 <p>“You have that much distrust in me? Do I look like that sort of greedy woman?” the lady replied, appearing to be extremely angry.</p>
