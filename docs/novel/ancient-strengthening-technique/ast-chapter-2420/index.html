 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2420 - Heading to the Upper Three Regions, the Nine Stars Domain's Ice Star Nation</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui stowed his Divine Weapon Flying Sword, looked at Bai Tian, and said while smiling, "Do you have any plans to head to the Upper Three Regions?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Tian shook his head, looked at Qing Shui, and said, "Although I'll also be able to live a good life there, it wouldn't be as carefree as when I'm here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at Bai Tian and smiled. "That's true. You have a terrifying advantage here. If this legacy is sustained, it's not a bad thing either. I'm going to leave and head to the Upper Three Regions. If I'm free, I'll come back and have a drink with you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's words had two meanings to them. He was telling Bai Tian that although he was leaving, he would still be coming back occasionally. Therefore, the things here would still have to be settled properly, for example, the Divine Palace and the old woman and her grandson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of course you'll be welcome. I'll have good wine prepared to welcome Brother then." Bai Tian smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Tian was the only one who knew how bitter he was feeling inside from the terror and pressure Qing Shui brought him. Qing Shui's existence was like having a blade hanging over his head. As long as Qing Shui was willing to, he would be able to kill Bai Tian with great ease. This made Bai Tian—who had always been a top existence in the Middle Three Regions—feel extremely aggrieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, things turned out pretty well. Qing Shui didn't think of snatching his position nor would he stay here for long. This was good news. Moreover, they were considered friends of sorts. Bai Tian had good judgement with people. As long as he didn't offend Qing Shui and infuriate him, Qing Shui wouldn't do anything to him even if he were to remain here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a great fortune amidst all the misfortune. This time around, his complacent mindset was changed. There would always be people out there who were stronger than you. For him to be defeated even when he was in the Forsaken Heaven Region, he felt that he still needed to improve and gain further advancement from the breaking through of the Heavenly Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He revealed a confident smile, as if he had found a goal in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, that's a promise. We'll be heading off!" Qing Shui waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll send you off!" Bai Tian sent Qing Shui and the others all the way out of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people found out that this young man was able to move the dominator. Although a victor wasn't decided between them, everyone sort of understood the situation. At the very least, Bai Tian wasn't confident that he'd be able to take down Qing Shui. Otherwise, they wouldn't have entered such a relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the feud between them was that of having his son killed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt very agitated to know that they were heading for the Upper Three Regions. It was the Upper Three Regions. After entering the Nine Regions, they had actually never thought that there would be a day when they would enter the Upper Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, how far away is the Upper Three Regions?" Hao Tian saw that the land before them still seemed to be endless. They had already entered a dangerous, desolate land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled, "I don't know. How many days have we been travelling?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Somewhere beyond twenty days!" Hao Tian said with a little uncertainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's twenty six days. After today, it'll be twenty seven days." Tang Xi said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took out a map which he had gotten from the Forsaken Heaven City. He looked at the distance on the map and said, smiling "This distance isn't very far. We'll be able to reach the Upper Three Regions soon."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Which part in the Upper Three Regions will we be heading to first?" The Beast King Battle God asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"After passing through the barriers between the Upper Three Regions and the Middle Three Regions, we'll arrive in the Nine Stars Domain. Thereafter, it'd be the Nine Moons Domain followed by the Nine Suns Domain," Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The names don't sound as imposing as the Middle Three Regions' Forsaken Heaven Region and Forsaken Earth Region," The Frail Battle God thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Nine Stars Domain's name came because it has nine very big stars that are Spiritual Qi Stars. The Spiritual Qi there is much stronger than that in the Middle Three Regions and the environment is better as well. As for the Nine Moons Domain, they have nine moons which are a notch higher than the nine stars. The Nine Suns Domain is even stronger than the Nine Moons Domain. A place wouldn't be in the Upper Three Regions just because it had an imposing name," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Nine Stars Domain and the Nine Moons Domain are still alright, but the Nine Suns Domain will definitely be very hot, although it won't affect us much. However, it still doesn't feel good," Nuo Lan smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not sure about that. It's said that the Nine Suns Domain's suns are called Warm Suns and they won't cook the things under them. There are four clear seasons and when it's the cold season, there'll still be snowfall." Qing Shui wasn't worried. This world was far too big. Even if there were 90 suns, the Nine Suns Domain still wouldn't be burned, let alone that there were only nine of them now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some powerful demonic beasts appeared during their travel. They were all at the great perfection stage, but weren't a big deal to Qing Shui's group. Therefore, they killed the demonic beasts with great ease. What Qing Shui was happy about was that he still managed to kill two ancient pure-blooded desolate beasts and refined two Blood Strengthening Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with the Nine Continents Steps, they travelled over two months. A seemingly endless stretch of glow appeared in the sky in the distance, as if hanging in the sky. They weren't above or below each other, but left and right to each other. They appeared to be endless no matter which direction they were facing toward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like the Seven-Colored Mystic Lights—with an intense pressure over the entire area. This was a path that one had to go through to head to the Upper Three Regions. After passing through this place, they would arrive in the Upper Three Regions. However, not everyone would be able to pass through it. Moreover, when they came, the desolate land they passed by was so dangerous that not many would be able to get through it. It could also be considered to be a natural barricade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thankfully, there weren't many restrictions and everyone passed through. The moment they entered, it felt as if they had entered the waters of a whirlpool. In that instant, their consciousness seemed to be blurred out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they woke up, they had the feeling as if it had only been a blink of an eye, yet it also felt as if several hundred thousand years had passed by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Qing Shui got back to his senses, he felt a powerful Qi gushing toward him. This world made one feel even brighter and clearer. At the same time, Qing Shui felt as if his strength had increased by leaps and bounds. There weren't any restrictions that were present in the Forsaken Heaven Region, and everything returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine Stars Domain. This was the Nine Stars Domain. Qing Shui raised his head and looked at the sky before entering a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were nine stars hanging in the sky in a row. Each of them appeared to be the size of a small basin and was bright and luminous. There was a sun in the sky, and it was about the same size as the nine stars, but was only just a little brighter. However, the sun's brightness couldn't hide the nine stars' brilliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's really beautiful. The feeling here is great. It's no wonder that people who have come to the Upper Three Regions aren't willing to leave," Tang Xi said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who told you that people who came to the Upper Three Regions aren't willing to leave?" Hao Tian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I thought of it myself." Tang Xi grinned and then asked Hao Tian, "Don't you like this place?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I do!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The place they arrived at was an endless stretch of the Forest Steppe. However, there weren't many trees in the area and there was only dried grass under their feet. There was also green grass in the area, but they weren't taller than the knee. There were quite a number of boulders and slopes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They couldn't see the barrier here. This meant that if Qing Shui didn't have the Five Elements Divine Flags, he would have some trouble heading back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go and find a place to settle down and then familiarize ourselves with the area." Although Qing Shui had reached the Nurture God Realm, he was only at the first level. He was quite strong, but there should be many monsters in the Upper Three Regions. Someone of his strength was really nothing to some of the people in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surroundings were just an endless stretch, but Qing Shui still headed north. It wouldn't be wrong to head north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, it didn't take them that long. They successfully arrived at a city—the Blue Star City. It belonged to the Ice Star Nation.</span></p>
