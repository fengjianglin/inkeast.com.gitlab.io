 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of Canghai Mingyue. The first time he saw her, he felt as though he were standing on the Golden Winged Thunder Condor, with an imposing air that was absolutely beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quickly, they were able to determine the positions of the Thirteen Carp Kings. Finally, Qing Shui split the work up for five people, in which Jin Liyu was also included, with Qing Shui taking another part naturally, as he was a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the work had been delegated, they had to control them in the shortest amount of time. The three people warned each other to be careful. If they let the Carp Clan make the first move, it wouldn’t be good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui believed that things would go wrong for some reason, but until now it had been going smoothly. The longer these things go, the harder they get.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first place that Qing Shui went to was the living place of Jin Liyu, the Carp Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui got to this water region, the scene he saw was one that dazzled him. There were simply too many handsome men and alluring women. There didn’t seem to be a single bad-looking person in the Carp Clan. Anyone could be said to be a beautiful person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went in with a strut, but he was quickly obstructed. Two young men blocked his path: “The Third Palace Lord doesn’t want to meet anyone. Please return, sir!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was startled. It seemed like that this Jin Liyu had planned from the start, and said, smilingly: “Tomorrow, we shall begin the war with the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace. The third Palace Lord is the Lord of the Sea King Palace. Who am I going to discuss the strategy with? If the actions of the two of you cause us to lose time, the consequences will be hard to bear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two were surprised by Qing Shui’s big talk. It seemed that the Carp Clan didn’t even know who was a friend or a foe, but after a while, Qing Shui thought it made sense since these were only grunts. They would fight whomever their leadership told them to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. I’m not unfriendly towards the Third Lord, as we are brothers. He said that I could come find him at any time, a fact that many people already know. If you guys don’t want to lose your jobs, which is what will most likely happen if you interfere with the business with the Sea King Palace, I suggest you guys think about it as your actions could hinder the Nine Clans,” Qing Shui said this with a smile, slightly scaring them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Third Lord is in the rear court!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed and patted them on the shoulders when he saw their reactions. In actuality, he had hit a pressure point that would make them forget what had happened previously, as well as anything they had seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui needed a little bit of time, so he naturally continued on carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rear court of the Carp Palace didn’t have a single person guarding it, allowing Qing Shui to save a lot of time. Since this was the Carp Palace, there shouldn’t be any passersby, and even if there were, they would try to notify someone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Entering the halls of the palace, what shocked Qing Shui was that in a large hall there was a carp holding a young girl with three women by his side. Two of them were helping Jin Liyu&nbsp;drink wine, of which neither looked too happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui remembered that the Carp Clan was a Clan of infatuation, but after a little thought, he realized that they just had a lot of emotions, which made the sight in front of him appear natural.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Jin Liyu saw Qing Shui, he wasn’t affected at all and instead pushed away the two women near him, laughing: “Brother, when did you come? Why didn’t you tell me beforehand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui put up a smiling expression on his face, seeing the messy sight in front of him, and returned with a laugh: “Tomorrow is a big day, I wanted to come discuss strategies with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he talked and smiled, he moved over to Jin Liyu, who had already rushed his attendants out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu’s face became solemn, but Qing Shui saw in his eyes a hint of urgency. This sense of hurry told Qing Shui that this Carp had most likely leaked to the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What were you thinking, brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui watched Jin Liyu, he suddenly changed the topic: “I fear your complexion doesn’t seem well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s probably just stress, nothing to worry about.” Jin Liyu returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll take your pulse if you don’t mind.” Qing Shui said, smilingly, as he reached his hand out and placed it on Jin Liyu’s veins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then forced his Titan Ox Strength into Jin Liyu’s body, who noticed it too late. Qing Shui’s Titan Ox Strength now is one of the best, sealing the veins of Jin Liyu, who could only be considered as a normal person now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, what is this?” Jin Liyu became frenzied. He knew that he wasn’t capable of fighting Qing Shui. With a bright path ahead of him, he didn’t want anything bad to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third Lord, you are a smart person. You really don’t remember anything you have done.” As Qing Shui said this, he inserted a Gold Needle into his Danzhong point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu was startled. This was a lethal point, but then Qing Shui inserted six needles into the Life Gate, Middle Gate, and other pressure points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my Seven Star Soul Pursuit. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. From now on, I am the only person in the world that can save you. You have three days to live; the choice to live or to die is up to you.” Qing Shui packed up his needles with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he heard this, Jin Liyu had a thought. Now that what he did and what the Carp Clan did was revealed, the betrayal could kill the nine Clans. When he thought about this the Carp’s body was overcome with sweat. If he had to fight Qing Shui it would be extremely dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no use. Even though the Carp Clan with me has some strength, there’s no longer time.” Jin Liyu said defeatedly, shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were up to Qing Shui only, he would have killed Jin Liyu&nbsp;on the spot, but he knew that doing so would lose the crucial support of the Carp Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if I controlled your Thirteen Carp Kings?” Qing Shui said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu became shocked. Before, he thought that there was a possibility of luck, but now that he knew it was all over, he looked up at Qing Shui: “Can you protect my Carp Clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only you can protect your Clan, but that will depend on what you’re going to do. I just don’t understand. Hasn’t the Sea King Palace treated the Carp Clan well enough? Did you really think that you would be able to live better away from the Sea King Palace?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was because I was obsessed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Jin Liyu was concerned about Muyun Qingge, making him feel that it was because he didn’t do enough, cooperating with the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace. Wasn’t this unrealistic? But now Qing Shui didn’t have the heart to understand these things, as all he had to do was to make Jin Liyu cooperate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you return to our sides now, we would still make it. I’m not sure if you’re willing though.” Even though Qing Shui asked this question, he knew that he had already put Jin Liyu&nbsp;in checkmate, and was confident that he wouldn’t do anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do I need to do?” Jin Liyu was convinced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, wait for my message. Remember, your actions will determine the future of you and the Carp Clan. Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. What happens from here on out is up to you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui left as soon as he said it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu&nbsp;didn’t know how Qing Shui would find the other Thirteen Carp Kings. As long as someone leaked the information, he’d be able to kick the Carp Clan out of the Sea King Palace with a great fuss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shadow Goblet’s strength was still very strong, but Qing Shui quickly found four Carps, who didn’t even have the chance to respond to Qing Shui’s attack because Qing Shui had previously taken Jin Liyu’s medallion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui returned to the rendezvous point, Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange were already there and nodded at Qing Shui as he arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now we should be able to have a heart to heart with the Carp Clan,” Qing Shui said after some thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judgment this time went abnormally smoothly. Perhaps, it was because the Life Gate of the Carp Clan had been grasped. The few beasts of the Carp Clan also listened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui actually wasn’t too afraid of them going back on their words. He had already placed formations around the Sea King Palace. Even if they revolted, his personal safety was of no concern. As long as there was time, nothing would be a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Carp Clan was still very frenzied. What demonic Clans hated the most were traitors, perhaps even more so than humans. From the start even if they knew that the Thirteen Carp Kings had been controlled, they would still have decided to revolt against the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Muyun Qingge’s words changed their thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I of the Sea King Palace believe that we have treated the Carp Clan well, but didn’t think that you would do this. I’m very upset, but the events of this time I will not investigate. I hope that the Carp Clan will put in more effort because of what they have done. Honestly, the Carp Clan isn’t strong enough to be independent. If you want to be independent, then I’ll allow it after this time.” Muyun Qingge had a pained expression as she said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Beasts of the Carp Clan also thought that what happened this time was a little too rushed, and they felt like dotards. They already didn’t ask much of what happened within the Clan. They weren’t even told about what happened this time until it had all been decided. They felt that sometimes decisions should be left to the younger ones, or else they might never be independent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they didn’t think that an event like this would happen. All the Old Beasts shrunk over, then the Chief Elder of the Carp Clan said after a huge sigh: “Palace Mistress, we know how to deal with this situation. Even if you decide to execute all of them, we will still defend the Sea King Palace to the death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s words were filled with strength. Qing Shui also felt that what he said was the truth. Perhaps what happened this time was really the idea of the lower ranks. In addition, these Old Beasts didn’t have much to say. Some things deserve to be let go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and his companions came back. As for the Thirteen Carp Kings, their limits were not taken away. The rest of the Carp Clan also didn’t dare to challenge this, even if the limits were withheld forever. There wasn’t much they could do since the wrong they had committed was normally assigned the death penalty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky grew dark. The entire Sea King Palace was more silent than anything else, but on the back of this silence, a storm was brewing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now the Sea King Palace was heavily guarded, with a powerful influence. The Carp Clan became silent as normal. Muyun Qingge’s reasoning was to play by ear. Perhaps it could be used as an edge against the enemy when the time comes. If the enemy was going to take advantage of this then all she needed to do was follow the original plan. As long as the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace were defeated, it didn’t matter what methods were used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From night until dawn, this period of time was when the surroundings of the Sea King Palace became a little dark, but it didn’t change as much as the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water came in torrents. Qing Shui, ever since obtaining Paragon Water Flight, his spiritual sense had grown much stronger in the water, and said lightly as he looked outside: “They’re coming.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge weren’t normal people, and also felt it. They lightly nodded, then rushed over with some people, and let the Carp Clan hold the Sea King Palace as previously planned.</span></p>
