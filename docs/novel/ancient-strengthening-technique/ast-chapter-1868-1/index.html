 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t say anything. He simply looked at him and smiled. Similarly, Qing Hanye also stayed beside Qing Shui and remained silent. However, deep down, she was actually feeling very delighted. For a man to declare a woman to be his under this kind of situation, this would give a major impact on the woman herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked at Qing Shui like he had already seen through him. He observed him for a long time but yet still found it hard to believe that the man in front of him was actually stronger than him. How exactly was he able to get a woman like her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it didn’t mean that his observation skill was awful. He could tell that Qing Hanye was still a virgin. Nevertheless, at times, it might still give him some false pieces of information. For instance, he assumed that all of the women here had pure and sacred bodies. That wasn’t true in the case of Tantai Lingyan and Yiye Jiange. Despite all that, he still believed that their bodies were pure and holy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know that you may not develop any feelings for me now but it is also intolerable of you to come up with such an excuse just to avoid me. I won’t force you to do things you don’t like but do tell me about this man and what he has that’s better than me. This way, at least I can truly give up on you.” The man told Qing Hanye after observing Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he could tell that Qing Hanye was a virgin, at the moment he saw the child, he right away assumed it to be Yiye Jiange’s baby. A man could already be considered to be lucky to have even one of the women here. Hence, he was totally unconvinced that Qing Shui would actually have two or multiples of them at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui got startled and looked at Qing Hanye with a strange look. He had never expected for himself to actually be looked down upon. It had already made clear the meaning behind his words. He thought that Qing Shui wasn’t good enough for Qing Hanye. To make matters worse, the man that was currently opposite him seemed to have a very strong sense of superiority over himself and was under the illusion that he was better than Qing Shui in every aspect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye stared back at Qing Shui. On her face, there seemed to be a faint hint of a smiling expression. This caused Qing Shui to shoot a glare back at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is no point of me avoiding you. I have already made things very clear to you. Please stop bothering me in the future.” This time, Qing Hanye was finally able to see through this man’s talent at being clingy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s your name? Would you dare to have a match against me? Whoever loses must disappear from here immediately.” The man then looked at Qing Shui and challenged him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed to view himself as someone very elegant. Though that was indeed true, from Qing Shui’s perspective, he was merely a fool. He was getting more and more annoyed with the man. By now, he had lost all his positive look about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Golden Sacred Palace, is it? So as it seems, you think very highly of yourself. Have you ever thought that whatever you have today are all given by your ancestors? Have you ever thought about what you would be if the Golden Sacred Palace never existed?” Qing Shui looked at the man as he entrusted Yiye Jiange with Qing Xiu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the man heard that, he turned from smiling to looking very hostile. He stared at Qing Shui and said in a calm tone, “My clan has indeed given me a lot of things. But I dare say that I won’t be that much different even without my clan. It can be considered a kind of strength to be born in a good family background. It’s the same thing as luck. Luck is a source of strength, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “Your honesty is indeed worthy of a praise. Compared to the majority of the children of the rich, you are more clever and less arrogant than them. Unfortunately, what you lack is a bit more personality. Since you want to be so insensible, let me help you accomplish it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go outside. This way, at least we can keep ourselves from destroying the entire area.” The man turned around and started walking outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “Just because you said something like that, I will hold back against you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think too highly of yourself.” The man retorted without even turning back his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, be careful.” Qing Hanye warned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you worried about me? Why not give me a kiss then?” Qing Shui smiled and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Hanye was aware that Qing Shui might just want to agitate the third prince, it was still quite embarrassing for her to do it in front of all the girls. Though they were just one step away from truly kissing, it should still be something that was done in private.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Save it! Just be careful, even though I know that he doesn’t stand a chance against you.” Qing Hanye shot a glance at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he walked outside. He had never bothered to be wary of the third price of Golden Sacred Palace. With his current strength, it was very easy for him to figure out how strong his opponent was. Certainly, his opponent was also able to see through his strength. The only problem was what he revealed to him was just an illusion. This was also one of the reasons why his opponent never bothered to pay any attention to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jin Dao. A pleasure to meet you.” The man opposite Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that the man was announcing his name. This was a habit across the continent. Usually, it was to let their opponents know in whose hands they were defeated by. Or rather, as the saying emphasized, no one would want to die by the hands of someone whom they didn’t even know the name of. This was a culture passed across the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui. My pleasure.” Qing Shui didn’t try to hide anything. There were very few people who actually know his name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two weapons reminiscent of a sword appeared in Jin Dao’s hands. They were both dyed in dark gold. Though that might be the case, they were still quite bright. Glimmering light could be seen shining across the blade of the sword as it gave out chilly killing intentions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His weapon was quite decent. As Qing Shui was observing the opponent’s weapon, he didn’t bring out his own. Though it was said that one must not let their guard down even if they ran into someone significantly weaker than himself, Qing Shui just couldn’t find the need to take out his weapons. To him, there was absolutely no point of taking it out. He was quite confident in himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take out your weapon. Swords have no eyes. I don’t want to take advantage of you.” The man saw Qing Shui without his weapons and said with his brows knitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was, in a way, looking down on his opponents with his actions. This was very disrespectful to a warrior. Hence, Jin Dao was naturally unhappy about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not that I look down on you, it’s just that it won’t be of use for me. In fact, it will just be inconvenient for me to take it out. Just bring it on!” Qing Shui shook his head and made a gesture which challenged him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are digging your own grave, don’t regret it!” Jin Dao was enraged by Qing Shui. He shouted out loudly as he crisscrossed both his swords and slashed it at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten Formidable Martial Skills, Ten Directional Slaughter! Cross Slash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two dark golden colored sword afterimages were like a solid substance as they gave out a bright and golden light. The light was dazzling as it chopped its way towards Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t move. He watched as Jin Dao approached him. At this moment, an enormous lobster emerged in his eyes. Those two golden swords’ afterimages were precisely his claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a real kind of illusion. Jin Dao was someone who carried the bloodline of the Five-headed Lobster King. However, from what Qing Shui felt, at the moment, Jin Dao was only a Single-headed Lobster King. He seemed to still lack quite a significant amount of firepower. Nevertheless, he could definitely be considered one of the peak existence among those Single-headed ones.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was like an entity that could never be surpassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
