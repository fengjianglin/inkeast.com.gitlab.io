 <p><strong>AST 748 - Tianyuan Inn, Tantai Xianzi, World Cleansing Demonic Lotus</strong></p>
 <p>Three months later!</p>
 <p>After three months of going through a harsh journey, the Southern Viewing Continent was within sight and this was still after the Fire Bird went through a significant increase in speed. If not, the journey would have been much longer.</p>
 <p>The closer they got to the Southern Sky, the warmer the weather got. The forest also got thicker. Along the way, they didn’t run into any trouble. After all, there were other people also taking the flight path they took.</p>
 <p>During the past three months, Qing Shui rushed through his journey in daytime and rested at night. He would also cultivate from time to time. They spent most of the time in the sky. During his free time, he would either spend it by chatting with the others or reading ‘Poison Scriptures’.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui arrived at the Southern Viewing Continent, Qing Shui could already sense a kind of living energy. The aura was a lot more powerful here than on other continents. It has always been said that Southern Viewing Continent had concentrated Nature Energy. It was a place that produced expensive medicinal herbs and precious beasts. Even the quality of human’s skin would improve when they were here. Hence, most of the beautiful girls would be found here.</p>
 <p>And also, the people here lived longer lives. It was comparable to the Village of Longevity. Hence, Southern Viewing Continent was almost at the same level as Central Continent in terms of having both good and bad people mixed together.</p>
 <p>“Old Master, we’re finally here.” Qing Shui pointed towards the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent which was already within sight and smiled at Cang Wuya.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, even though three months weren’t really that long, it was still one of the longest journey I have ever been through. I have never thought of being able to set foot in Southern Viewing Continent again.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, actually it's still possible to visit every single one of the continent across the World of the Nine Continents but it’d be a bit difficult if you’re talking about walking through every part of them. If I get a chance in the future, I’d definitely take you to walk past the entire World of the Nine Continents.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’m already really happy to hear you say that. I'm old, I don't really care about anything anymore. I only hope that you can walk with all of them happily and have more babies together. Every time I look at the two children, I feel as if I just saw Canghai and my son.” Cang Wuya said peacefully.</p>
 <p>“Old Master, what’s happened has happened, Senior Canghai is your child, Mingyue is your granddaughter. We’re all a family.” Qing Shui meant what he said.</p>
 <p>“I know, I'm glad that I'm so lucky. The wisest thing that Canghai did was passing Mingyue to you.” Cang Wuya chuckled.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya was Old Ancestor’s disciple, the same goes with Bai Gui. Fei Wuji was Old Ancestor’s grandson and at the same time also Cang Wuya’s disciple. In this kind of Master-disciple relationship, the master was his father.</p>
 <p>Other than being actual relatives, the people at the back of the Fire Bird shared the closest relationship with each other. Let alone Qing Shui being someone who took comradeship seriously, he didn’t have many close relatives or friends, he really treasured the people around him. Hence, he would do his best to protect the people around him. Or else he would not have come to Southern Viewing Continent.</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor had done him a huge favor before. Hence, no matter how one sees it, he would still have to do something regarding this matter but within his capability. For now, he wasn’t allowed to die yet because there were too many people who needed to rely on him.</p>
 <p>Tianyuan City!</p>
 <p>This was a city that was located at the edge of Southern Viewing Continent. Its city wall was built significantly higher and there were unusually more people patrolling the city. Additionally, flying beasts could also be seen constantly patrolling the sky. From time to time, resounding beast cries and bird chirping noises would be heard.</p>
 <p>Considering that it was located at the edge of the continent, half of the people would stop here to replenish themselves either before leaving or upon entering the continent. Both the hotels and restaurants would be packed with people.</p>
 <p>The economic system here was particularly diverse. Added on that this place was really disordered, murderers could escape the continent easily. Hence, both the people and the aristocratic clans here were quite powerful. Also, there were those who took the risk to work here. After all, the more disorderly a place was, the easier it was to earn money there.</p>
 <p>“Let’s take a break in Tian Yuan City for a while and investigate the situation here before setting off.” QIng Shui said gently.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya and the others nodded. Normally, Qing Shui would still be the one to make decisions unless he was being hesitant, Cang Wuya and the others would provide him with suggestions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put away the Fire Bird and the group immediately descended on the Tianyuan Balcony of Tianyuan City. Across the World of the Nine Continents, only formidable warriors were allowed to travel back and forth through the nine continents as they wished. Ordinary caravans would have to pay road fare at the city gate. Of course, it would be a different scenario if there was a powerful warrior among them.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, send us to the biggest restaurant nearby.” Qing Shui stopped a beast cart and asked the middle-aged driver.</p>
 <p>“No problem!” The middle-aged man yelled and made the beast cart move extremely fast.</p>
 <p>Tian Yuan Inn!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Cang Wuya got off the cart and stood in front of the luxurious and grand restaurant. Qing Shui looked at the words “Tianyuan Inn” on the building and had a feeling that the owner of the restaurant was somewhat related with the strongest force in Tianyuan City. If not for that, he wouldn’t have dared to use the words “Tianyuan “.</p>
 <p>Other than looking splendorous and majestic, the inn also had a sort of graceful ambiance to it. This place was just like a pavilion, every single one of its floors had all four sides opened wide. This might have had something to do with the weather of the southern part of the continent.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of people walking back and forth in front of Tianyuan Inn. Warriors, merchants, all kinds of people. There were a lot of girls and guys as well, some in groups of three to five whereas some would just walk alone.</p>
 <p>“Misters, please come in.” In the moment Qing Shui was walking past the wide doorway, a man around forty years of age came out of the restaurant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He nodded and followed the man into the restaurant.</p>
 <p>The man had a well proportioned build and an average height. However, his body looked really tight, his muscles weren’t that large but they looked really solid and had decent explosive strength.</p>
 <p>He was a person who cultivated his body. One of the higher grade waiters who served customers was already at the state of cultivating his muscles. There were more people who cultivated their body than people who cultivated their qi across the World of the Nine Continents, the reason being that it was more difficult to cultivate qi.</p>
 <p>“Misters, please come up.” The man once again said politely when he reached the stairs.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui responded politely. After that, he observed the internal situation of Tianyuan Inn. The first floor was already fully packed with people, most of which were merchants. However, one could tell that they were rich people with just one glance.</p>
 <p>The tables and chairs in the room were all made of expensive dark green woods. The entire hall was dark green colored, making people feel unusually comfortable. Beautiful waitresses could also be seen walking back and forth in the hall.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He was unable to break the custom. This world was made of both males and females. One attracts the other and divides up their work with one another. As time passed, it had become an unwritten rule.</p>
 <p>There were a total of nine floors in Tianyuan Inn. Nine was the maximum number in the World of the Nine Continents, hence, very few buildings would have more than nine floors. However, they would make each floor taller. Thus, even for the very tall building, they were still only nine floors.</p>
 <p>They walked up to the second floor, but the middle-aged waiter didn’t stop walking and proceeded straight up to the third floor. The second floor was also already full with people. The areas of each of the floors in was around ten thousand meters. It had both length and width of about a hundred meters.</p>
 <p>One would be able to smell the aroma here even from a hundred Lis away. Upon walking into the restaurant itself, the fragrance only became even thicker. It was average in terms of both its environment and its location.</p>
 <p>It could basically already be confirmed that all the warriors were on the third floor. There were finally empty seats, even though there were only a few of them. The man continued to bring Qing Shui and his group all the way up to the fourth floor.</p>
 <p>The fourth floor was totally different compared to the other three floors. It was one third smaller in size. The area decreased as one progressed higher up. The top floor was only about a few hundred metres.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, there were very few people here. There were about 90%people fewer than the lower floor.</p>
 <p>“Please take a seat.” The man told Qing Shui and the others to sit down.</p>
 <p>There weren’t many people here. Furthermore, they were at the side of the room because from their position, they could see the outside scenery. It was quite a satisfying experience to be able to look at the lower ground from a higher position.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw a few more seats at the far east side of the floor. He gave a few hints and settled down there. After that, he smiled at the waiter and said: “Please serve me the best food and wine that you offer here.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, give me a moment please.”</p>
 <p>After the man left, Qing Shui calmly observed the warriors who were having their meals nearby. There were some with the ability of a Xiantian while there were some who were at Martial King Grade. Moreover, he also felt that there were two warriors at Peak Martial King.</p>
 <p>“I heard that a treasure was discovered in the Southern Sea and it was obtained by Fairy Tantai. This time, Tantai Clan is going to be even stronger.” A middle-aged man not so far away said with a face full of admiration.</p>
 <p>“Fairy Tantai? A valuable treasure?” The man on the opposite side seemed a bit confused.</p>
 <p>“Lang Yi, don’t tell me you haven’t heard of Fairy Tantai?” The man from before looked at the slightly younger man opposite him in surprise.</p>
 <p>“I do know about her, the most gifted girl in Tantai Clan so far. She managed to achieve Peak Martial King strength in her coming of age ceremony with her unique body and officially became a Martial Saint at eighteen. She even managed to achieve Peak Martial Saint at twenty five years of age. Now that eight years have passed, no one knows exactly just how strong she has become. The one I’m uncertain of is the valuable treasure.” The man with the name Lang Yi said hurriedly.</p>
 <p>“It’s said that a World Cleansing Demonic Lotus has appeared in Southern Sea and legend has it that it was absorbed by Fairy Tantai. Not only that, she even managed to comprehend the World Cleansing Flame and Demonic Lotus Platform.” The middle-aged man said eagerly.</p>
 <p>“What are they?” Lang Yi continued questioning in confusion.</p>
 <p>“Legend has it that it’s a kind of flame in the world that is capable of burning everything and could deal devastating damage to wicked things. She is already a person who is resistant to all types of poisons. I’m uncertain about the strength of the World Cleansing Flame. But it’s said to be really powerful. As for the Demonic Lotus Platform, it’s just the same as a flying beast. Zero consumption and it’s speed is said to be one of the top in the world. Legend has it that her strength will be multiplied a number of times when she is on it. It could also help reduce her exhaustion by a few fold.” The man said eagerly.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, Qing Shui’s heart thumped. If what the person said was real, then that was a true precious treasure. The one fold increase provided by his own Thunder God was already really satisfying… But this was by several fold…….</p>
 <p>Also, Qing Shui wanted to know who this Fairy Tantai was. Was Tantai Clan a supreme aristocratic clan? It seemed like the two really admired that person.The woman that they talked about previously also sounded incomparably gifted.</p>
 <p>At this moment, two women approached him with food and alcohol. The man from before also walked towards him and after politely serving him the food, he took his leave.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened up the alcohol, The alcohol here was brewed by Pear Blossom and the name of the alcohol was called the Pear Blossom Fragrance. It was the most famous alcohol here,</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui opened it, a thick pear blossom fragrance rushed into his nose. It was something that had been brewed for at least fifty years. To Qing Shui, fifty years might sound like nothing, but to others, it was a really long time.</p>
