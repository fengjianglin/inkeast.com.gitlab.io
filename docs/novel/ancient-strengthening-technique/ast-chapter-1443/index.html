Qing Shui was completely stunned the instant she glanced back at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was once been said that a beauty’s smile from a backward glance could entrance a hundred. However, the woman did not smile, she just simply looked back. That instant when she glanced backward, her beauty was indescribable. Her cool and elegant demeanor that encompasses an unspeakable tenderness made the scene as if it came out from a painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman had already disappeared from his sight, but Qing Shui took a while before he came back to his senses. Beauty was a form of art. Real beauty would appear when it was least expected. That moment was so beautiful, so beautiful to the point that he felt that it took a while before his soul returned to his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Real attractiveness did not require seductive fox-like charms. Just like Tantai Lingyan, cool and elegance could also be attractive to the point of drawing the attention of many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the second day, a group of people rushed towards one direction. People would naturally scour the surroundings now that they were within the Ancient Ruins. However, this region was extremely dangerous, even if there were many treasures to be found, they had to put their life on the line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, the Demon Lord, and Hua Rumei’s strength rapidly increased. In addition to their beasts’ strength, their confidence was also correspondingly enhanced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Sound Sect were leaving the area and before they left they said their goodbyes to the Demon Lord Palace. Hua Rumei acted friendly towards them, while Shen Ling tried to flirt a couple more times with Qing Shui before leaving. He did not know what this bewitching woman was actually thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few of the Justice Alliance left as well, but some remained to look for treasures. Perhaps they were trying if they could find another Ancient Divine Shrine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was just a thought. People knew that in reality there were not that many Ancient Divine Shrine as each shrine would represent someone of importance. The items inside these shrines would all be decent treasures. One Ancient Divine Shrine could bring a sect to new heights by making some people into formidable martial artists, especially if an inheritance was involved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the Battle God Inheritance that was passed on to Qing Shui. It was as though the Inheritance was tailor-made for him, there was nothing more fitting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they walked for some time, he could see that the Divine Beast Sect kept their distance from their group, Qing Shui laughed as he looked at the two women, Zhan Yu and Jin Ci.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Divine Beast Sect already had an Inheritance from long ago, they have a good foundation. Do you think they will fight us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Divine Beast Sect existed for a long time and they are known for their ‘dog-eat-dog’ attitude. Now that they know we got some treasures from the Ancient Divine Shrine, they will probably take their chances and not let us go easily.” Hua Rumei said seemingly unconcerned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Older sister is not afraid?” Qing Shui said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What am I afraid of? No one can make me afraid. Don’t I have you and the Palace Lord here? Who could stop us now?” Hua Rumei’s words seem to be hinting her desire for someone to take action against them…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had originally thought of using the Nine Continents Step, but seeing the bad intentions of the Divine Beast Sect, he decided not to use his Nine Continents Steps or even summoning his beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Ancient Ruins had quite a bit of good stuff around and it could even be easily founded. These included some very rare and precious medicinal herbs that people who were not experts in the field would regard as trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was because medicinal herbs that were not aged to a certain degree were considered trash, but it was extremely valuable once it was aged to the proper degree. The most important property was if people wanted to transfer them, it would be impossible to keep it alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From these medicinal herbs, Qing Shui discovered two ingredients that were needed for the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and Fortune Golden Pellet. He directly transferred them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He chose the ones that have been aged to a certain degree, such as those that were hundreds of years old to 2000 years old. Even with those, the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and Fortune Golden Pellet required medicinal herbs of at least 10,000 years in age, thus no one would wait for the remaining 8,000 years. Therefore, those people treated these medicinal herbs as scraps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui was happy to look for more herbs to transplant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two women were intelligent. From one glance, they could already figure out what Qing Shui was doing. The answer was so simple that it was somewhat hard to believe. However, they deduced that Qing Shui had a heavenly technique that could refine the medicinal effects from the medicinal herbs and utilize it for refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them did not ask anything. Hua Rumei only asked Qing Shui what kind of medicinal herbs he was looking for and even made him draw what they looked like. She asked the others to help find the medicinal herbs. Qing Shui did not hesitate, he told them directly that they were herbs required to refine the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and Fortune Golden Pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhan Yu and Jin Ci were especially eager to help. Qing Shui had spent Yang Pellets, Origin Returning Pill, Acupuncture, and what not to help raise their strength during this time. Moreover, he had saved Zhan Yu and Hua Rumei’s lives, and also assisted Jin Ci in revitalizing his looks. Now, Jin Ci had given up on pursuing the Demon Lord and no longer had the desire to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Helping Qing Shui was helping themselves, this was an easy to understand logic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui summoned and released all of his Jade Emperor Bees. If there were any problems, he would be the first to know. This area was still within the Ancient Ruins, anything could happen. Moreover, the probability of something happening would be high. Most people would leave immediately if they had no need to stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day had passed and they were lucky that no incidents occurred. It was a rare, serene day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This quiet day usually wouldn’t allow people to relax because this sort of situation would never end in a good thing. This situation could only occur if they entered a formidable beast’s territory, otherwise, they should be able to see other beasts around. It was impossible for not even one to show up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui was very confident, he was slightly worried that there would be a large number of formidable beasts. However, with his Nine Continents Step and the detection of the Jade Emperor Bees, he was ready for anything. If the situation called for it, he would immediately open the way for the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Qing Shui bewildered was that the Jade Emperor Bees detected a large group of the Divine Beast Sect members that were following them from afar. Moreover, there were two other forces that were also following him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile appeared on Qing Shui’s lips. If this was the case, then he’ll borrow their hands to slay the other forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that he was not the only one who thought of this. The other forces must be thinking the same thing, especially those in the Divine Beast Sect. With their spiritual sense, they should be able to feel the dangers in this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this was the case, they still came here, meaning they were confident with themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heart of Demonic Beast?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui suddenly realized where the problem lies, the two Lu Brothers were the key since they had the Heart of Demonic Beast. They were confident that in the situation where they met formidable beasts, they could use the beast to their advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of Luan Luan. The Heart of Demonic Beast was not inferior to the Heart of Seven Orifices. Even when Luan Luan was small, formidable beasts would still be friendly towards her, to the point where they would follow her orders. The Lu Brothers were also formidable in strength, in addition to their cultivation on the Divine Beast Possession, the formidable False God beasts would also not make things difficult for them.</span></p>

If he wanted to kill people with the hands of others, he would need to eliminate the Lu Brothers first. Moreover, there were the other two forces. They were maybe also aware and they would probably have some sure-kill technique. So much so that, they would even fight the Lu Brothers head on.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Ci did not hesitate, as someone who was a head within the Demon Lord Palace, his strength was definitely not weak. After consuming this Nine Revolution Golden Pellet, his strength would be a lot stronger.</span></p>

Hopefully, you, Brother Jin, and I would be able to assist the Demon Lord Palace in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For the Demon Lord Palace, I could even give up my life,” Jin Ci said with confidence.</span></p>

I had endured all the previous hardships. The Demon Lord Palace is my family and for family, I will put everything on the line.” Zhan Yu said amiably, but anyone who heard what he said would know he meant every word he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After two had consumed the medicinal pellets, they looked at Qing Shui strangely. They noticed that their strength had doubled, this was too terrifying…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that there would be danger soon after, having more strength on their side was always good. Moreover, these two were the Demon Lord Palace’s capable confidants, they would not hold any disloyalty towards the Demon Lord Palace. Thus, after he thought for a bit, Qing Shui decided to give the last two Nine Revolution Golden Pellets to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them were intelligent, given Qing Shui’s earlier words and his relationship with the Demon Lord, they did not have to say much. Let alone, they had always been this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhan Yu and Jin Ci’s strength doubled. Zhan Yu’s strength was similar to Hua Rumei’s, a bit over 50 million sun, while Jin Ci’s strength was closing to 50 million sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, the Demon Lord Palace’s strength was not something to look down upon. During this time, the Battle Pavilion and the Secret Service Pavilion’s total strength had also increased continuously. Once they complete the new formation, their strength would be completely changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days passed by in a blink of an eye. These last three days were peaceful, but the Jade Emperor Bees started to alert them that they had found traces of a giant Ancient Beast. They were really within a type of formidable beast’s territory, and it would seem that it was a nest of sorts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancient Golden Eye Dragon Ape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This area was the territory of the Ancient Golden Eye Dragon Apes. Ancient Golden Eye Dragon Apes were a type of Alpha Dragon Species but also an Ancient Rare Species. Their bodies were huge and their strength was formidable. With all four limbs touching the ground and an ape’s head with dragon horns, they could bulldoze a small hill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through the Jade Emperor Bee’s lookout, they detected over a hundred Ancient GoldenEye Dragon Apes. This was certainly a terrifying power. Moreover, their distance from the Divine Beast Sect and the other two forces were not very far apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that the Ancient Golden Eye Dragon Apes had already felt their existence. He had everyone gather around, then retrieved the ‘Rage Bombs’ he had refined during this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rage Bomb was a product of Qing Shui’s refinement. It was a strange object refined from ingredients such as Skyfire Pepper, Demonic Stink Bug, Stifled Heart Flower, and many more. Moreover, wrapped in the center was a Rage Fruit. Once this thing exploded, it would enrage the surrounding creatures. They would not be able to control the anger and rage within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui waited. Once the other groups’ distance got closer, he suddenly appeared in the vicinity of the other two groups and threw several Rage Bombs at them. Immediately afterward, he blinked over to the Ancient Golden Eye Dragon Apes’ area and threw a lot of Rage Bombs at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All was well, it was just like they had poked a wasp’s nest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roarrrrr……</span></p>

The direction they headed towards would pass by the Divine Beast Sect.</span></p>

He threw out several Rage Bombs at the Divine Beast Sect, the members immediately reacted as if they were hens who had their chicks stolen from them.</span></p>
