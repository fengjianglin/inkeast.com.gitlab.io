He and his companions had no idea of the Beast God Sect’s strength. Truly, they had never seen them in a terrifying light before, which had resulted in their underestimation of the Beast God Sect’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also normal for their opponents to underestimate the strength of their group. They are able to boost their strength to a terrifying degree, even without considering their trump cards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, as it should be. In that case, Lingyan, how strong do you feel our opponents’ strength are?” Qing Shui smiled as he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan had already gotten used to how Qing Shui addressed her. Even if she hadn’t gotten used to it, there was nothing she could do either...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

However, it wasn’t very near either. But with powerful flying mounts, the distance couldn’t be considered too bad. During the second day, Qing Shui, Tantai Lingyan, Hua Rumei, Zhan Yu and the Battle Pavilion all headed out towards the Divine Sound Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not only is the Beast God Sect participating, there might be other forces too.” Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan were mounted upon Qing Shui’s Hellfire Phoenix. Hua Rumei and Yu Zhan naturally sat on the Ancient Fire Snake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even the Wild Ghost Valley is participating?” Qing Shui stared at Tantai Lingyan in bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you not know?” Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you put it like that, I guess it’s true. In any case, the Wild Ghost Valley should also be a power that is part of the demon king inheritance right? How many inheritances does the demon king have in the Nine Continents?” Qing Shui was very curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The world is too vast, so nobody has the exact numbers. I guess the number shouldn’t be fewer than four figures. Since you managed to obtain the Battle God Inheritance, you should also know some stuff about this right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah. The Battle God of that era had thousands of inheritances. Even if some were lost in the river of time, there would still be plenty of them remaining.” Qing Shui instantly thought of the wealthy families from his past life. There were some who were destined to be extraordinary from the moment of their birth. They didn't need to contend for things. Sometimes, just being born would grant them things others failed to obtain after fighting for their entire lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Wild Ghost Valley is precisely an inheritance from the Devil King. The four powers were determined by everyone else to be evil simply because of one reason: they were sects formed from inheritances of the Devil King.” Tantai Lingyan stared at Qing Shui and said an answer which astonished him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s truly surprising. Seems like everyone of them likes to keep a low profile, causing us to underestimate them.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just see the situation then. The Divine Sound Sect isn’t so simple. Back then, the Sound Demon Lord was extremely terrifying and no one dared to offend him.” Tantai Lingyan stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui and the others saw the Divine Sound Sect, Qing Shui was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Sound Sect was located at the top of a misty mountain. From afar, its beauty was simply breathtaking, exuding a faint sense of immortality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Green peaks and flowing water could be seen everywhere, and the vegetation here was lush and thick. There was a powerful force of vitaliy in the area accompanied by the melodious chirpings from the birds which caused one to feel tranquility. The sounds intermingled with the flowing water and the rustling of leaves, constituting the beautiful sound of nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s talent in sound could be considered above average. Listening to the tranquil voice of nature would truly calm one’s heart down. For ordinary people, even a mass murderer would feel the impulse to lay down his butcher knife if he could hear this wondrous music of nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no sounds of combat, and no people from the Beast God Sect and the Wild Ghost Valley. Very quickly, &nbsp;several women could be seen in the distance ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing the people of Demon Lord Palace coming, the woman in the lead happily welcomed them with a smile, “You guys are here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Leader Shen, why don’t we see those people from the Beast God Sect and Wild Ghost Valley here?” Hua Rumei smiled as she asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are already camping at the boundary 300 miles away. This time, the situation isn’t optimistic for us. They are waiting for the old monsters from their sects before they act.” The woman in the lead spoke in a worried tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know that the Divine Sound Sect also has their own reserves? If we join forces, we need not be afraid of them.” Hua Rumei spoke in a relaxed tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of them rested at the foot of the mountain where the Divine Sound Sect was situated. There had never been a man to climb this mountain, according to their customs. There were several peaks nearby which were used specially for men to stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Hua Rumei initially could go into the Divine Sound Sect but they chose not to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very relaxed. He, Zhan Yu and the experts from the Battle Pavilion chatted their time away. Among them, there were quite a few who had hidden illnesses and chose this time to bring them up. Qing Shui didn’t put on any airs and helped them to cure the illnesses easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was the closest to people from the Demon Lord Palace. Now, he was already a pavilion chief of the Medical Pavilion. The old monster has passed him the position around half a year ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The social connections of physicians were all extremely good. For those doctors with weaker skills, they would have good social connections in low-level social circles. For those with stronger skills, they would have good social connections in higher-level social circles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui originally was a doctor and was also a Devil Chief from the Twelve Earthly Branch of the Demon Lord Palace. In addition to that, there are some vague feelings between him and the Demon Lord. Now, there were many in the Demon Lord Palace who already sensed something between them, although they wouldn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan still had a very good reputation in the Demon Lord Palace no matter what. There were many people who treated her like a goddess. The reason for their existence was all because of her. This woman was the pillar of the Demon Lord Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, come and take a look at my formation and tell me what you think.” Zhan Yu suddenly spoke with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle Blood Formation had been modified by Qing Shui. Now, it had been several years since that point. It seemed like there must have been some results or Zhan Yu wouldn’t have spoken like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, get the brothers to set up the formation then.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few hundred members from the Divine Battle Hall of the Battle Pavilion directly set up the formation. A towering killing qi rose up the sky, as sharp as the edge of blades even before the modifications he had made. However, Qing Shui did make an addition of the dao of combination into this formation. Now, it was much stronger than before. The might it could generate had explosively increased several fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Tantai Lingyan and Hua Rumei walked over. Hua Rumei’s eyes twinkled with laughter as they chatted while Tantai Lingyan nodded as she listened. From the start until the end, Tantai Lingyan’s expression was always cool and collected.</span></p>

Since they knew the Demon Lord Palace was participating, they wished to have a competition that was split into five rounds. The first four rounds would be solo battles while the last round would be a group battle. However, the people participating cannot exceed fifteen. If these terms were agreeable, they could accept them. But if they are not, the opponent would directly launch an attack.</span></p>

Before this, the Divine Sound Sect had already discussed matters with her and Hua Rumei. No matter what, they still had to discuss with Qing Shui first before they made any decisions.</span></p>
