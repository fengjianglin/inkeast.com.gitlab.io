 <p><strong>Chapter 508 Strength of a Martial Saint, Death, Living for another day.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 508 - Strength of a Martial Saint, Death, Living for another day</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing knew that this ‘Sky Tyrant Lord’ was a person who would do what he says, thus she paled and quickly said: “Uncle Tian, I am already his woman……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing lowered her head after saying that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui almost vomited, what was she saying…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Silly girl, you are bad at lying, why are you trying to lie to your uncle Tian?” The man said softly to Huang Qing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From their conversation, Qing Shui felt that Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and Huang Qing’s clan were family friends.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing bit her lips: “Uncle, I did lie to you, but he is the person that Di Chen likes.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was stumped, Di Chen is the Misty Hall Palace Mistress. The man addressed Huang Qing as Di Qing earlier, how was she related to the Misty Hall Palace Mistress? Furthermore, they seemed to bear a remarkable resemblance to each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Who was this man to the Misty Hall Palace Mistress?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Father?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Probably not?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Master?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, he is the master of that guardian I killed, that guardian was the senior brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, it seems that this person should be the master of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress.” Qing Shui wildly guessed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But what led Qing Shui to be surprised was that Huang Qing’s surname was Di!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I knew all of you are here, too bad Chen`er died, that girl should be here as well.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alas, I want to see what is so good about this fellow, that she would give up my son.” That man stared sharply at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing sighed, her elder sister was older than her by a few year, furthermore, her mother died early. When she was young, she was taken away by the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, the Di Clan and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord was planning to strengthen their ties via marriage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Di Chen mother did not die early, then it could have been Huang Qing instead.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s thought deeply about this, She and Di Chen were half-sisters with the same father. They were both from the Di Chan and when Di Chen’s mother passed away, she left a daughter. Coincidentaly, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord was looking for an alliance via marriage, thus things were set as such and Di Chen was taken away to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As she grew older, The Sky Tyrant Lord noticed that this girl was a cultivating genius, even his own son was inferior to her. He originally planned for them to nurture feelings for each other as they grew up, but in the end, it became a one-sided love on his son’s part.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were many people who fancied Di Chen in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, Lin Yuchen was one of them but when he tried to make a move on her, he was almost killed by her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, she left the Central Continent in order to avoid the son of the Sky Tyrant Lord and she somehow ended up in the Greencloud Continent, she only wanted to find a quiet and peaceful place. When she discovered that Lin Yuchen was the guardian of Sword Tower, she immediately entered the Heavenly Palace without hesitation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing was the young miss of Di Clan, thus she had been trying to establish a good relation with Di Chen and also came to the Greencloud Continent. Since Di Chen entered the Heavenly Palace, she could only enter Sword Tower, because aside from friends, enemies are the ones who will interact with each other the most.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only, she did not expect Lin Yuchen to die in Qing Shui’s hands, and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord would shield their own people at all cost. The Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord needed to use Qing Shui as an example to uphold their reputation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt uncomfortable standing there, this man caused him to feel afraid!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Martial Saint, a legendary existence in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young man, you should have thought of this day when you killed my disciple.” the Sky Tyrant Lord also had a personal agenda, Qing Shui not only killed his disciple, but most importantly, he heard that his daughter likes him, thus regardless of work or personal, he had to kill him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I only killed those who had to be killed, if the Sky Tyrant Lord wants to use his strength to suppress the weak, then go ahead.” Qing Shui had already formed his own opinions about him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young man, having a sharp mouth is useless, I have never cared about the words of weaklings, I only believe in strength.” the man looked at Qing Shui disdainfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he was in trouble today, He wanted to hide in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal but he did not want to do so before even exchanging blows. He had to see how far he was from a Martial Saint, Qing Shui was actually some what excited at being able to exchange blows with a Martial Saint.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His originally suppressed vigor circulated once again, raising it was to its peak in an instant, then he climbed onto the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he even stuck the Heavenly Talisman on himself once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But to that man it looked disdainful, he even looked at Qing Shui in distaste.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finished all these in an instant, then looked at the middle-aged man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young Man, on the account of your courage, make your move, or else you will not even have the chance to.” the man said empty-handed, exuding a domineering air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, don’t move, you will die!” Huang Qing shook her head at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you think that he won’t die if he doesn’t move?” The man casually said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Tian……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Girl, the words said by this Sky Tyrant Lord here have to be done, even if the Heavenly Emperor was here, I still have to do it!” the man released a strong pressure, causing the people around to retreat about 10 steps.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young man, make you move, I will not say this for a third time, treasure the chance you have before you regret it.” The man took a step towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With just this step, he caused an enormous pressure to descend on the earth, it felt like a dragon was rushing towards Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Roar!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Prrrrttt!!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under this enormous pressure, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant let loose a cry!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After sticking a few Heavenly Talismans onto the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Qing Shui stared at the Violet Gold Divine Shield!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Godly Armor Shield!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Able to defend against 50% of the opponent’s attack for 1 hour!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Defense doubles for 1 hour!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt much safer!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui used the Emperor's Qi, the man was clearly shocked. When Qing Shui’s released his pressure, his eyes brightened.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He needs to die!” the man immediately thought!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ming!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a clear bird cry from afar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man’s face changed, then he agilely climbed onto the big eagle and used one hand to send out a black cloud towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This speed was very fast, if one blinked, they would miss it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not care about anything else and struck with all his might using the Violet Gold Divine Shield, anticipating a repulsion effect and an increase of 20 percent to his attacking strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Bang……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An ear-splitting dull gong resounded, the surrounding mountains crumbled and the immediate surroundings had sand flying everywhere as though a huge sandstorm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A huge fissure the size of a mountain appeared when the two of them came into contact and in an instant, the area with 100 meters became hell, there was sand flying around as well as strong energy fluctuations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With this first contact, Qing Shui knew that the distance between himself and that man was like heaven and earth, even with the Violet Gold Divine Shield dissipating 50 percent of the attack and the Seven Star Armored Vest doubling his defense and the Man Elephant Unison increasing his strength, it amounted to nothing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s body was like a kite with a broken string, he was in mid-air vomiting blood, his meridians were broken, his organs were ruptured and he felt like he was being drained off his blood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall Palace Mistress had rushed over to check out the situation, but instead, she saw Qing Shui body flying away…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Girl, he killed Chen`er!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He deserves to die!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress slowly moved towards the bloodied Qing Shui. She was dressed in snow white clothes and her shadow seemed lonely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel his life force disappearing quickly, he hurriedly took out a Five Dragon Pellet and swallowed it. The Five Dragon Pellet had another effect aside from curing poisons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Regardless of how heavy the damage, he would be able to withstand it for 24 hours.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for the Great Revitalizing Pellet, Qing Shui found that with his current heavy injuries, it would be useless. Qing Shui knew that the Great Revitalizing Pellet had not reached the level of reviving the dead.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a bitter smile on his face. He had believed that with all his strength, items and skills, her would be able to withstand at least one blow, if not, he would have the time to go into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, but in the end, the results caused Qing Shui to be stunned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How is this fellow so good? Since you are able to prolong your life by a day, I will let you have that day.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress looked at that middle-aged man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Those who kill people from my Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord must die!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What if I’m the one killing them?” The Sky Tyrant Lord stood in between Qing Shui and the man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“From today onwards, I’m never returning to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder sister!” Huang Qing called disappointedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have nothing to do with the Di Clan, no one from the Di clan is related to me.” the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord turned around to face the immobile Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This person who she had saved twice, was dying again because of her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It does not matter what the cause was or who was the killer, this was all because of her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Two clear drops of tears fell!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the first time she had cried was because of him, is it because he was going to die? From the first time she met him in the dream, to the point where she saw some hope in him, she had a special feeling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For him, are you going to disown your godfather? Xuan`er misses you……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tell him to give up. If you still want me to acknowledge you as godfather then go back and never come looking for me again.” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress said quietly, as she carried Qing Shui up, her white clothes quickly stained by Qing Shui’s blood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I’ll bring you back to the Heavenly Palace, you will be fine!” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress looked quietly looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her face was covered by a veil, her beautiful black pupils were wet, maybe because the dying Qing Shui, to her lonely self, might be her only friend.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There is no point, just put me down, let me see the heaven and earth of this mundane world!” Qing Shui said weakly, the effect of the Five Dragon Pellet had activated.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s armed and ribs were all broken…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not satisfied, he still had not accomplished what he wanted to do yet…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of his mother in the Hundred Miles City, he was crying, in the final moments of his life, he could not see his mother, what would she do if she knew he was dead.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There is also Qing Qing, he had just returned to the Qing Clan, she had not interacted a lot with him. If he died, what would the Qing Clan do…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Liu-Li, Wenren Wu-shuang, Canghai Mingyue…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui looked that the absolute beauty carrying him, he took out a pair of earrings stained with his blood, it was the Silver Moon Wolf Earrings.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I still owe you a pair of earrings, all I can give you now is this!”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">If Di Chen mother did not die early, then it could have been Huang Qing instead.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huang Qing’s thought deeply about this, She and Di Chen were half-sisters with the same father. They were both from the Di Chan and when Di Chen’s mother passed away, she left a daughter. Coincidentaly, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord was looking for an alliance via marriage, thus things were set as such and Di Chen was taken away to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As she grew older, The Sky Tyrant Lord noticed that this girl was a cultivating genius, even his own son was inferior to her. He originally planned for them to nurture feelings for each other as they grew up, but in the end, it became a one-sided love on his son’s part.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were many people who fancied Di Chen in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, Lin Yuchen was one of them but when he tried to make a move on her, he was almost killed by her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, she left the Central Continent in order to avoid the son of the Sky Tyrant Lord and she somehow ended up in the Greencloud Continent, she only wanted to find a quiet and peaceful place. When she discovered that Lin Yuchen was the guardian of Sword Tower, she immediately entered the Heavenly Palace without hesitation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing was the young miss of Di Clan, thus she had been trying to establish a good relation with Di Chen and also came to the Greencloud Continent. Since Di Chen entered the Heavenly Palace, she could only enter Sword Tower, because aside from friends, enemies are the ones who will interact with each other the most.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only, she did not expect Lin Yuchen to die in Qing Shui’s hands, and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord would shield their own people at all cost. The Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord needed to use Qing Shui as an example to uphold their reputation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt uncomfortable standing there, this man caused him to feel afraid!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Martial Saint, a legendary existence in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young man, you should have thought of this day when you killed my disciple.” the Sky Tyrant Lord also had a personal agenda, Qing Shui not only killed his disciple, but most importantly, he heard that his daughter likes him, thus regardless of work or personal, he had to kill him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I only killed those who had to be killed, if the Sky Tyrant Lord wants to use his strength to suppress the weak, then go ahead.” Qing Shui had already formed his own opinions about him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young man, having a sharp mouth is useless, I have never cared about the words of weaklings, I only believe in strength.” the man looked at Qing Shui disdainfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he was in trouble today, He wanted to hide in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal but he did not want to do so before even exchanging blows. He had to see how far he was from a Martial Saint, Qing Shui was actually some what excited at being able to exchange blows with a Martial Saint.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His originally suppressed vigor circulated once again, raising it was to its peak in an instant, then he climbed onto the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he even stuck the Heavenly Talisman on himself once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But to that man it looked disdainful, he even looked at Qing Shui in distaste.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finished all these in an instant, then looked at the middle-aged man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young Man, on the account of your courage, make your move, or else you will not even have the chance to.” the man said empty-handed, exuding a domineering air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, don’t move, you will die!” Huang Qing shook her head at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you think that he won’t die if he doesn’t move?” The man casually said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Tian……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Girl, the words said by this Sky Tyrant Lord here have to be done, even if the Heavenly Emperor was here, I still have to do it!” the man released a strong pressure, causing the people around to retreat about 10 steps.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young man, make you move, I will not say this for a third time, treasure the chance you have before you regret it.” The man took a step towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With just this step, he caused an enormous pressure to descend on the earth, it felt like a dragon was rushing towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Roar!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Prrrrttt!!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under this enormous pressure, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant let loose a cry!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After sticking a few Heavenly Talismans onto the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Qing Shui stared at the Violet Gold Divine Shield!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Godly Armor Shield!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Able to defend against 50% of the opponent’s attack for 1 hour!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Defense doubles for 1 hour!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui felt much safer!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui used the Emperor's Qi, the man was clearly shocked. When Qing Shui’s released his pressure, his eyes brightened.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He needs to die!” the man immediately thought!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ming!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a clear bird cry from afar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man’s face changed, then he agilely climbed onto the big eagle and used one hand to send out a black cloud towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This speed was very fast, if one blinked, they would miss it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not care about anything else and struck with all his might using the Violet Gold Divine Shield, anticipating a repulsion effect and an increase of 20 percent to his attacking strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Bang……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An ear-splitting dull gong resounded, the surrounding mountains crumbled and the immediate surroundings had sand flying everywhere as though a huge sandstorm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A huge fissure the size of a mountain appeared when the two of them came into contact and in an instant, the area with 100 meters became hell, there was sand flying around as well as strong energy fluctuations.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With this first contact, Qing Shui knew that the distance between himself and that man was like heaven and earth, even with the Violet Gold Divine Shield dissipating 50 percent of the attack and the Seven Star Armored Vest doubling his defense and the Man Elephant Unison increasing his strength, it amounted to nothing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s body was like a kite with a broken string, he was in mid-air vomiting blood, his meridians were broken, his organs were ruptured and he felt like he was being drained off his blood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall Palace Mistress had rushed over to check out the situation, but instead, she saw Qing Shui body flying away…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Girl, he killed Chen`er!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He deserves to die!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress slowly moved towards the bloodied Qing Shui. She was dressed in snow white clothes and her shadow seemed lonely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel his life force disappearing quickly, he hurriedly took out a Five Dragon Pellet and swallowed it. The Five Dragon Pellet had another effect aside from curing poisons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Regardless of how heavy the damage, he would be able to withstand it for 24 hours.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for the Great Revitalizing Pellet, Qing Shui found that with his current heavy injuries, it would be useless. Qing Shui knew that the Great Revitalizing Pellet had not reached the level of reviving the dead.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a bitter smile on his face. He had believed that with all his strength, items and skills, her would be able to withstand at least one blow, if not, he would have the time to go into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, but in the end, the results caused Qing Shui to be stunned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How is this fellow so good? Since you are able to prolong your life by a day, I will let you have that day.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress looked at that middle-aged man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Those who kill people from my Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord must die!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What if I’m the one killing them?” The Sky Tyrant Lord stood in between Qing Shui and the man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“From today onwards, I’m never returning to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder sister!” Huang Qing called disappointedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have nothing to do with the Di Clan, no one from the Di clan is related to me.” the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord turned around to face the immobile Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This person who she had saved twice, was dying again because of her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It does not matter what the cause was or who was the killer, this was all because of her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Two clear drops of tears fell!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the first time she had cried was because of him, is it because he was going to die? From the first time she met him in the dream, to the point where she saw some hope in him, she had a special feeling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For him, are you going to disown your godfather? Xuan`er misses you……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tell him to give up. If you still want me to acknowledge you as godfather then go back and never come looking for me again.” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress said quietly, as she carried Qing Shui up, her white clothes quickly stained by Qing Shui’s blood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I’ll bring you back to the Heavenly Palace, you will be fine!” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress looked quietly looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her face was covered by a veil, her beautiful black pupils were wet, maybe because the dying Qing Shui, to her lonely self, might be her only friend.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There is no point, just put me down, let me see the heaven and earth of this mundane world!” Qing Shui said weakly, the effect of the Five Dragon Pellet had activated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s armed and ribs were all broken…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not satisfied, he still had not accomplished what he wanted to do yet…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of his mother in the Hundred Miles City, he was crying, in the final moments of his life, he could not see his mother, what would she do if she knew he was dead.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There is also Qing Qing, he had just returned to the Qing Clan, she had not interacted a lot with him. If he died, what would the Qing Clan do…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Liu-Li, Wenren Wu-shuang, Canghai Mingyue…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui looked that the absolute beauty carrying him, he took out a pair of earrings stained with his blood, it was the Silver Moon Wolf Earrings.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I still owe you a pair of earrings, all I can give you now is this!”</p>
