 <p><strong>AST 1108 - Full Out Massacre, The Rage of Beitang Yingji</strong></p>
 <p>The remaining ones gathered together quickly and released their own demonic beasts in the next moment. About 20 of them released close to a hundred demonic beasts of various sizes and colors.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui flicked his hand and called out his demonic beasts as well. If these people wished for a playground, he wouldn't mind giving them something worthwhile to play with.</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Demonic Spider, Thunderous Beast, Fire Bird and the rest appeared in an instant to greet the incoming demonic beasts. Qing Shui turned to the ladies and Little Fatty before relaying his instructions to them: “I will leave these demonic beasts to you all. Leave the humans to me. Be careful when you face them. Luan Luan, call out your demonic beasts and harness the bond between yourself and your beasts.”</p>
 <p>He hadn't expected that the opponents would call out such a huge number of demonic beasts to aid them. Each old man should possess four to five demonic beasts at most - a number that would scarcely deemed as ‘too much’. These demonic beasts would not possess power as high as ten thousand stars. Of course, there would be demonic beasts that exceeded that number - albeit only slightly. At the end of the day, the laws of heaven and earth would play a vital role and limit the powers of the stronger ones.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Luan Luan said contentedly and proceeded to summon all of her demonic beasts on the scene. Of course, those that were considered weak were not summoned. Yiye Jiange and the other ladies summoned their respective demonic beasts as well, before forming a formation together.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had thoughts about giving them intense training as he was en route to the battlefield. He wanted to make a demonstration earlier but decided that the ladies’ powers were a little bit weak to go against the likes of the Lion King’s Ridge. Because of that, he kept waiting for the right moment because he knew that a sect like the Lion King’s Ridge was known for taming demonic beasts and that they would certainly call upon the assistance of their demonic beasts to create a formation. Should that moment come, he would allow the ladies to make their moves as a way to test their strength in a real battle.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not take out the Soulshake Bell because his opponents weren’t worth his effort to use the invaluable artifact. He was confident that he would finish the deed soon enough if his opponents consisted of only a hundred or more demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>With the unleashing of the Nine Continents Mountain, a loud sound was heard. In an instant, a number of demonic beasts that were coming his way were split in two and died in the process. Qing Shui left his Six-Headed Demonic Spider and Thunderous Beast to aid the ladies with their formation after he had dealt with the opponents charging toward him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t plan on restraining his strength against these people, which was why he was fast and efficient as he went on a killing spree. His spiritual sense had also become increasingly powerful as he was able to sense the impressive spiritual power of his opponents surrounding him from afar. He knew they were the capable ones who were tasked to guard the Ancient Great Formation or at least those from the hidden sects and forces.</p>
 <p>And because of that reason, Qing Shui took some caution so that he would not expose his most powerful ability to his opponents. He wanted to attempt to put a slow death unto the Lion King’s Ridge without utilizing all of his power and that would include the Beitang Clan as well.</p>
 <p>Beitang Clan was the most influential and powerful existence in the Lion King’s Ridge. Incidentally, the clan head was also the lord of the Lion King’s Ridge. Qing Shui had already set his current goal to kill every last member of the Beitang Clan. But because the head clan of Beitang Clan was affiliated with the Lion King’s Ridge, he had no choice but to face opposition from the Lion King’s Ridge as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was well aware that the Lion King’s Ridge was an enormous sect. Even though the Beitang Clan was considered the voice of law, the second - and third - powerful forces were definitely in their grasp as well. Du Yannian was still in control of every movement the Beitang Clan made, essentially controlling their resources and forcing them to depend on him to the point that they were his slaves. This sort of situation sounded bleak yet was considered extremely dangerous to most people as Beitang Clan had the support of a higher power behind their backs.</p>
 <p>Lion King’s Roar!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the technique he had gotten from the Lion King’s Ridge at a terrifying level, through the use of his immensely powerful spiritual energy. The sound waves emitted by the technique were quite substantial and continued to push down against his opponents.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Whips, Dragon Transcends the Sky!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui casually flicked his right hand and conjured a grey colored flame python the thickness of an adult’s thigh that went straight toward the group of old men in front of him.</p>
 <p>And the leader of this group was none other than Beitang Demon!</p>
 <p>He was still alive after his position was switched by Qing Shui earlier!</p>
 <p>However, this time, Qing Shui would soon end his life. The Primordial Flame Dragon brought an immense pressure toward his opponents as it let out a resounding roar under the provision of his powerful spiritual energy. Beitang Demon looked on with fear as the fiery dragon approached fast, while the others remained still as if they had forgotten how to move as they watched Beitang Demon be devoured by the flaming dragon…</p>
 <p>These old men weren’t weak, per se but it was Qing Shui’s berserk power that caused them to lose their will to resist against him. If they were to continue using their formation to resist, they might be able to defend themselves for a bit longer. However, the disparity of their power was too great - it was as if a bunch of little children were trying to go against a burly adult…</p>
 <p>Total Annihilation!</p>
 <p>The humongous Primordial Flame Dragon swooped down toward the opposition force, blasting a path in an explosive manner. The damaging spiritual power of 100,000 stars was considered overkill for these men. Moreover, this was the first time that Qing Shui did not use the Buddha’s Eye Formation to maximize the potential of his spiritual power. In fact, he was able to unleash the spiritual power of more than 130,000 stars in the absence of such formation…...</p>
 <p>All the while the Primordial Flame Dragon was maneuvering explosively, the Nine Continents Mountain continued to strike down on his foes. Qing Shui’s spiritual energy consumption left about half or more capacity</p>
 <p>The ladies had also struck down a lot of enemies in a violent fashion quite comparable to Qing Shui’s. Even though they had managed to incapacitate the countless demonic beasts charging toward them, they weren't as calm as they could be when the fight first started. Fortunately, they were able to stabilize their composure once they had warmed up from their initial kills.</p>
 <p>None of their foes were left alive, not even the majority, whose members hailed from the Beitang Clan. Currently, Qing Shui stood at one side and observed the ladies warding off their opponents one by one.</p>
 <p>The Seven-Headed Crystal Beast was the strongest amongst the allied beasts. Not only did the beast gain a considerable amount of spiritual power after its seventh head emerged, it had also enhanced its physical defense to a terrifying level. Because of that, only the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast was capable of performing swift kills toward the opponents.</p>
 <p>Most of the ladies were wielding their Violet Jade Swords, with Little Fatty wielding his cudgel to defend himself. Lin Zhanhan was essentially surrounded in the middle by his allies without contributing to the fight. His powers were not enough to ward off the opposition forces. His demonic beast, the Shadow Demonic Panther, was excluded from the fight too. It was tasked to protect its master by staying close to him instead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched on as Luan Luan’s nimble figure shuffled from one demonic beast to another continuously while letting out weird noises. There were only a handful of her demonic beasts left on the field. She and her companion demonic beasts were essentially the power backbone as they continued to face dozens of enemies in front of them.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange and the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast were circling around the field, assisting those who needed their help…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he watched them killing the enemies’ demonic beasts in succession through teamwork. The ladies should experience this type of battle more often as their ability to grasp their talents was impeccable. Besides, they were already powerful in their own fields, thus they were able to control the situation without a hitch.</p>
 <p>The only problem lay within their lack of training. They might encounter some opportunity to do so in the future, but he realized that they had to be extra careful. People only have one life, after all. Qing Shui wouldn’t be able to cope with the truth should anything dreadful happened to them.</p>
 <p>It was until the moment that Wenren Wushuang cut down the last demonic beast that they realized Qing Shui was watching them. They flashed their smiles at him, relishing in happiness that they were able to share the battlefield with him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to the surroundings and observed quietly. He was shocked for a moment when he sensed a strong aura coming from one side, so he continued to observe before turning toward the other direction to sense any more danger.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go and rest. Tomorrow we will go to the Lion King’s Ridge!” Qing Shui didn’t plan to leave here so soon. He wanted to stay for at least another day.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>He led the ladies as they called back their demonic beasts toward the slope. The corpses of his opponents will be taken care of by their subordinates eventually. Some of them were already left as ashes on the ground. Even their Interspatial Silk Sachets were destroyed for the most part.</p>
 <p>The sachets that were still unharmed were looted away by Qing Shui and the ladies. They settled down in an inn not far from the brutal battlefield. The inn would not dare to turn them away even if the owner was affiliated with the Lion King’s Ridge.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Lion King Mountain, Lion King’s Ridge!</p>
 <p>Beitang Clan!</p>
 <p>“Big brother, Demon and the others have been killed!” Amongst the audience in a large living room, an old man exclaimed as he faced the elder one in the middle of the room.</p>
 <p>The elder one in the middle had a burly physique, yet not as exaggeratedly tall as most burly men were. Despite this, he would always give an impression as a towering man. That seemed to be an appropriate description for him as he was also the current head of the Beitang Clan, as well as the current lord of the Lion King’s Ridge - Beitang Yingji!</p>
 <p>He didn’t seem particularly old as his hair was mixed between white and black. He had a stern face and eyes as deadly as a vulture. Those eyes were overbearing and gloomy, which made many unable to tell what he was really thinking in his head.</p>
 <p>His robes were silver, yet different from the silver that many had donned on their clothing. This silver was deeper in color but brighter. The golden lion embroidered on his robes was even more dazzling and flashy.</p>
 <p>“His next target is the Lion King’s Ridge. If they manage to storm into the Lion King’s Ridge, then our Beitang Clan will lose all dignity to control everything.” Beitang Yingji said in a calm yet powerful tone.</p>
 <p>“Where did Yiye Clan find someone as powerful and as young as this guy? I feel like this matter is getting more difficult by the minute. We can’t allow the Yi Clan to take us as fools. They will always be in the second place, not the first.” Another old man walked up to them and spoke with anger. No one could tell if he was angry at Qing Shui or the Yi Clan.</p>
 <p>“If I’m correct, there will be fewer allies standing beside the Beitang Clan at this moment, especially for this matter. If the Beitang Clan is unable to solve this matter conclusively, then the end result will be severe. Even if there are members from the Supreme Elder Group who support Beitang Clan, there will be others who will side with Yi Clan or the other clans. In other words, we must eliminate this young man quickly. Only then will we be able to breathe easier.” Beitang Yingji lifted his head and spoke at the old men below him before surveying the others in the room.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, we still don’t know what terrifying treasure this kid could possibly have based on the reports. We didn’t think of him as a threat before. So now what? The young master and his men are now dead because of him.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t mention that fool ever again. If he wasn’t that soft-hearted back then, that brat wouldn’t be able to run away and we wouldn’t need to face such an ordeal at this time. This is the severe result of not pulling the roots of those we weeded. He will definitely annihilate our Beitang Clan and no one will be spared. Of course, he will destroy the Lion King’s Ridge too,” Beitang Yingji growled furiously.</p>
 <p>“My lord, that kid has no idea of the complexity of the situation. Our Beitang Clan is capable of destroying anyone regardless of who they are. I will kill him now,” said a scrawny old man with a flattering smile.</p>
 <p>“Beitang Guang, since you’ve volunteered yourself, then you shall have my order to destroy that kid. If you can’t bring back his head, then prepare to bring your own head to me. Now scram!” Beitang Yingji yelled after listening to Beitang Ying’s babbling.</p>
 <p>Beitang Guang left the living room with a pale face. When he initially announced that he would kill Qing Shui, he wasn’t really serious. He had been showing his loyalty by showering flatteries to Beitang Yingji but it seemed that he had gone too far with his flattery today.</p>
 <p>The Yin Clan!</p>
 <p>“Head clan, this is the best chance we’ve got. I wonder, how far that kid can torment the Beitang Clan?” A refined old man stood at the edge of a pond as he spoke to a lesser old man right next to him.</p>
 <p>“Mengyuan, what do you think? Is Qing Shui a genius or a fool?” The lesser old man turned to look at the refined old man beside him with a strained tone. Despite being younger than the refined old man, he was still finely aged, albeit slightly younger in appearance than his old companion.</p>
 <p>“For a man at such a young age to reach this kind of standard, I would naturally say he’s a genius. He’s a prodigy, even,” the lesser old man chuckled.</p>
 <p>“There we have it. Beitang Clan has brought malice upon themselves. We don’t need to do anything else. Only when the time is right, will we show ourselves and take control of everything into our hands.”</p>
