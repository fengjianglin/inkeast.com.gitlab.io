 <p><strong>AST 871 - A girl, Sacred Land: Lotus Realm, Acknowledging a Master</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a look at the Sky Penetrating Grass again. This thing was rather valuable to Qing Shui. If he had two stalks now he could try refining the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet. He only had one stalk now, thus he did not plan to refine either of them. 300 thousand kilometres, even 500 thousand or 1 million kilometres, Qing Shui would take the risk just to try to search for it.</p>
 <p>Suddenly Qing Shui felt that his heart was faintly in pain. This was a strange feeling. He had rarely felt this sensation. Perhaps it could be said that every since he got slightly more powerful, this situation stopped appearing.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>While Qing Shui was feeling slight pain in his heart, in a far place within the Greencloud continent, Huoyun Liuli had given birth to a girl. The little lass opened her eyes and saw her mother, then Huoyun Liuli saw that her daughter quickly fell asleep</p>
 <p>With a smile on her face, she too proceeded to sleep.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t any difference between a boy and a girl. The most important thing was that this was the child between her and Qing Shui. This child came quite late, which made Huoyun Liuli especially treasure her. It wasn’t to say that if she came earlier she wouldn’t treasure her, it was just that it was so difficult for her to come to this world...</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue, Qing Yi and Mingyue Gelou were all waiting here. When Huoyun Liu-Li started sleeping, the little lass had opened her eyes and looked bewilderedly at her surroundings. After crying a few times with all her might, she proceeded to immediately go to sleep.</p>
 <p>“To think that Liu-Li was worried that her child would be ugly. Look at that little lass’s tender and soft skin, it’s just like Liu-Lis, how beautiful.”said Canghai Mingyue as she looked towards Mingyue Gelou with a smile.</p>
 <p>“She’s just saying it. How could the child of her and Qing Shui be ugly.” replied Mingyue Gelou with a smile, as she looking at the little child happily.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Sacred Land: Lotus Realm!</p>
 <p>This was a dreamy and illusionary like world; it gave a feeling that everything was not truly real. There was a lot of water here. Furthermore, there was ample “Spiritual Qi” in the water. Dense and numerous huge lotus flowers filled the surface of the water.</p>
 <p>There were also many bamboo houses in the water. Between those houses were walkways made of bamboo. The houses constructed out of bamboo made it look refined and graceful, without a feeling of it being luxurious, however it gave a flavor of being detached from the mundane world.</p>
 <p>There were many mountains here, with lots of water and many bamboo forests. It could be considered as having mountains on one side and water on the other.</p>
 <p>Bamboo!</p>
 <p>The bamboo signified moral integrity. The people living here might have received the influence from the aura of the bamboo. A large majority of the people here exhibited the temperament of the bamboo. The Lotus Realm was a sacred place, and all the people here were unblemished women.</p>
 <p>At this time the lotus peak was full of people, and they were people of the Lotus Realm. There weren’t many people in the Lotus Realm, however each and every one of them were all elites. Most of them had rarely walked in the World of the Nine Continents, however many great families and powers all knew about the existence of this great power.</p>
 <p>At the top of the lotus peak stood an extremely eye-catchingly gigantic lotus platform. As white as snow and translucent like jade, it was not large, however silvery light twisted around its surface, while it radiated a mysterious energy.</p>
 <p>“Today’s the day our Lotus Realm holds the once-a-century owner recognition of the Lotus Platform. Any disciples whose strength has reached Martial Saint peak stage can participate. As long as the Lotus Platform recognizes any one of you as its owner, that person would become the next Lotus Realm leader.” said an old woman slowly, as she walked out with golden revolving crutch.</p>
 <p>She was the previous leader of the Lotus Realm, and had continued for 4 terms. Being the leader for four hundred years, it was time she retired and become an elder.</p>
 <p>“What if no one succeeds this time?” asked a youthful lady doubtfully.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to worry. The Lotus platform would choose the person that is most suitable to become the next leader of the Lotus Realm. Once it recognizes its owner, the benefits that come with it would be enormous. The inheritance of the Lotus would let you all become peak experts in a short time. This time it had accumulated for 3 hundred years. Okay, let’s begin. We’ll go according to the number given to you. Come up one by one, there’s no difference in being earlier or later. There’s no need to worry. As long as your compatible, even if you get the last number, it would still choose you.” replied the old woman before sweeping across all the people present with her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Number one!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Di Chen and her master stood at a place not far from here. Ever since she came here, Di Chen had been incomparably shocked. There were a lot of experts here. Currently she was already an early Martial Saint, however she was the most ordinary member here.</p>
 <p>The Lotus Realm was splitted into tens of branches.For example, aside from the branch where Di Chen’s master was in, there were 11 other similar ones. The Lotus Realm leader was the result of the competition between these 12 branches. The person who had created the Lotus Realm had set up this unchangeable rule for the sake of maintaining the strength of the Lotus Realm. Thus, the Lotus platform would choose the person with the best and most suitable talent for attaining the inheritance.</p>
 <p>Only through competitions would it be able to guarantee that every Lotus Realm leader would be the most outstanding. After so many years, many rules had changed, however this one had never changed at all. As the Lotus Realm was for unblemished women, if one was married, one had to leave the Lotus Realm.</p>
 <p>There were many women from the Lotus Realm that had married and gave birth. Although they were no longer people of the Lotus Realm, if the Lotus Realm were to have any problem , these people would not watch by the sidelines. Due to the fact that everyone from the Lotus Realm being beautiful women of the standard where only one could be found in a thousand miles, those who got married held great influence in the strong powers they married into, especially their men.</p>
 <p>A large majority of the women who stepped into the platform had flowery good looks, with exquisite and beautiful curves. However as one went up, one went down. The Lotus platform still did not have any reaction. This was a sacred land, and the Lotus platform only opens once every hundred years, therefore wanting to have a chance to try on normal occasions were naught.</p>
 <p>Everyone could only receive the Lotus inheritance once, and every Lotus inheritance would last at least a hundred years. Being able to absorb how much of it would depend on the aptitude of the person.</p>
 <p>“Number 121!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked at the sign in her hand. She had originally assumed that there would be people who would receive the inheritance very quickly. However now it was number 121 and there still wasn’t anyone that had successfully get the Lotus platform to recognize themselves as the owner.</p>
 <p>She was number 166,and it seemed to be the last number. She did not mind, however she got a feeling that this Lotus platform had a special kind of attractiveness to her.</p>
 <p>“Number 142!”</p>
 <p>The girl called out wore a white dress and had a cold and detached expression. When she stood on the Lotus platform, a faint white glow lighted up for not even a breath’s worth of time before dimming down.</p>
 <p>“Looks like the Lotus Realm leader this time would be obtained by the people of Chao Yang Xuan.”said a girl who seemed very unwilling.</p>
 <p>“Although senior sister Ding isn’t very special, she’s very strong. If she is able to receive the Lotus inheritance, We would no longer be able to catch up to her strength anymore.” said a woman with a shallow smile.</p>
 <p>“I hope that there would be a person more suitable than her!”</p>
 <p>“The people remaining are getting lesser and lesser. That’s hard!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>However this had already made many people turn feverish. After all, the people that had went up before did not even cause any reaction at all. After this girl walked down, the people behind continued the process.</p>
 <p>There was still not a slightest bit of reaction.</p>
 <p>“Number 158!”</p>
 <p>This time the woman who walked up looked to be slightly older. This was a curvy matured woman, her seductiveness having a distinct difference from the other women.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this woman who seductive and bewitching, many people had ugly expressions.</p>
 <p>“It’s said that she’s about to wed someone. What’s the point of coming here to become the Lotus Realm leader. What’s more if this vixen were to be selected, then the heavens are truly blind.”</p>
 <p>When the person had just said the blind word, the Lotus platform flashed with an every brighter glow, making the woman who had just spoke out cover her mouth.</p>
 <p>“Did I see wrongly!”</p>
 <p>“No, you saw correctly. Elder sister Mei is more suitable than senior sister Ding. This time it looks like you’ve hit a concrete wall. This eye piercing glow is stronger by many times compared to senior sister Ding’s.” said a seductive woman from another branch immediately, with thick despise in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Her word was akin to a slap to the woman who had spoken up previously.</p>
 <p>“Elder sister Mei is not only mature and beautiful, her talent is outstanding.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The voices of praise grew more and more, with people eager to let their voices be heard by the seductive woman.</p>
 <p>At a separate place within the place where few hundred ladies had gathered, a woman who had a look of contempt on her face and was similarly dressed seductively said, “These people are in fact more shameless than me. Once they saw that elder sister Mei was able to become the next leader, they started to say words of praises without restraint, while they won’t do such thing normally.”</p>
 <p>“They would scold us on a daily basis. Why would they talk good things about us?” said another woman with a mocking laugh.</p>
 <p>“Let them scold. In any case what we train in is dual cultivation. Even our ancestors had never forbid from not finding men. They’re just opinionated, and want to slander us.”</p>
 <p>“When elder sister Mei becomes the next Lotus Realm leader, she definitely has to beat them down.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Number 163!”</p>
 <p>“Number 164!”</p>
 <p>As of now many people basically had already determined that the next leader would be that seductive woman.</p>
 <p>“Number 166!”</p>
 <p>When Di Chen’s number was called, she nodded her head towards her master before walking to the Lotus platform. She felt that the Lotus platform seemed to be summoning her.</p>
 <p>“This is Martial Aunt Jiwu’s sole disciple. How beautiful!”upon seeing Di Chen walk out, a woman happily said.</p>
 <p>“You're right. There’re quite a number of beautiful ladies in our Lotus Realm, however I’ve always felt that she’s the most beautiful.”added a woman with long bangs enviously.</p>
 <p>“Now I wish that she become the next leader of our Lotus Realm.”said a woman who was slightly older than the rest.</p>
 <p>“Being beautiful doesn’t equate to being suitable. However I also hope so, as I feel that anyone would be better than that seductress.”</p>
 <p>Soon this place was filled with lively discussions, as these people were clearly not at peace with that seductive woman.</p>
 <p>Di Chen did not walk fast, however the transcendent aura she radiated gave an indescribable feeling to the surrounding people. It wasn’t envy, as it had already exceeded their boundaries from envy. There was some envy, however, jealousy was not worth mentioning…</p>
 <p>Many old people of the older generation and even the previous Lotus Realm Leader stared at Di Chen with with interest in their eyes: “Such a good Goddess Jade Bone Structure.”</p>
 <p>Di Chen slowly walked up the Lotus Platform . There wasn’t the slightest reaction. She was the last person, and unexpectedly there were at least 80% of the people below that hoped that this beautiful woman would become the next Lotus Realm leader.</p>
 <p>After a breath’s worth of time, the Lotus Platform still had no reaction. The people below were very quiet, with many people holding in their anticipation.Seeing that there was no reaction, Di Chen turned around and walked down.</p>
 <p>Even the previous Lotus Realm leader could not resist and sighed, as if she felt exceptional depressed.</p>
 <p>Just as Di Chen had already taken a step of the Lotus platform, the platform suddenly started to fill with silvery light. A bright and eye piercing glow immediately enveloped Di Chen within it…</p>
