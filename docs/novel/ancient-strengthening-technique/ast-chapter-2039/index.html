 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the fight on the day after tomorrow, the Liu Clan would definitely test him by sending assassins to kill him. If they got the chance to do so, they would definitely not think twice to do it. Even if they were unable to kill him, the assassination could help them estimate his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui remembered Little Rin and the most important Dragon Spider. The current Dragon Spider was very fearsome. Actually, only the Dragon Slaying Beast and Qing Shui were required to take care of it. But for security purposes, it was also a sensible choice to leave LIttle Rin outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Out of the three matches, two must be won. He might as well let Yu Xixuan take part in the battle. The Dragon Spider, Thunderous Beast, and Ice Burst Demonic Bear together wouldn’t have any problems to take down one win. The current Dragon Spider was formidable. It might even be better than Little Rin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief. He smiled and looked at Yu Xixuan. “Xixuan, I will count you in for the match.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph? Am I strong enough for it?” Yu Xixuan looked at Qing Shui and said in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By then, take two of my demonic beasts along and you should be fine.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dinghe didn’t say anything about it. With things having reached this stage, he was no longer able to see through this man. He felt that this young man had kept the best plan for himself. For now, the current Yu Clan was nothing. He then looked at Qing Shui and thought for a while, “For the final representative, why don’t you leave it to me?” said Yu Dinghe suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dinghe’s strength was only decent, and this was a fight where one was responsible for their own life. Qing Shui didn’t want anything to happen, thus, he responded after a moment of thought, “If I’m not mistaken, the strength of Clan’s Head Yu should be slightly more powerful than uncle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true, but the Yu Clan can’t survive without big brother. Mister Qing, will anything happen to Xixuan?” Yu Dinghe asked in concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle, rest assured. Nothing will happen to Xixuan. She won’t need to do anything. With the demonic beasts around, she would have been able to defeat the opponent.” Qing Shui said with a firm voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave the place of the last representative to me!” A loud and clear, but yet old voice came through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Yu Dinghe and Yu Xixuan stood up in shock as they glanced at the old man who was walking towards the entrance. Yu Xixuan happily ran towards the old man and embraced him with both of her arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, let me introduce you to my grandpa. My grandpa has been the closest to me in my entire clan.” Yu Xixuan said in joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, little brat. At least make sure that I am not around when you are saying things like this.” Yu Dinghe looked at Yu Xixuan with a pampered look and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heihei, it doesn’t matter if you are here or not. This is the truth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice to meet you, gramps!” Qing Shui quickly stood up and greeted the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s back was a bit hunched. He was dressed in a white gown and looked unusually normal. However, a powerful energy could be felt flowing across his body. Qing Shui smiled as soon as he saw him, “With you here, we will have already accumulated enough strength for the battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected for there to be such a powerful warrior in the Yu Clan. However, the only sad thing was the elderly man’s life force. It was almost depleted. Basically, he might only have a few days left. If not mistaken, he could at most live for another half a year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, you are the most outstanding person I have ever seen. I am very happy to see my girl, Little Xuan with you. Unfortunately, this is as far as the Yu Clan can be.” The old man sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa, don’t worry about it. Yu Clan will get even better.” Yu Xixuan was very happy to be beside the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Out of the entire Yu Clan, the person whom I have the highest hope for is your father. Unfortunately, he has a weak mind and couldn’t dedicate himself to look after our Yu Clan. Your oldest uncle, on the other hand, cares too much about reputation and money. Forget it, let’s stop talking about this.” The old man shook his head. He no longer had the time, nor was he able to get involved in matters like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, your medical skills are splendid. Since you were even able to cure Old Man Qiao of the Liu Clan, can you see through my situation?” The old man smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really want me to say it?” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Say it, there is nothing to hide.” The old man was very honest with his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, your hidden illness is no longer controllable. Half a year at most.” Qing Shui said after a moment of thought. He knew that the old man was aware of what he was trying to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed it’s as the rumor says. With your medical skills alone, you are already able to establish a place for yourself in the World of the Nine Continents. You are still young, An outstanding tree will often get destroyed by the forests’ wind. You must learn to protect yourself. A lot of people in this world are born evil. They don’t like seeing others more capable than themselves.” The old man looked at Qing Shui and said with a serious voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui naturally knew about this principle. He nodded, “Thank you old man for your concern.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know that you have got your own plans. However, you must watch out for these few days. This includes you too, Little Lass Xuan.” The old man relaxed his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that his assumptions before were all correct. Liu Clan would definitely do something to him before the battle. At the very least, they would want to test how strong he was. As the saying went ‘Know yourself, but also know your enemies’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, when the battle has ended, please allow me to help you cure your hidden illness.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui mentioned some of the situations of the old man, Yu Dinghe didn’t feel weirded out by it. A depressed look flashed across Yu Xixuan’s eyes. She seemed to know about it, but back then, she decided not to talk about it. From here, it would seem that they were all aware that the old man’s situation was incurable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, now that she heard Qing Shui saying that he was able to cure him, Yu Xixuan’s expression changed and looked at Qing Shui in amazement. Even though she was already aware that Qing Shui’s medical skills were very powerful, she never expected for it to be powerful to this extent. She said in surprise, “Are you really able to cure my grandpa’s hidden illness?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I can. I have told you before that my medical skills are very formidable.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know my own condition well. But young man, I still have to thank you for your effort.” The old man slightly shook his head.</span></p>

The Dragon Slaying Beast and Dragon Spider were outside. When the Dragon Spider was in its human form, it had the look of a very beautiful teenage girl.

One wouldn’t be able to detect them by merely trying to see them with naked eyes. Ever since Qing Shui’s Spiritual Sense went through some mutated changes, he was able to easily see the assassins with his Spiritual Sense. Qing Shui revealed a smile on his face and as soon as he moved, his entire figure disappeared from the spot he was standing on.</span></p>
