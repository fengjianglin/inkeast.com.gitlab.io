 <p><strong>AST 1171 - Dark Current, Taking the Heavenly Secrets Pill, Forging the Big Dipper Sword</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui would never have thought that she had such an identity—Demon Lord. It was an existence which seemed to be very distant from him but yet appeared right before his eyes. Moreover, they had once gotten very close skinship, albeit it a wrong one.</p>
 <p>She wasn't from Western Oxhe Continent. Then she was from one of the other three continents? Was it Soaring Dragon Continent, Dancing Phoenix Continent or the Haohan Continent?</p>
 <p>Earlier, he had summoned his courage to speak up and knew that he had no hope. In her eyes, he was as insignificant as an ant. However, back when they were in the five continents, she didn't kill him. This showed that she wasn't one who would kill the innocent.</p>
 <p>Humans would not be together with ants. In this vast and dangerous world, Qing Shui could clearly understand this feeling. She had a very high status and her world wasn't one which he could come into contact with or withstand at the moment. Therefore, she had said that they didn't belong in the same world and it would be impossible for their paths to cross.</p>
 <p>He also recalled the old turtle's sigh back at the crystal palace. It could be because it had already expected this conclusion back then and even had treated Qing Shui as a sacrifice to save the lady in the crystal coffin.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui didn't hate the old turtle. Dangers and opportunities go hand in hand and it was also from that encounter that his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had leveled up and his abilities had soared. Therefore, all in all, he hadn't lost anything. On the contrary, it could be said that he had gained a lot from that encounter.</p>
 <p>He felt that he was softhearted. It could be because he was a more emotional person, because they'd had sex or because he had wanted to use his heart to melt her cold expressions...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had even thought of being a pillar of support for her. It was a pity that he wasn't capable of that currently. All in all, it still boiled down to his cultivation. She was the owner of the Palace, she was the Demon Lord. What kind of cultivation would he need to be able to reach her level? How long would it take?</p>
 <p>Right now, she as well as Demon Lord Palace's level shouldn't be lower than that of a Grade Four Dynasty. This was still considered a conservative estimation!</p>
 <p>How terrifying was that level? Qing Shui rubbed his head, not wanting to think anymore. It was useless to think too much into it. Right now, it was more important for him to make good use of time to work hard in his cultivation!</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to look at Yan Jinyu and saw the worry in her eyes. He smiled and shook his head, "It's nothing. We've met once and it seems that I don't know as much about her as you do."</p>
 <p>"Alright, Qing Shui, I don't know what happened between the two of you. But at least for these few years, there's nothing you can do. Listen to me, be down-to-earth in your training and there might be a chance in the future. Sister trusts that you're capable of it," Yan Jinyu smiled and said. She was very clever and although she didn't know what had happened between them, at least she felt that Qing Shui cared a lot about that lady.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. Thank you for consoling me, Sister!" Qing Shui shook his head and smiled. However, he did feel happy to hear what Yan Jinyu had said. At least, this lady truly meant well for him and the things she said were very pleasant and effective. It was exactly what he had thought.</p>
 <p>"Let's go. We'll find an inn to stay at and then hurry on our way back tomorrow. Sister will treat you to some wine but you'll have to be the one to bring out the wine..." Yan Jinyu broke into a laugh.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't interested in checking out the place and thus Yan Jinyu lost interest in doing so either. When Qing Shui went to meet that lady earlier, he had already thrown away his bamboo hat and thus he decided not to wear it anymore.</p>
 <p>Yang Clan Inn!</p>
 <p>This was considered quite a high quality inn, at least by appearance. Qing Shui thought of how the area was called Yang City, so the Yang Clan Inn must come from a strong background.</p>
 <p>"Yang Clan is the strongest clan in this area and Yang Clan Inn is one of the businesses under them. This was not the only one. There were quite a number of Yang Clan Inns in the area and all of them belonged to Yang Clan,” Yan Jinyu smiled and said as she entered with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Practically all aristocratic clans would have their own high quality inns. This was because one would be able to get news the fastest in such places. With many people and loose tongues gossiping around, they would be able to get a lot of information.</p>
 <p>The inn took up a very large space. Based on the standards from Qing Shui's previous life, it wouldn't be considered an inn anymore. It was far too big. There was the main hall and private rooms. It had a length of 1,000 meters and a width of several hundred meters. The traffic before the entrance was high and the fragrances of the wine and food which flooded out were quite tempting.</p>
 <p>A waitress went up to greet them the moment they had entered. Qing Shui and Yan Jinyu were there to stay and to have their meals. They got their meals sent right to their room. The room they got was on the highest story and it was very costly. However, Qing Shui had no financial worries at the moment.</p>
 <p>The room was very spacious and there were two bedrooms and one hall. The room was designed with two stories, with the bedrooms on the higher story and the hall on the lower. Every level of this inn was very high, so there was no problem with designing two stories for each room.</p>
 <p>It didn't take the waitress long to serve their food. Qing Shui and Yan Jinyu ate in the hall and although the food didn't taste as good as if they were to cook with their own spices, it would get pretty boring if one had to eat the same thing often. It was just like if a person were to eat meat often, they would find vegetables tasty when they ate them occasionally.</p>
 <p>Halfway through their meals, the sound of door knocks rang out. Seeing that Yan Jinyu was also stunned, Qing Shui stood up and said smiling, "It might be the waiters from the inn!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened the door to find a handsome guy. He appeared to be slightly younger than middle-age and from his dress, it was clear that he wasn't one of the waiters in the inn.</p>
 <p>"You are?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>"Is Miss Jinyu here?" the man smiled and asked but didn't answer Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could even tell that there was a hint of disdain and arrogance in the guy's eyes toward him. Qing Shui shook his head. He didn't care about these things but still asked again, "Who are you?"</p>
 <p>"I'm Yang Yicun [1]!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui almost burst out laughing. He had heard of Yang Dingtian and Qiu Qianchi [2] but he hadn't expected this person's name to be Yang Yicun. It was probably from the saying 'an inch of time is worth an inch of gold [3]' or served as a reminder for him to constantly take each second preciously. However, the impact it created when paired with this surname was just too hilarious.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, who is that?" Yan Jinyu's voice rang out.</p>
 <p>"Oh, he said that he's called Yang Yicun..."</p>
 <p>By then, Yan Jinyu had already walked up next to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Miss Jinyu, I heard from my subordinates that you'd come. Why didn't you tell me in advance?" When Yang Yicun saw Yan Jinyu, he smiled and said.</p>
 <p>After saying that, he clapped his hands and several waitresses walked out, holding dishes filled with steaming hot delicacies.</p>
 <p>"Young Master Yang, we've already eaten. There's no need for these." Yan Jinyu shook her head and stopped the waitresses who were about to enter.</p>
 <p>"Oh, is that so? Then you guys can head back!" Yang Yicun waved his hand casually and said.</p>
 <p>"We're only passing by and will be leaving very soon. Therefore, we won't be troubling Young Master Yang," Yan Jinyu said in a polite tone.</p>
 <p>"It's a rare opportunity that Miss Jinyu has come to Yang City. Why not let me bring you to have a look around the area in the afternoon? Otherwise, if Yan City's city lord were to know that I've been a poor host, he'll definitely blame me." From the beginning to the end, Yan Jinyu didn't even take a look in Qing Shui's direction.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this man didn't think much of him. Could it be that it was because he didn't let him enter earlier?</p>
 <p>"Maybe next time. I'm tired and would like to rest for today," Yan Jinyu said calmly.</p>
 <p>"If that's the case, then Miss Jinyu, please rest well. I'll come visit at a later time!" With that, he smiled and nodded and then turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yang Yicun's departing figure and felt a little strange. It was because he had seen Yang Yicun's weird gaze when he had turned to leave. Qing Shui turned toward Yan Jinyu, "Sister, in the future, you must be on your guard around this person."</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I know. He looks egotistical, ignorant and arrogant but these are just the facade he puts up. He's trying to hide something." Yan Jinyu smiled.</p>
 <p>"Oh, so Sister knows about it!"</p>
 <p>"Yang Clan is a restless bunch. He wishes to gain control of the outer city. When that happens, he'll be able to enter the inner city and wait for a chance to strike."</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui knew that Yan Jinyu was already on her guard around this person, it was enough. Closing the room's door, they continued with the meal they were still in the middle of earlier.</p>
 <p>Since there were no plans for the afternoon, Qing Shui headed upstairs, preparing to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu went up as well. There were two bedrooms on the upper story, but they were a distance away from each other. There was also a small living room there which separated the bedrooms. The bedrooms were not side-by-side.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out a demonic beast to be on guard. Right now, there were not many people who could be of a threat to Yan Jinyu. Qing Shui told her not to go out and if she were to go out, for her to call him along.</p>
 <p>Upon entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui couldn't wait but took out a Heavenly Secrets Pill and ate it. The Heavenly Secrets Pill was snow white and translucent. It was the size of one's thumb and upon consumption, it gave of a fragrant and refreshing feeling. Very soon, a warm feeling rose and rapidly flowed through his entire body. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable feeling.</p>
 <p>He had initially thought that he would need to go through a period of torment, however, it turned out to be quite enjoyable. Very quickly, a powerful energy rose within him and his physical strength increased by one nimbus.</p>
 <p>This medicinal pill was very gentle but its effect was tremendous. The area of alchemy was very powerful but it was a pity that Qing Shui lacked alchemy recipes and medicinal herbs. Moreover, his own medicine seemed to be for his consumption as his cultivation grew and was especially suited for himself. Most importantly, the medicinal herbs were hard to come by.</p>
 <p>It was just like how the alchemy recipe for this Heavenly Secrets Pill should be very precious as well and the medicinal herbs would definitely not be ordinary. However, if he were given both the alchemy recipe and the medicinal herbs, Qing Shui had confidence that he would be able to refine them.</p>
 <p>With an additional one nimbus of strength increase to his physical strength, Qing Shui now had a strength of 11 nimbus. The prowess of his Nine Continents Mountain was now getting close to the lowest grade State Masters and his spirit energy had also gone through some changes. However, right now, Qing Shui felt that there was a need for him to reforge his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Since it was already decided, Qing Shui put it into action. Every little increase to his strength was something. Although everything around them seemed very peaceful, there seemed to be a dark current that was coming soon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first melted the Greencloud Stone and that useless Greencloud Sword, both given by Yan Jinyu, with his primordial flames. He then worked on the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Right now, just by using his Hexa-color Rainbow Art of Forging, Qing Shui would also be able to increase the prowess of the Big Dipper Sword. However, he wanted to add in the Greencloud Stone since it could increase his spirit energy. Right now, the Big Dipper Sword no longer provided an increase to his spirit energy.</p>
 <p>The Greencloud Stone could increase one's spirit energy. There was also the Five-Colored Stone and other materials in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal which he could add in, including Golden Extract Essence, Violet Jade and Thunder Rock!</p>
 <p>After completing his preparations, Qing Shui went into full concentration for the forging of his Big Dipper Sword. With the experience he had from previous tries, this time around, he was relatively familiar with the process. There wasn't much Greencloud Stone left to begin with but with that smelted Greencloud Sword, it was just enough.</p>
 <p>However, during the forging process this time around, Qing Shui felt something strange with the Big Dipper Sword. It was because despite having so much Greencloud Stone added to the Big Dipper Sword, it didn't go through any changes. It was like a black hole.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui felt that in the end there was only the feeling that it was saturated. He then added the Golden Extract Essence, 10,000 Years Coldsteel, Violet Jade and Thunder Rock, before he started the hammering and tempering process. This was a crucial process to forging arts, to bring out the impurities and let the remaining essence completely merge together and form a smooth flow.</p>

 <p>[2] Yang Dingtian: The characters for Dingtian means holding up the heavens and can be inferred to as being upright. Qiu Qianchi: The words from Qianchi represents 1,000 feet. Qiu, although a different character, sounds the same as the qiu representing beg.</p>
