 <p><strong>AST 588 - Diamond Crossing Rivers and Vajra’s Glare The Martial Saint warriors from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord arrives!</strong></p>
 <p>What Qing Shui was truly worried about was whether the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord would intrude upon the Qing Clan when he was away. At present, if the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was to stand guard for Qing Clan, the Qing Clan would be already considered to have built an impregnable wall for themselves. As long as there was only one Fourth grade Martial Saint warrior and the rest who came were below third Martial Saint grades, Qing Shui wouldn't be too worried about it.</p>
 <p>He still had six months left. Within these six months, he might be able to help significantly increase the strength of the people in Qing Clan, especially Luan Luan and her Demonic Beasts. In ten years time, that little brat could end up as one of the most powerful existences.</p>
 <p>After the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection reached Great Perfection Stage, two new abilities showed up in the Elephant Form. Furthermore, it was also the two which Qing Shui was really familiar with. Diamond Crossing Rivers and Vajra’s Glare</p>
 <p>The Diamond Crossing Rivers was still an active skill at the moment. Since it hadn't even reached the Small Success Stage, it could only help raise a very small amount of speed.</p>
 <p>Vajra’s Glare too was an active battle skill. It focused all of the strength throughout one’s body on the eyes and shot it towards the opponents in a unique way. There was quite a high chance it would distract the opponent. The stronger the target was, the lower the chances of success..</p>
 <p>Luckily, Qing Shui was still quite satisfied with these two battle skills. He planned to practice them a bit harder in the future. He hoped that the Diamond Crossing River would turn out to be like Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection which could permanently increase its physical speed.</p>
 <p>As for the Vajra’s Glare, Qing Shui felt that this battle skill would consume quite a lot of spirit energy. He felt that it would be really tough to train this, but once it succeeded, it would definitely be a fatal attack to his opponents.</p>
 <p>For the past one year, Qing Shui had also accomplished one more thing. He successfully drew the &lt;&lt;<span>Hundred Forms of the Tiger&gt;&gt;</span> . As of now, his skill in drawing skin had reached the Great Perfection Stage. Occasionally, he was even able to reach the level of drawing ‘flesh and blood’.</p>
 <p>An increase in realm also meant an increase in quality. When Qing Shui looked at the tiger drawing which had attained the level of drawing “flesh and blood”, he felt like he was looking at an actual living tiger standing right in front of him.</p>
 <p>For a tiger drawing at the level of “drawing skin” on the other hand, even if it attained the peak level of “drawing skin”, it would still only give people the feeling of seeing a drawing no matter how beautiful or realistic it looked.</p>
 <p>This was the difference between the level of “drawing skin” and “drawing flesh and blood”. Only when one attained the level of drawing “flesh and blood” would they be able to draw a tiger which looked like it had flesh and blood. Even for Qing Shui, he was only able to attain this kind of level occasionally.</p>
 <p>The levels in drawings were divided into six categories. They were the level of introduction, the level of drawing skin, the level of drawing flesh and blood, the level of drawing bones, the level of drawing souls and level of drawing divine essences.</p>
 <p>Six levels, and it got harder and harder as one progressed through each level. As for Qing Shui, he hoped that he would be able to master the level of “drawing flesh and blood” within these six months.</p>
 <p>Out of the hundred forms of tiger pictures, Qing Shui had only managed to draw out 23 of them. As he progressed, he found it harder and harder to draw them. The godly might and presence of the tigers weren’t something which Qing Shui could draw with his current ability.</p>
 <p>Despite that, his efforts didn’t totally go to waste. As of now, the Qing Shui could draw out 40% of the strength from the Heavenly Talismans which he drew. On top of that, the strength and accuracy of the Heavenly Talismans had also been increased significantly. The Heavenly Talismans which he drew felt really lively. Especially the pictures on them. , they all seemed as if were extremely life-like. For warriors at the same level as him, they wouldn't be able to evade it even if they were able to see it.</p>
 <p>This was also why Qing Shui decided to dedicate himself more into drawing in the future. He hoped to at least improve his skills up to the level of “drawing bones”. As for the levels beyond that, it wasn’t that Qing Shui didn't want it, it was just too difficult for him to achieve it. Beyond the level of drawing “bones”, one didn't only need to be dedicated, they would also need to have talent to do so.</p>
 <p>There was still one more thing that he improved a lot in, it was the Hidden Weapons. Throughout this one year, Qing Shui had put many times more effort into it than before.</p>
 <p>It was just like the last time when the elderly man threatened Qing Shui with Luan Luan and Yu Chang. With his current strength in Hidden Weapons, he might not necessarily have been able to keep the two safe and sound. However, it turned out that his Hidden Weapons were still able to threaten the elderly man’s life. The old man was put in a situation where it was either he evade them by letting go of the brats or he die with them.</p>
 <p>Life was really precious. Qing Shui almost sure that he would choose to let go of the two little brats and escape under those kind of circumstances. If he had trained his Hidden Weapons back then, he wouldn’t have had to face such a risky situation.</p>
 <p>Within this one year, Qing Shui managed to make a huge change to his fighting style and his strength. Especially the Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection which reached the Great Perfection State.</p>
 <p>The stronger he became, the more he felt that the “Emperor’s Qi” was heaven defying. Other than the Critical Damage, Qing Shui still had one more fatal weapon up his sleeve. It was the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb. Throughout this one year, Qing Shui had also refined it numerous times. Even though he wasn't clear about just how strong it currently was, he could still feel that the fluctuating aura exuded from it being a lot more terrifying than before.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Daddy, today is my birthday! Have you prepared anything for me?” Luan Luan attached herself to Qing Shui’s arm and asked.</p>
 <p>Throughout this one year, this little brat once again went through another growth spurt. Even though she was already fifteen and about the same height as the women around Qing Shui, she still hadn’t gotten rid of her childish nature. One notable point was that she looked really identical to Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Crimson Dragon Bow which had been neglected for a long time and a lot of bone arrows which he just forged not so long ago. They were all made of beast bones at the Martial King grade. There were also a few which were made of Martial Saint grade beast bones.</p>
 <p>“Since you are a Beast Tamer, I’ll just give you this. You can practice your shooting skills at the back whenever you are free.” Qing Shui smiled as he handed them over to Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>As soon as they reached her hands, Luan Luan joyfully hugged Qing Shui, “Daddy is the best! You don’t even mind giving me good things like these! And here I thought daddy are going to leave them for Zun`Er and Yin`Er。“</p>
 <p>After finishing talking, the sly Luan Luan winked at Qing Shui with her clear pupils. In response to that, Qing Shui extended his hand and pinched her nose: “You are my daughter. Deep in my heart, you are just the same as them, it’s so saddening to hear you say that.”</p>
 <p>“Wu, wu, I’m a big girl now! Don’tt pinch my nose! I’m just joking around with you daddy, I know daddy is the best to me.” Luan Luan broke free from Qing Shui as she tried to comfort Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You mischievous brat, alright! You go cultivate properly! You know that you will turn out to be the strongest person in our clan.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Yiye Jiange came in with some food. Qing Shui didn’t actually let everyone attend the girl’s birthday. He only wanted to celebrate it with Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Throughout all these years, this was how Qing Shui celebrated their birthday in the clan. He also did the same thing with Yu Chang’s.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange’s face would be filled with a satisfied smile whenever she saw Qing Shui and Luan Luan getting along with each other.</p>
 <p>“Mother, the food that you prepare nowadays is really good.” Ever since she was small, Luan Luan had always been a quick-witted kid. Until now, she was still really good at saying nice things.</p>
 <p>“It won’t make any difference no matter how much you compliment my cooking. The present I gave you will still stay the same.” Yiye Jiange smiled at Luan Luan. After that, she glanced towards Qing Shui before asking them to eat.</p>
 <p>The meal lasted all the way until nighttime. The night market outside had long since started. The lights from the moon and other sources outside sprinkled into their room. By then, the three had long since finished their dinner and were sitting in the room gossiping with each other.</p>
 <p>Not long after, Luan Luan went back to where she lived. She resided in a small pavilion which was not far away from there, leaving only Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange in the room.</p>
 <p>“Unknowingly, it has already been twelve years since I first saw Luan Luan.” Qing Shui softly mumbled to himself. He looked like he was reminiscing the past.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, we have already known each other for more than ten years.” Yiye Jiange smiled and responded. After finishing speaking, she was also startled to see that Qing Shui looked a lot more mature than before.</p>
 <p>“Has Luan Luan asked you about those things yet?”</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>“Hmm, you’re sure she doesn’t have the slightest clue about her origin? Do you plan to tell her in the future?” As Qing Shui noticed, Luan Luan was slowly getting older and older, he felt a bit clueless on what to do about some things.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know, do you think we should tell her?” Yiye Jiange asked Qing Shui back the same question.</p>
 <p>“If we really want Luan Luan to return to her own family, naturally we would need to tell her. If we only want Luan Luan to be happy, I don’t think there is a need to do so. This would traumatize her.” Qing Shui didn’t explain clearly what he meant. Despite that, he felt that Yiye Jiange who was sitting opposite him could clearly understand his meaning because she also knew how it felt to be lonely.</p>
 <p>“If Martial Brother is still alive, he would also hope for that little brat to live her life happily. As for returning to her clan, these are all not important. If you don’t mind, Luan Luan can forever be your daughter.” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui,</p>
 <p>“She is always my daughter. Even if she was to return to her clan in the future, I will continue to see her as my own.” Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>“The luckiest thing that happened to Luan Luan was meeting you.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The day went on really peacefully. Qing Shui knew that he was going to leave sooner or later, hence he left all of his other time to his clan members. Even more so for the two little children.</p>
 <p>After two months, there were once again people coming up to the Qing Clan. There were around ten of them. Each and every one of them were old men around their sixties with brows and hair white as snow. The flying beast which they rode was a Three-headed Bird.</p>
 <p>When he felt the tremendous aura, he knew that the people he had been anticipating had finally shown up. On the contrary of what one might think, instead of feeling nervous, he was really happy. After all, Qing Shui felt that it was about time he settled everything regarding the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p>He raised up his head and looked at the ten enormous Three-headed Birds. Each and every one of them was around thirty meters big. The head of a bird, neck of a snake and beautiful tri-color feathers, The Three-headed Birds looked really ruthless and fierce. They had two thick and sharp claws and a pair of strong wings.</p>
 <p>Ten Three-headed bird, flying in the air and covering the sky, even the sun was covered by them!</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Lin, you and Grandpa Luo should take the others and move away from this place.” Qing Shui informed Lin Zhanhan. He looked really serious when he said it because he was aware that this time, the Residence Sky Tyrant Lord came with the intention to settle things once and for all.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stepped up the air like he was stepping on stone stairs as he rose up into the sky. Frankly speaking, Qing Shui was also trying to delay the time as long as possible. That was why he patiently walked while measuring the strength of the ten old men who were waiting in the air.</p>
 <p>The person taking the lead was a tall, sturdy and powerful old man. He was about half a head taller than the other old men present. Just from the look and the head of the old man, Qing Shui could already tell that he was the senior of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p>The pressure that was released by ten Martial Saints was considerably heavy. Despite that, Qing Shui’s Nature Energy didn’t fear it in the least. Step by step, Qing Shui walked up to them. Simultaneously, he himself also found it hard to believe that he was actually doing that.</p>
 <p>The Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord was the weakest clan out of the Seven Stars. Even though that was the case, it could still easily bring out around ten Martial Saints at once.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could tell very clearly that the other nine elderly men at the back were weaker than the one at the most front. Nevertheless, Qing Shui was still quite impressed. He was aware that the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord had a Fourth grade Martial Saint warrior, but he never thought that there could easily be six of them behind the elderly man at the front.</p>
 <p>“Erm, may I know if you have any business with Qing Clan?” Qing Shui only stopped when he was almost at the same level as them.</p>
 <p>“To think that there would be such a monstrous person in Green Cloud Continent, it does make people feel really surprised. Qing Shui, let’s settle all the scores today. Oh, and, I’m someone from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. You should more or less know why we’re here?” The huge and powerful old man who took the lead spoke with a low muffled voice.</p>
 <p>“Oh, Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, if you hadn’t mentioned it, I think I would have totally forgotten about you guys. I originally thought that you guys would come earlier.” Qing Shui smiled at the old man.</p>
 <p>Looking as the young man in front was capable of maintaining a calm mind despite standing right in front of them, they all frowned. Logically, for someone capable of crippling Tian`Er, he would more or less have the strength of a peak Second grade Martial Saint. But even if he had been a Third grade Martial Saint, he shouldn’t be able to face them so calmly.</p>
 <p>“You crippled my grandson… This incident has made the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord lose their face. Today, I came in hope that we can settle everything by reaching a mutual agreement. How do you feel about this?” It seemed like the old man wasn’t really affected by the fact that the Sky Tyrant Lord was crippled. All he cared about was the reputation of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p>“Solving it with a mutual agreement? Well why not, that’s what I was thinking too. So what kind of mutual agreement do you want?” Qing Shui asked the old man. The smile on his face turned even brighter.</p>
 <p>“Your first option would be to first recover the strength of the people that you’ve hurt and swear your loyalty to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord after that.” The old man said casually with his sight set on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Then what’s the second option?” Qing Shui asked while maintaining the same expression.</p>
 <p>“You finish it yourself. Or you can also let us take your place to do it. But by doing it that way, we might accidentally injure the people from your clan.” The old man explained while keeping a calm expression.</p>
 <p>“I’ll go with the third one!”</p>
 <p>“There isn’t a third option.” The old man looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“If I were to trap all of you here, will the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord be removed from the Seven Stars list?” Qing Shui looked at the old man seriously. The smiling expression on his face also disappeared.</p>
 <p>They indeed were a family. Not only was the Sky Tyrant Lord like that, the old bastard who showed up now was just the same! It was a miracle that these kinds of people would still be alive in this world. People who enjoyed involving other innocent clan members and instilling terror in other people. Without enough strength, no one would want to pick a fight with people like these.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, if you can trap us here, not only will the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord be removed from the list of the Seven Stars, they will even disappear from the World of the Nine Continents. The question is that, do you feel that you can do it?” The old man started laughing loudly. He seemed as if he just heard the funniest joke in the world.</p>
 <p>“I’m really curious how you guys from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord managed to live up till now. I finally know why you guys from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord want to unite yourself with Di Clan by marriage! It’s to make sure your old nest wouldn’t be annihilated while you people are away!” Qing Shui stared at the old man’s eyes as he spoke slowly.</p>
 <p>For a moment, the old man seemed as if he felt nervous. It’s human nature to feel suspicious. Qing Shui was aware that he might be suspecting that Qing Shui had other helpers to help him lay hands on the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. For example, Qianyu Clan, Nian Feng’s grandpa, maybe even Di Clan or some other clans from the Seven Stars Country which wanted to replace the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, you still have to die today! Don’t tell other people that I, Ba Donghe am bullying you.

To top it all off, you are someone from Green Cloud Continent.” A ruthless and persistent look slowly emerged from the old man’s face.</p>
