 <p><strong>AST 648 - Accepting the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected that the person to declare the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death would be the Young Master. From this, Qing Shui could already tell that this man was in a considerably high position in Ten Thousand Poisons Sect because he was the only young man among the group.</p>
 <p>Despite the young man’s age, his strength was already slightly superior to Di Chen’s. Since he was the young master of Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, he should be an expert in poison. To poison experts, their strength wasn't their most terrifying weapons. The most terrifying ones were their poisons and poisonous substances. In fact, there were some poisons which were capable of instantaneously murdering people, making people lose all their senses or even captivating them. If that happened, the only fate that awaited them would be death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained silent in these circumstances. After all, he didn't have the right to intervene in the relationship between Di Clan and Ten Thousand Poisons Sect. However, just because one didn't talk, it didn't mean that they wouldn't need to do so.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what do you think?” Even Di Fentian was hesitant facing a matter which could decide the fate of the clan. This was a major incident. Therefore, he fixed his sight on Qing Shui, after all, the brother-in-law seemed to be very mysterious and possessed very unique abilities.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly while looking at Di Fentian: “It there a limit to the number of people taking part in the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had actually had this question in his mind for a long time. He knew that the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death was a battle to the death between members of different sects, it wouldn't stop until everyone from one side collapsed.</p>
 <p>If the opponent limited their participants to one-versus-one matches, Qing Shui would reject it. Qing Shui’s strategy was to work in teams with the people from Di Clan and face off their opponents one at a time. With his Pure Jade Pellet as well as supplementary techniques, he doubted that they would be able to take advantage of them.</p>
 <p>“There is a limit. There can only be a maximum of five participants and a minimum of two participants on the stage at a time. This is a battle between two forces, hence, it's not going to be like the ordinary kind of one on one showdown.” Di Fentian said happily after staring blankly for awhile before figuring out an answer.</p>
 <p>“The seniors from Di Clan may not be here, but having pushed to this point, if we do not accept this challenge it will seem like Di Clan is a lot weaker than others. We can't lose our pride even if it means losing. Brother Tian, I believe that the seniors will also take this challenge if they’re here.” Qing Shui smiled as he tried to convince Di Fentian.</p>
 <p>After getting Qing Shui’s confirmation, Di Fentian glanced towards the Young Master and smiled: “Di Clan will accept the challenge. In three days, we will meet at the Seven Stars Battle Arena along Seven Stars Street.</p>
 <p>“Right! Great! Take this!”</p>
 <p>The Young Master extended his hand and threw out a red colored Beast Parchment. The letters written on it looked really clear and tidy, it even gave off a solemn and stirring feeling.</p>
 <p>Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death!</p>
 <p>Those were the largest letters that Qing Shui saw on it. He didn't proceed to read any further, nor did he feel like it. Since things had developed to this point, it basically meant that one would not be able to get out unless the enemy got eliminated. Both sides were just using this method so that they can leave some of the innocent people in their clan alive in case they lose.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the elderly men not far away were all smiling. They all possessed extraordinary strength but the one with the long and thin brows in particular, the elderly man known as “Brother Qian Xi”, was so strong that even Qing Shui wasn't able to see through him. Nevertheless, he could faintly feel that the elderly man was a Grade Ten Martial Saint. That was why Qing Shui dared to take up the challenge. Furthermore, it does not matter if they accept the challenge or not, the result will still be the same.</p>
 <p>After accepting the challenge, the people from both the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect and Sima Clan left one after another. Even Sima Yanming left. As he was leaving, he behaved really formally and manly, just like when he arrived.</p>
 <p>So it was all just an act…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected it to be an act, even he was deceived by it. All of this was done so that Di Clan would be forced to accept their challenge.</p>
 <p>After their enemies left, the people from Di Clan all turned silent. The Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death was no small matter. This was an upgraded version of the death match between two people. This was a battle to the death between two clans!</p>
 <p>“Big brother, are we being too reckless?” Di Fenxing asked Di Fentian.</p>
 <p>“It doesn't matter anymore. We had no choice but to accept it under the circumstances. If we don't, it's very likely that they’ll just kill us off right here. It's just that in exchange for that, they would have to bear the name of villains. If it's Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, they would definitely do it. In fact, they have the power to do so.” Di Fentian let out a sigh and said.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, it seems like things will not go as smoothly now. If Ten Thousand Poisons Sect was to unite all five of their clans, wouldn't that end up being a one-sided massacre?” Di Fenxing said furiously.</p>
 <p>“Uniting the five clans?” Qing Shui glanced towards Di Fenxing in confusion.</p>
 <p>“The Ten Thousand Poisons Sect is really close to Sima Clan. This is because there are a lot of people from Sima Clan in the sect itself. Sima Clan is considered one of the forces of Ten Thousand Poisons Sect. Other than Sima Clan, there are still Zhuo Clan which came the other day, Guan Clan and Du Clan. Often, the three clans relied on Ten Thousand Poisons Sect to survive. Hence, it's quite normal for them to appear this time. In terms of skill, they’re considered one of the strongest one outside of Seven Stars Country. They even have quite a few experts.” Di Fenxing explained to Qing Shui bitterly.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go back and discuss this with father and grandpa first.” Di Fentian said while shaking his head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the gang had no choice but to nod their heads. They rode on the Beast cart and returned to Di Clan. Qing Shui never expected another problem to arise right after he solved the issue with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and realized Di Chen’s wish. Furthermore, the incident this time was even tougher.</p>
 <p>Three days, this would mean five months for Qing Shui. It was neither short nor long. Hence, Qing Shui was thinking about whether he could do anything during this time.</p>
 <p>Very quickly they were already back in Di Clan. When they stepped in, everyone from Di Clan was already there, including the side branches of the clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that they had already found out about it. Along the way back, a lot of people had already started discussing the incident regarding Di Clan and Ten Thousand Poisons Sect in Seven Stars City. Qing Shui knew that the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect was responsible for spreading the rumors.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa! Father!” Di Fentian called of to Di Xuan and grandpa Di Xiong anxiously.</p>
 <p>“You guys are back. Come, we will talk about it inside.” Di Xiong smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that everyone from Di Clan looked really stressed. Even Di Jing didn't complain like he usually did. After all, he wasn't all that stupid.</p>
 <p>“Senior, why didn't Old Lady Mo come out?” Qing Shui asked in confusion.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan knitted his brows: “I was about to tell you. It seemed like she wasn't feeling well, she is resting in her room.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, you guys can go in first then, I'll go take a look at her.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui greeted everyone while Di Chen stood beside him and told him that he wanted to go with him to see Old Lady Mo. After they bid their goodbyes to everyone, they proceeded to her room together.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, how do you think things will turn out this time?” Di Chen asked Qing Shui in concern, she had also realized that things were a bit unusual.</p>
 <p>“Don't worry, it will be fine.” Qing Shui said gently. Actually, he was not confident and only said this to comfort her.</p>
 <p>“If you were to leave now, will they stop you? Or rather, could they?” Di Chen asked Qing Shui after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Here it goes again. Come on, stop thinking so much. Do you really think that I'll abandon you and leave on my own? Is the guy you love such a coward?” Qing Shui held Di Chen’s hand and said.</p>
 <p>“Don't be rude Qing Shui! I know you aren't someone like that but you need to think about Mingyue, Liu-Li and the others. You need to think about your son and daughter too, can you bear to see them growing up fatherless?” Di Chen felt hurt when she was saying this. When making decisions like this, it's similar to when someone needs to choose between cutting off their hands or dying, it's extremely painful. There would be no way to enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently slapped Di Chen’s curved and bulging butt.</p>
 <p>“You pervert, bastard, you bullied me.” Di Chen blushed and said angrily.</p>
 <p>“It doesn't matter if you’re right or wrong with your previous statement. I, as a man, need to be responsible even if it means what I'm doing is wrong. There are some things which I can't choose, just like now, even if it means dying, I need to die earlier than you.” Qing Shui said gently but in a firm tone. The sincerity in his statement was unwavering.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen gently called out to Qing Shui with a face filled with happiness and smile.</p>
 <p>“Yeah!”</p>
 <p>Di Chen gently embraced Qing Shui’s neck and whispered in his ear: “You’re not allowed to hit me without my permission next time.”</p>
 <p>“Hey young lady, do you seriously expect me to wait until you say something like Qing Shui, quickly come here and hit my butt?” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Are you looking for death?!”</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the two arrived in front of Old Lady Mo’s room. Qing Shui extended his hand and gently knocked on the door. After a while, the door opened, Old Lady Mo was stunned when she saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Granny, are you not feeling well?” Qing Shui asked. He had heard Old Lady Mo’s story before. There was a reason why she decided to reduce her strength down to her present level.</p>
 <p>“Nah it's nothing, just something that comes with age. Every time after I fight, I'll feel weak for up to half a month. It seems that it’ll be really hard for me to help you this time.” Old Lady Mo said in sorrow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Chen followed the elderly woman into her room. Actually, prior to this, Qing Shui could already smell a faint medicine scent. As soon as he stepped in, the smell became even heavier.</p>
 <p>“Granny, are you making medicines?” Qing Shui asked while sniffing the air.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, no choice, the meridians all over my body feel really painful.” Old Lady Mo looked very pale. She seemed to even be having trouble with normal actions. Indeed, she seemed to be suffering.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui released his spiritual sense and noticed that Old Lady Mo’s meridians were bloated and red. It seemed like the symptoms of an overexertion of strength.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui was aware that this wasn't the case for Old Lady Mo. Qing Shui smelled something familiar in the air, the Thousand Years Ghost Vine Flower.</p>
 <p>The Thousand Years Ghost Vine Flower, this kind of medicine could increase the tenacity of one’s meridians. It's also a medicine which could reduce the pain and injury of meridians. As soon as Qing Shui smelled it, he already knew that Old Lady Mo had injured her meridians. Either she was poisoned or she was hurt by shockwaves. Her meridians didn't actually break, but their toughness was weakened. This was also the reason why her strength got reduced. In fact, not only did it get reduced, it seemed to have a huge after-effect on her too.</p>
 <p>“Granny, are your meridians feeling really painful?” Qing Shui asked calmly as he took out two Gold Needles.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I forgot, you are a genius doctor. Unfortunately, the rest of the doctors said that my wounds are incurable.” Old Lady Mo shook her head and smiled.</p>
