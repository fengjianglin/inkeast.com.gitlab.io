 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he went through the valley, the next thing which came into his sight was yet another valley. However, the mountain started to look indistinct beyond the distance of five hundred meters. Furthermore, there was also an intense murderous aura being emitted from the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui halted his step. In his consciousness, an enormous red area was spotted right in front of him. The entire area was covered in red, bloody red color and it was giving out a very vicious aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a formation! A killing formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sensed the aura of the formation and it was very terrifying. Suddenly, it became clear to Qing Shui that Shen Huang might have been trapped by this formation, otherwise, it would be impossible for the opponent to deal with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped, however, at this moment, a voice came through, “Let me be honest with you, what’s in front of you is the Nine Heavenly Immortal Slaying Great Formation. She is right within it. If you really want to save her, go down and look for her!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I haven’t seen her with my own eyes, how would I know if she is in it? Do you seriously think that I will be so gullible?” Qing Shui was trying hard to feel the surrounding as he spoke. However, the opponent’s voice was an echo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw a spot with pretty Melodious Platform Stones. The opponent’s voice reflected through the stone and went into his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s up to you whether to believe it or not. If you don’t, wait to take her corpse. Oh yes, she isn’t the only one that’s in it. I am not sure if any accidents will happen. Have you seen those pink aura? It’s used to promote estrus.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when he finished speaking, the voice started to break into laughter. Qing Shui seemed to be looking at the faint pink color. Meanwhile, he had already released a few Jade Emperor Bees quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui already expected that the enemies would soon discover the presence of the Jade Emperor Bee in this valley. Thus, he made up his mind to use them as baits. As long as Qing Shui could locate the source of the voice, he would be able to defeat the enemy. He mustn’t act rashly nor recklessly, otherwise, not only would he fail to save Shen Huang, but he might also lose his life as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such an insignificant trick!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a cold snort, a Jade Emperor Bee immediately turned into dust, but thanks to the attack, Qing Shui managed to memorize the enemy’s aura with his formidable Spiritual Sense. By tracking the aura, he managed to find the hiding spot of the opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was able to see the entire person in his consciousness. He should be quite young considering he had a middle-aged look; he was hiding in a place where Qing Shui didn’t expect him to be. Initially, it was impossible for Qing Shui’s Spiritual Sense to sense him. Luckily, he made a mistake just now by making his move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At where the opponent was, there was also a gigantic size man almost at the size of a tower. He was as black as carbon. Qing Shui suspected that black people also existed within this world. However, the gigantic man had the face of a genuine eastern man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui continued to move forward like he hadn’t noticed their presence. However, if one looked closely, they would know that he was slowly approaching the area where the two people were hiding. It was just that he was moving at a very slow pace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui seemed like he was trying to approach the formation, he was actually trying to get close to their hiding place. He felt that it would be safer this way. Actually, it would still be all right if he was to confront them now. He was just afraid that anything unexpected might happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And I thought you care a lot about her, it seems that you are just another person who fears death.” The voice once again came through. This time, if Qing Shui looked closely, he would know that it was the Formation Master that was talking, because he could see his lips moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when he finished speaking, Qing Shui immediately noticed something fishy going on. He quickly charged towards them and in a flash, he was already in front of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Palace Step… It enabled him to travel the distance in a flash. In just a few movements, he already arrived in front of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black guy screamed out loud while swinging both of his fists towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a cold smile on his face. Simultaneously, he also greeted it back with his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous force of impact immediately blew the black guy backward. In terms of cultivation, the Formation Master also seemed to be quite hopeless, he immediately tried to run away. Formation Master could escape easier than the average people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a flash, his figure disappeared from where he initially was. After that, he immediately appeared beside the black guy and grabbed onto him before he disappeared again. Before he left, he didn’t forget to taunt Qing Shui, “Catch me if you can!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had underestimated Qing Shui’s ability; Qing Shui was also a Formation Master. He actually thought that he could escape from Qing Shui by relying on the simplest Confounding Step and Formation Step. Like before, Qing Shui continued to show a cold smile. At the next instant, he immediately appeared in front of them and dropped his fingers on both of their Shanzhong Acupoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shanzhong Acupoint was a deadly acupoint. However, Qing Shui didn’t kill them. At least for now, he wouldn’t want them to die immediately. Though they didn’t die, they still spurted out fresh blood as Qing Shui poked them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Shui wasn’t an assassin, he had the quickest and most fatal method to kill someone. His ability to hit on a person’s acupoint as well as snapping their meridians was a very fearsome battle technique. Furthermore, he could also use it through his weapons. At the moment, Qing Ming was also cultivating this ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only Qing Ming, Qing Yin also cultivated the Taichi Fist, she could snap acupoints and meridians. By relying on enough speed, they could win against a stronger opponent. It was an unexpected trick and futile to guard against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me, who is after me and the Phoenix God Organization?” Qing Shui consumed everything into the Nine Palace. They couldn’t escape even if they wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” The formation master snorted coldly and remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed a faint smile on his face. He then poked them a few times with his finger. As he did so, their expression started to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, they felt as if thousands of parasitic worms were tearing their bodies. The intense itchy, painful and disgusting sensation down to their core was very hard to imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge black guy even began to scream out in agony. It was as if he had run into a demon, he looked very terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the Formation Master also didn’t seem to be coping so well with it. After holding on for a while, the black guy was no longer able to hold on and said, “I will tell you everything you want to know!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui patiently released the black guy. He was willing to release whoever that was willing to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old Formation Master was also unable to withstand it and it was futile for him to hold on. He said in a weak tone, “Me too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is someone who is willing to speak now. I don’t need you to do so.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>

He sounded very anxious. It could be seen that he didn’t want to suffer more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui released him. That was precisely what he wanted to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me, who is the one that’s after me and Shen Huang?” Qing Shui asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jin Feng, the Heavy Region Sword Sect and the Shadow Phoenix Pavilion.” The Formation Master said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hand and once again poked their acupoints. He also did it to the black guy to let them feel the pain from before. Qing Shui was able to analyze the things which he just said with his Spiritual Sense and it was likely to be a lie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Shadow Phoenix Pavilion isn’t a part of it.” The black guy quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hand and released them. Then he said softly, “I can clearly feel when you guys are lying. There is no more next time, or else, I will let you suffer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, they viewed Qing Shui as an existence more fearsome than a demon. Even a demon wasn’t as ruthless as him when it came to torturing someone.</span></p>

Nevertheless, deep down, he was worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. The three Sect Lords of the Heavy Region Sword Sect are inside along with Jin Feng. I think it’s very hard for Shen Huang to gain any advantages from them, even without the Aphrodisiac that causes an effect on her body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They have already taken the antidote in advance.”</span></p>
