 <p><strong>AST 925 - Powerful Binding Formation, Eating the Forbidden Fruit</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still very happy. After all, he could now use the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation. He didn't understand why he hadn't thought of setting up a Spirit Gathering Formation here at this stage. Back then, he had tried endless times and had even used the ingredients from powerful demonic beasts to make formation flags. However, he still hadn't succeeded.</p>
 <p>In fact, Qing Shui knew that the most important reason was that in his consciousness, there was no mention of putting up a Spirit Gathering Formation in the eye of the formation. He had trusted the things that had appeared in his consciousness too much. This event let Qing Shui understand that there might be some things which might not be perfect.</p>
 <p>"Come, let's go take a look at this formation." Since Qing Shui was in the formation, he naturally could tell what the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation was like.</p>
 <p>"Mmm!" Mu Qing replied happily. She knew that she had succeeded in setting up the formation and then saw Qing Shui's elated expression and unknowingly felt happy as well. She even realized that her joy was not because she had succeeded in forming the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation, but because she could help Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>A world could be found in a single flower!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could now sense how amazing this Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation was. Taking this one step suddenly brought him into a new world and when he took one step back, he discovered that it was not the place it previously was.</p>
 <p>This was a world of ice and snow, where the piercing cold was like sharp blades. Not far away, there was a group of ice bears which was about the size of the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King. Their tremendous howls sounded like they were going to tear the skies apart.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dare to go up against them head on. There were too many of them. Moreover, he still had to look for Mu Qing. He performed the Nine Palace Steps. The Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation basically was adding the Nine Palace positioning onto the Eight Trigrams Formation and only the Nine Palace Steps would allow one to be able to move swiftly like a fish in the water in this formation. It allowed one to freely move about just by taking one step, thus Qing Shui was now feeling very excited. Lifting up one foot, he directly jumped out of that area.</p>
 <p>The place earlier should be one of the eight gates in the Eight Trigrams Formation. However, after taking this step, Qing Shui was stunned. There was a lady standing not far from there, with an amiable smile and looking at him.</p>
 <p>"Mother!" Qing Shui shouted out in surprise and dashed over. However, he was suddenly stunned.</p>
 <p>Gate of Illusion!</p>
 <p>A drip of cold perspiration appeared on Qing Shui's head. He knew that this was not his mother but he still walked over slowly. He knew that this was an illusion in the Gate of Illusion. However, this was something created from Spiritual Qi and there was also a strong killing intent. If he wasn't careful, he could be killed easily.</p>
 <p>Thank goodness that the illusionary character had not spoken. It might be because the level of the formation was not high enough. Qing Shui took a casual step forward and then came to a stop. After a few breaths' time, the person dashed out, attacking towards Qing Shui...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui calculated the time. If he had forgotten everything earlier and dashed over, even if he hadn't died, he would have suffered some serious injuries. After all, he wouldn't have his guard up against his own mother.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dodged and just looked on. In the end, he let out a sigh and left. He missed his family too much...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still knew some general knowledge with regard to the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation. After a slight hesitation, Qing Shui performed the Nine Palace Steps. When he came to a stop, he realized that Mu Qing was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
 <p>Another Nine Palace Steps...</p>
 <p>The things he encountered in the process made him increasingly excited. The powers of this binding formation, when added with the Nine Palace positionings, were simply too heaven-defying. If it was just an ordinary cultivator, even a powerful one, would feel at a loss and could even perish in the formation.</p>
 <p>Of course, this would be dependent on the formation's prowess. Otherwise, absolute power would definitely be able to destroy the formation.</p>
 <p>Each time around, Qing Shui would remember the positioning and it was only on his seventh attempt that he saw Mu Qing and the 13th attempt before he arrived next to her. When he saw Mu Qing, he grabbed her hand.</p>
 <p>The formation was heartless and if Mu Qing had came across that group of ice bears earlier, it would probably be tough for her to handle them. Formations don't recognize people and would not refrain from attacking a person just because the person was the one who set up the formation.</p>
 <p>When she saw Qing Shui disappearing earlier, she had felt worried. However, she didn't move. When she saw Qing Shui appearing again he grabbed her hand worriedly, she smiled. This was the first time he had grabbed her unknowingly, all because he was worried about her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the faint smile on Mu Qing's beautiful face and quickly let go of her hand. However, he grabbed her hand once again, saying helplessly, "Try using your Four Phases Steps. See how it works in this formation."</p>
 <p>Mu Qing nodded and grabbed onto Qing Shui's hand tightly. She then performed the Four Phases Steps and darted about in the formation. With Qing Shui next to her, she was fearless. However, she would still pay attention to her surroundings.</p>
 <p>The Four Phases Steps was too different from the Nine Palace Steps. However, it could still be used for moving about in the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation. In fact, as long as one was proficient in the area of formations and Nine Palace positionings, even an ordinary person would be able to enter and exit the formation freely.</p>
 <p>The formation was filled with dangers, but there were still many spots which would always be safe. As long as one was proficient in formations, the person would be able to enter and exit those safe areas freely. However, they couldn't kill enemies since once the enemies got near and also landed in the safe zones, then the user would be in hot soup.</p>
 <p>Therefore, it was better for the person who set up the formation to be powerful. Only this would allow the user to unleash the full potential of the formations.</p>
 <p>Although this was also the first time Qing Shui had entered the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation, he was extremely familiar with the place. Or rather, it could be said that he could skillfully sense, as well as enter and exit whenever there was a change.</p>
 <p>This was the result of powerful spirit energy and the Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>However, right now Mu Qing was the one taking the lead, while Qing Shui was acting as the guard while familiarizing himself with the formation. The more Mu Qing explored the place, the more excited she felt. She held Qing Shui's hand and continued to dart about through the spaces and didn't even feel scared when they were chased by those powerful demonic beasts. It was because she knew that this guy next to her would be able to protect her at any time.</p>
 <p>However, when she recalled how he would be leaving in about half a month, her grip on Qing Shui's hand tightened.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui and Mu Qing used the Four Phases Steps to escape from a group of Double-Winged Lightning Tiger, suddenly a group of Blazing Flame Wolves suddenly appeared before them. There were at least 1,000 of them and the series of deafening wolf howls caused one to feel the shivers.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing stopped and looked at Qing Shui. Her thoughts were very clear, there was no escape.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried her up horizontally, unleashed a few Nine Palace Steps and arrived at a safe spot.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing’s beautiful arms circled around Qing Shui's neck and she quietly rested her head against his chest. Qing Shui was just about to put her down.</p>
 <p>"Don't move!" Mu Qing's lazy voice rang out, causing Qing Shui's bones to feel weak.</p>
 <p>From the first time he had met her, Qing Shui could tell that she wasn't a lady who would be cute and reliant. She was like a dignified and proud phoenix, with an aloofness that sank deep into her bones. The feeling she gave out wouldn't let one feel put off but rather, make a guy feel inferior. However, when a lady like her suddenly become like a tame sheep, that extremely visual impact caused Qing Shui to space out.</p>
 <p>Being able to smell that faint fragrance and feel that soft body in his arms, he would be lying if he said that his thoughts had not run wild. In terms of relationships, he still couldn't make himself to take the initiative. He felt very conflicted.</p>
 <p>"If you were to tempt me even more, don't blame me for not holding back. I'm trying very hard to hold back right now." Qing Shui lowered Mu Qing slightly and she suddenly felt that something was hitting against her butt.</p>
 <p>She trembled and got down, looking at Qing Shui. Her heart was beating very fast. Although she didn't have any interactions with guys, she knew what went on in a relationship. She felt very anxious and a little scared.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a little regretful. His actions earlier had been a little flirty. After all, the two of them were just friends. He thought of how his hand had touched her before, had hugged her and now...</p>
 <p>It wasn't that Qing Shui didn't like her. There were probably not many guys who wouldn't like a beauty like her. Moreover, they had been through trials before. Most importantly, she liked him, but only held some restraint because of her pride. However, she was rational and intelligent and didn't want to miss out the chance and thus she had been trying to express herself to him all this while. This was despite knowing that he had wives.</p>
 <p>"Mu Qing!"</p>
 <p>Mu Qing looked at Qing Shui, her blush still on her face. Although she had let loose of a little of her restraint, if anything were to happen, she wasn't ready for it yet.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held her hand and walked slowly in the formation. Hand in hand, their hearts were palpitating.</p>
 <p>"You're very independent and I already have quite a few women," Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</p>
 <p>"You're afraid that I won't be able to get along with them?" Mu Qing smiled and asked, still blushing. Her words had clearly expressed her feelings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned as well before he looked at Mu Qing, "You've really decided?"</p>
 <p>"You want me?" Mu Qing's eyes lit up as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged her tightly and said to her in a soft voice, "I want you. I don't know if I love you but I know that I like you a lot. I like your smile, I like looking at you and I don't wish to see you sad. The reason I'm doing all this for the Mu Clan is all because of you. If someone were to lay their hands on you, I won't allow it, no matter who they are. Is my desire to monopolize too strong? I'm only afraid that you'll feel aggrieved if you were to be with me."</p>
 <p>Mu Qing's body was slightly stiff at the start but she gradually relaxed. She put her hands around Qing Shui's neck and looked at him happily. At this moment, she felt very satisfied.</p>
 <p>"I don't feel aggrieved! I love you! But I'm not ready yet..." Mu Qing flushed and said softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also turned red because he had had a reaction. Of course, Mu Qing sensed it as well.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, before you're ready, I won't eat you up. I'll wait for you to ask me to eat you up." Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
 <p>"Stop saying rubbish!" Mu Qing didn't lift her head and pounded Qing Shui, chiding.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p>The two of them hugged for a while before Mu Qing spoke up softly.</p>
 <p>"Mmmm!"</p>
 <p>"Can... can you kiss me...?" Mu Qing buried her head in Qing Shui's neck and said in an extremely soft voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was taken back. He couldn't tell if this proud lady wanted to know what a kiss felt like or was trying to provide his reaction with some relief...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also feeling slightly agitated and excited. After all, it had been very long since he had touched a woman. He lifted up Mu Qing's chin. Right now, her beautiful eyes were very soft and she was extremely charming.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a surge of evilness gushing up within him and he landed an intense kiss on those sexy and trembling lips...</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had taken out his bed from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Right now, under the blankets, Mu Qing was in Qing Shui's arms. The two of them had ended up taking the forbidden fruit.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Qing Shui had even given his promise, but he hadn't expected this lady's expressions to make him lose all of his senses. Moreover, they had already affirmed their relationship and were both mature adults. Furthermore, this could also increase both of their abilities. The union of Yin and Yang was the greatest bliss in this world. She was slightly older than him, but yet was still a virgin...</p>
