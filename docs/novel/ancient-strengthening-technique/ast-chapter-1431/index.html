 <p><strong>AST 1431 - Not One Left Behind, Ancient Forest, Ancient Fire Snake</strong></p>
 <p>Demon Lord Palace had suffered quite bit of damage as well, although it was quite negligible compared to Dragon Palace.</p>
 <p>Blood-curdling screeches and battle cries - the scene was certainly lively. Once Qing Shui and crew found a strong martial artist, they would directly kill them. They did not give the opposition a chance to use any Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques. No one was allowed to live.</p>
 <p>It was a massacre, a one-sided massacre. This result was unbelievable. Qing Shui knew that the surrounding people could see everything. Just like this, 5000 Dragon Palace members were wiped out. These were all highly skilled martial artists, the core of their forces. These 5000 made up of more than half of the strength of the Dragon Palace, all that remained were 100,000 members that made up the other half. Dragon Palace was waning, and they still had lost even with two dragon tamers. What was even worse for them was that the two dragon tamers were dead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly collected all the resources from the Green Dragon. Injuries were unavoidable during battles such as these, and so he took out several medicinal pellets to aid people in their treatment. Many of them recovered quickly, but those that died did not leave behind anything.</p>
 <p>Though he was a bit sad, it was still a huge victory that was worth celebrating.</p>
 <p>After cleaning up the battlefield and collecting Interspatial Silk Sachets and whatnot, everything that was collected was handed over to the Demon Lord. The Demon Lord then handed everything to Qing Shui. Qing Shui laughed as he saw the amount of Interspatial Silk Sachets, “Lets share everything.”</p>
 <p>At the end, each person was given an Interspatial Silk Sachet, several of the formidable elder martial artists’ Interspatial Silk Sachets were given to Qing Shui. He waved his arm and stored the sachets away, leaving everyone shocked. They knew that an Interspatial Silk Sachet could not store other Interspatial Silk Sachets. Interspatial type things simply could not store Interspatial type things.</p>
 <p>The Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was a heaven-rebelling existence. Everything besides living humans and things that did not fit within the realm could be stored inside.</p>
 <p>Other people branded their Interspatial Silk Sachet and kept it on their bodies.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not give the two women any, as he felt that they would not have wanted it. He would compensate them with other things, naturally having to share the goods with them.</p>
 <p>After taking care of things here, he directly used Nine Continents Step to leave. This place was covered in a gigantic forest that was beyond belief. It was filled with trees the height of skyscrapers. In the forest, there was a lake, river, small hills… The entire sky was being blocked, thus the area looked a bit dark.</p>
 <p>Ancient Forest!</p>
 <p>Arriving the Ancient Forest, the rumored Ancient Divine Shrine was within the Ancient Forest. This was an extremely dangerous existence. Not only did he need prevent the dangers associated with ancient giant beasts, he also needed to ward off human attacks.</p>
 <p>The forest occasionally had damaged trees where the sunlight could seep through the forest. Here, the trees were at least 1000 meters in height. Their thickness was shocking.</p>
 <p>“Here in the Ancient Forest, everyone please be careful. This Ancient Forest has many formidable beasts, the trees are also very strong, the treetops were not damaged from one thing alone. There are extremely poisonous toxic insects, snakes and the like. There could also be countless ancient beasts, with many different types. These are the most threatening existence in all of Ancient Ruins.” Hua Rumei said as she walked.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an Ancient Fire Snake appeared in front of them as they were walking forward. It was ten meters wide, emitting a golden flame that was several meters tall from head to toe. The snake had a height of 400 meters and it slithered about within the forest. The surrounding trees did not have a single scratch. Everyone was shocked as they saw the Ancient Fire Snake.</p>
 <p>It was too stimulating for the visual sense. Compared to the Green Dragon, its look was decent and it was emitting an ancient but formidable aura. It belonged to the Fire Dragon kind, as it had the Fire Dragon bloodline within its body.</p>
 <p>What appeared now was a snake and not some dragon head, yet it was a high tier snake type. Just like the legendary Nine-headed Snake, at the end of the day it was still a snake without the option of ever evolving into a dragon. However, it was several times more powerful compared to a dragon.</p>
 <p>This ancient beast was not afraid when it saw Qing Shui and the others. It rushed towards several of the people. This Ancient Fire Snake’s strength was immense, though it was not comparable to the Blue Dragon or Green Dragon. It was about the same as the Old Turtle and not far off from the dragons.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>Before the snake arrived, it opened its mouth widely and spitted out a concentrated flame.</p>
 <p>Solar True Fire……</p>
 <p>Once Qing Shui saw the flames, his expression changed. He used the Nine Continents Mountain to directly block the giant flame.</p>
 <p>“Everyone else retreat!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui commanded them. The prank had gone too far. He summoned the Dragon Slaying Beast, then to debuff it for 20%, he quickly used Emperor’s Qi.</p>
 <p>Hiss, hiss!</p>
 <p>The ring of flame spat out by the Ancient Fire Snake was blocked, its body swept over horizontally. The flame on its body was not affected by its speed.</p>
 <p>Xiu Xiu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly took out the Soulshake Bell and aimed it towards the Ancient Fire Snake as he shook it. The sharp noises would cause the beast listening to it to feel like their soul was leaving their body. The target of the Soulshake Bell was locked on, capable of being either single target or multi-target.</p>
 <p>The bells’ consecutive shaking had the Ancient Fire Snake’s body trembling, its speed reduced. At this very moment, the Dragon Slaying Beast poked a giant hole through the snake’s body.</p>
 <p>Hiss Hiss…</p>
 <p>“Stop, I give in. You actually had the Destruction Beast.” A screeching noise like fingernails scratching on metal was transmitted over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Dragon Slaying Beast stop after the unexpected outcome. The thing about Destruction Beast was that Qing Shui thought it was talking about the Dragon Slaying Beast. But why was it called the Destruction Beast? Did the Green Dragon not know about the Destruction Beast?</p>
 <p>“Older sister, are you interested in keeping it as your battle partner?” Qing Shui turned around and asked Hua Rumei.</p>
 <p>“Me? Can I?” Hua Rumei was shocked and asked. She had wanted a battle beast for her own, a formidable battle beast. She was most definitely satisfied with the Ancient Fire Snake in front of her.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei already had a mount, but it did not help her in battle. Demon Lord had the Old Turtle which was an Ancient Rare Species, it knew several Heavenly Techniques, and its speed and battle prowess was also very strong.</p>
 <p>“Of course. Feed it this and it will be your tamed beast afterwards.” Qing Shui took out a bottle of Mid Grade Sacred Beast Pill.</p>
 <p>After many years, Qing Shui had refined some Mid Grade Sacred Beast Pills. The materials were overly valuable, however, so he could not mass produce it. Moreover, each person had a limit on its use. If they were not beast tamers, they could not use more than one or two pills. Qing Shui had not tried Double Portion or Quadruple Port Medicine, he felt it would not affect the effects of the Sacred Beast Pills.</p>
 <p>With Hua Rumei’s strength, using the mid grade Sacred Beast Pill on the Ancient Fire Snake should not incur any accidents. Seeing the Ancient Fire Snake’s resentment in its eyes, however, Qing Shui wanted to rid his mind of any thoughts of worry.</p>
 <p>“Older sister, take out your weapon and come over.”</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei was stunned but still took out a pair of blood-red thorns, then walked over to the Ancient Fire Snake.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that once the Ancient Fire Snake had seen Hua Rumei’s weapon, it obediently opened its mouth and swallowed the mid grade Sacred Beast Pill. As Qing Shui was not stingy, he took out several items for beast consumption, including Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei happily fed the Ancient Fire Snake. This trick was effective without fail. After all, it made Hua Rumei into a beast tamer. With the imposing effects of the Sacred Beast Pill, neither would allow the other to receive a fatal blow. With this human giving it such benefits, staying by her side was not such a bad idea.</p>
 <p>He never thought that they would receive such a huge gift from the Ancient Forest. The Ancient Fire Snake was a formidable beast, and although its defense was not comparable to the Old Turtle, its attack and destructive power was stronger than the Old Turtle after it had consumed the Ancient Demonic Fruit.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Fire Snake was a mutated species. Its fire had mutated to Solar True Fire, therefore its power was horrifying. The flame was comparable to Hellfire Phoenix’s Hell flame. The only reason he did not tame it himself was for the Demon Lord Palace.</p>
 <p>The strength of this beast was attractive to Qing Shui, but Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Fire Bird’s strength was too far apart from the Ancient Fire Snake, so his urge to tame it was not big. One person’s formidability was not comparable to a full group’s formidability, he had already begun raising the strength of reliable people around him when opportunity arose.</p>
 <p>Was Hua Rumei reliable? The answer was certainly yes. Qing Shui had saved her life before, and he had saved Zhan Yu’s life. Given Hua Rumei’s personality, even if she had to sacrifice Zhan Yu, she would not do anything to harm Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei was the Demon Lord’s left and right arms, the relationship between the two was not simple. They were similar to sisters; their two weapons were from the same hands.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei’s power was Demon Lord Palace’s power. Now that he was part of Demon Lord Palace, if there were no unforeseen circumstances, he would not leave the Demon Lord Palace. Unless, that woman did not want him there.</p>
 <p>Ancient Fire Snake’s flames emitted from its body could be retracted. Once the flames were out, it showed of a spirited golden snake. His flames were gold in color. It was really close with Hua Rumei…</p>
 <p>Demon Lord did not have much change in her expression. At the start, when Qing Shui had mentioned the Destruction Beast or told Hua Rumei to take the Ancient Fire Snake as a battle beast, the Demon Lord had looked at Qing Shui several times.</p>
 <p>This could be considered as a joyous occasion for Demon Lord Palace as their strength had increased significantly. Not to mention, Qing Shui had helped Battle Pavilion with their formation techniques, which also helped them raise the strength a bit.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui looked at the Ancient Fire Snake. This thing lived here for so long, it should know the Ancient Divine Shrine’s existence. Moreover, it should be familiar with the topography of the area. In a battle, the Ancient Fire Snake would provide a big advantage.</p>
 <p>“Brother Snake, do you know the Ancient Divine Shrine?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s way of addressing it was not strange, as a formidable Ancient Fire Snake had more than enough status to be addressed this way.</p>
 <p>“Ancient Divine Shrine? You guys and those people are both going to the Ancient Divine Shrine?” A metal screeching sounding noise resounded.</p>
 <p>“Those people?” Qing Shui asked puzzled, it would seem the Justice Alliance members have already arrived.</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Divine Shrine already has lots of people, but they can’t enter. There is a Ancient Formation and also Guardian Ancient Beasts.” Ancient Fire Snake’s sharp voice was very calm this time.</p>
 <p>“Are the Guardian Ancient Beasts of the Ancient Divine Shrine strong? How many are there? Are they stronger than Brother Snake?” Qing Shui asked consecutively.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know how many, but they are stronger than me. Entering the Divine Shrine is no easy task.”</p>
 <p>At the end, Qing Shui had the Ancient Fire Snake take them to the shortest route towards the Ancient Divine Shrine. Even if it was not far, it would still take ten days to half a month’s time to reach it.</p>
 <p>Ancient Fire Snake was the king in this area. With him here, the journey was especially peaceful. Qing Shui did not use Nine Continents Step to familiarize himself with the topography of the area.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not ask any more things about the Ancient Divine Shrine, and that was because he knew the Ancient Fire Snake probably did not know. Moreover, Ancient Ruins did not have only one Ancient Divine Shrine. There were also many Ancient Ruins, each Ancient Divine Shrine with different items in it. It all depended on fate. Some Ancient Divine Shrines did not have restrictions, but others have Ancient Formations or Guardian Ancient Beasts.</p>
