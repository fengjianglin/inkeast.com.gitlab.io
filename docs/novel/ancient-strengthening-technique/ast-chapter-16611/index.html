 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunset Palace Mistress shook her head, " This isn't courtesy, I would never be courteous to you, but I still wanted to say this to you. Apart from this, I couldn't think of anything else to say."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunset Palace Mistress didn't say anything else. After all, her most precious capital is herself. Yet, even though she was willing to give it to him, he wouldn't accept it. She knew he wasn't totally uninterested in her body, but he was restraining himself, or he didn't want to hurt her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That made her fall for him even more. She knew that if he was the kind of man who drooled at her beauty, even if he got her body, but he would never capture her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Women are precisely so contradictory. She had taken the initiative, but she now felt that this was the best ending. If he had happily accepted her confession at the very beginning, she wouldn't know if she'd still like him, or if she'd really given herself to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sunset Palace's strength isn’t bad, I'd bring you to Sea King Palace tomorrow and let you guys get acquainted with each other. Let's see what plans you'd have for the future. I hope you guys can make the best allies." Qing Shui said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, I will." Sunset Palace Mistress said joyfully.</span></p>

She knew what Qing Shui was thinking about and knew what she ought to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…...</span></p>

The next day, he went straight to the Divine Cave within the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two women saw Qing Shui bringing the Sunset Palace Mistress over, they seemingly understood something. If Qing Shui knew their thoughts, he would have switch to another method. Yet, this erroneous means actually caused the three women to get along in no time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Deep inside, she lamented this casanova for being such a womanizer. Yet she wasn't surprised since she was one of his women and she knew that this man was very lovable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of the women now knew each other's strengths, after all, their spiritual senses were strong, without much disparity. However, the current Yiye Jiange could stand up to the both of them. This was the extent of the gap between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Since you're now acquainted with each other, I get straight to the point. Everyone here is a &nbsp;friend. I hope that you can become best friends and the strongest of allies. In the future, whether you would be here or expanding into the Northern Ocean Domain, I hope that you can advance and retreat together. Of course, this is just a suggestion. What happens in the end depends on yourselves." Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, with Qing Shui’s suggestion, it was basically decided. It wasn’t because of Qing Shui's tyranny, but because he held unique places in each of their hearts, especially Yiye Jiange who regarded Qing Shui as her man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge had been rescued by Qing Shui once, and her current strength was also due to Qing Shui. The Sunset Palace Mistress’s situation was similar to Muyun Qingge as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">" I want to merge the Sunset Palace into the Sea King Palace, what do you think?" The Sunset Palace Mistress said after pondering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was deeply moved. This woman was very resolute. Her suggestion meant that she would give up her Sunset Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge shook her head, "We can merge, the name is just secondary. It's fine to name it Sunset Palace, Sea King Palace, or even Sunset Sea King Palace, it doesn't matter. How do we decide the ranking of the Palace Mistresses?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was very frank. Sunset Palace Mistress also knew that the Sea King Palace originally belonged to Muyun Qingge but now Yiye Jiange was the strongest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange smiled, "Sister Qingcheng shall be the First Palace Mistress, sister Qingge be the Second Palace Mistress, and I'd be the Third Palace Mistress, we’ll work together as one. We'd have a ceremony for our consolidation someday, what do you think?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We're sisters, these are just titles. We'd discuss with each other when things happen.” The Sunset Palace Mistress smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was delighted to see that their discussion had concluded. Presently they'd all become warriors of Divine grade, they had learned to accept many things. Because of Qing Shui, things went without a hitch. With him around, material possessions amounted to nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could naturally sense their feelings. Regardless of the reason behind it, they were at the very least from the bottom of the heart. Perhaps it came from accepting everything related to someone you love. In any case, the present relationship between the three women was very good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as they sincerely wanted to get along, they could be good friends. Furthermore, since their strengths, appearances, and statuses were similar, they already held each other at high regard, it made things even easier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days later, the Sunset Palace and Sea King Palace merged with a rather tacky name, Sunset Sea King Palace. The merger of Sea King Palace and Sunset Palace was quite smooth, with all their members elated about the merger..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At present, everyone knew that Sea King Palace was formidable, but lacked capable subordinates. With the merger, many capable experts from Sunset Palace felt that the opportunity had come for them to stand out from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The merger went very well. Since they merged, everything needed to fit in seamlessly. A new site at the most strategic location in &nbsp;the Ice Ocean Domain was chosen. This location wasn’t too far away from the Golden Sand Palace and was the nearest location to the Northern Ocean Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Cave was one of Qing Shui's designated spots. Even if the Divine Cave disappeared, Qing Shui would arrive here if he used the Five Elements Divine Flag. This spot was crucial as it was the fastest way for Qing Shui to go home and return here. After all, there still was an important location in Linhai city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three women were considered to have become formidable, while Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing were comparable in strength too, Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong were of adequate strength as well. However, they still had a long way to go before achieving the Divine grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moving was an extremely complex and burdensome matter. There were existing buildings at the new location. Yet, the whole process took around half a month to be completed. After completion, the chiefs of each group were gathered for a meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The positions of the three Mistresses were considered secure. There're three Sunset Sea King commanding badges and all of them equally signified the status of the Mistresses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's current position in the Sunset Sea King Palace was the one and only guardian. Qing Shui naturally wouldn't reject it. As a guardian, he also had a Sunset Sea King commanding badge too, possessing the power of a Palace Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were no objections from the subordinates and they were instead extremely happy. This was because Qing Shui was highly reputable and was their guardian. It's well-known that the guardian was usually stronger and more formidable than the Mistress and was the strongest existence around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People began guessing the relationship between Qing Shui and three stunning beauties. They knew one of them was Qing Shui's wife, who was also the one with the greatest strength. Some people naturally tried guessing who the other two were to Qing Shui with many versions being spread.</span></p>

As Qing Shui thought of the Heavenly Place and Hundred Miles City, a sense of nostalgia arose. He wanted to return to visit when he had time in the future. Emotional stirrings would happen when you visit a nostalgic place. In fact, everyone reminisced about the past and memories were beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was unexpected was that three days later, men from the Dragon King Palace appeared. When everyone had almost forgotten about them, the Dragon King Palace arrived. Such a huge event would originally not to be forgotten, but now that the Sunset Sea King Palace had gained four warriors of Divine grade, they were confident enough, thus many members of the Sunset Sea King Palace forgot about the matter regarding the Dragon King Palace.</span></p>

Anyone who tried to obstruct them suffered a crushing defeat, they lost tens of warriors.</span></p>

Since he was already part of the Sunset Sea King Palace, it's normal to be angry. Leading the Dragon King Palace members were three chiefs, who were Elementary Divine Grade, their strengths only around three hundred Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the situation, Qing Shui realized that when news of a well-known matter in a small region like the Ice Ocean Domain reached the Northern Ocean Domain, it's like a tiny village's matter that didn’t affect the ideology of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three leading men looked slightly older. When Qing Shui reached, he saw that men from the Sunset Sea King Palace were still being murdered mercilessly. In a burst of anger, he waved his hand, causing forty out of the fifty men to be eliminated.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who gave you the guts to cause trouble with the Sunset Sea King Palace," Qing Shui gave a cold look at the opponents.</span></p>

Qing Shui had wiped out their men without much effort and these men were all False God warriors, with more than half of them Peak False Gods. Of course, there were differences in strength among Peak False Gods.</span></p>

Let me ask you again, who ordered you to come?" Qing Shui's tone turned cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Regardless who asked us to come, you have to account for your actions," The purple-robed old man was unperturbed.</span></p>

The three old men had only moved slightly, while seven men behind them vomited blood as they flew backwards, unknown if they were still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was acting out of anger. He hated seeing the weak being massacred as that was relying on one’s strength to bully others. Seeing how the Golden Sand Palace were trash, Qing Shui reckoned that the Dragon King Palace weren’t honorable people as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is it the time now to tell me who ordered you to create trouble here," Qing Shui stared at the remaining three old men and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, you are strong, but destruction pursues the great. It'd be better to keep a low profile. It doesn't matter who asked us to come. What’s important is that you offended someone you can’t afford to offend.” the old man looked calm on the surface, but Qing Shui could see that he was feeble and susceptible on the inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, and made his move. This time, everyone could see Qing Shui’s tyrannical attack, his fist directly striking toward the old man on the right. A gigantic golden fist directly smashed toward that old man.</span></p>

Qing Shui had no plans to to let them off. Since they'd already here, then there's no need for them to return. Qing Shui wanted to let others know that they had to consider their own capabilities before coming to the Sunset Sea King Palace and cause trouble.</span></p>
