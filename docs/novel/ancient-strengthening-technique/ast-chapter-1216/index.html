 <p>AST 1216 - Nine Heavens Golden Pellet, Sacred Hall, Promotion to Elite Disciple</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange said that he would become a core disciple very soon. Additionally, this time around, the reason he came here was so that he could accumulate sufficient contribution. As for his cultivation level, Lord Sect's leader would give him a Nine Heavens Golden Pellet.</p>
 <p>"Nine Heavens Golden Pellet?" When Qing Shui heard this, he was very astonished.</p>
 <p>He could actually sense that Tian Jiange definitely had a close relationship with some people in the upper echelon in Lord Sect. He could tell that from the fact that these people he was with were stronger than him but were still very respectful toward him.</p>
 <p>"It's a type of mysterious medicinal pill which can increase one's strength by a lot and temporarily raises some things, like one's comprehension. It has a very long effect and not only would it provide a large increase in power, for a long period of time after, one's level of comprehension in martial techniques and skills would be several times faster than before."</p>
 <p>This was something subjective. The higher one's talent was, the stronger the effects of the Nine Heavens Golden Pellet.</p>
 <p>"This really is something good!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>There were many precious and rare treasures in the World of the Nine Continents. There were also countless items left behind from the ancient times. It was just that many of these things were hidden very well and one might only get them if they were lucky.</p>
 <p>This Nine Heavens Golden Pellet was said to be a powerful medicinal pill left behind from the ancient times.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Oh, right. Brother, are you interested in joining Lord Sect? We brothers can be together then. Lord Sect is not bad. At least, it isn't as arrogant as some other factions." Tian Jiange smiled and said. He was very straightforward.</p>
 <p>"To be honest, I've already joined Breezing Wind Veranda. If I hadn't, then I'd really want to join Brother." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"That's really a pity. But it's fine. Lord Sect and Breezing Wind Veranda are on very good terms. I heard that our leader likes Teacher Sunu a lot. We might even become a family in the future. In the future, if you are to come across any problems and need help, don't forget about me. I'll definitely help out if I can." Tian Jiange smiled and said very seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of what the Seventh Princess had said previously. There seemed to be a lot of people who liked the Eldest Princess. These people also restricted one another and even if they wanted to do anything to the Eldest Princess, they wouldn't be able to do so. Moreover, the Eldest Princess was supported by a powerful expert and no one dared to make any reckless moves.</p>
 <p>It seemed that Lord Sect was also one of such parties.</p>
 <p>The two of them chatted a lot and Qing Shui got to learn of quite a number of things. For example, although it wasn't clear what kind of characters the leaders of factions like the Saint Child Band and Lord Sect were like, but to be able to get over ten thousand people submit to them, must mean that they are all powerful experts. Therefore, there wasn't a need to guess. It was obvious that these were extremely talented individuals and in the future, one of them might even be the one to take over Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>Compared to aristocrat inheritance, the Heaven Secrets Academy was more inclined toward sects and the strongest person would be revered.</p>
 <p>This could also be why the Heaven Secrets Academy turned a blind eye toward the formation of these groups. Those people who were arrogant would probably just become the stepping stones of the ones who would truly lead the Heaven Secrets Academy. Some people were never meant to have great achievements. Even if they were to gain the upper hand, it would only be temporary.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange didn't stay on this topic for very long. He had always seen himself as very strong, and he felt that in the future, Qing Shui would definitely be very strong. This might be why he had agreed that they would be friends the next time they met when they had battled previously.</p>
 <p>Now they were considered friends. At least it was a good beginning!</p>
 <p>The other people who were with Tian Jiange didn't say much. A large group of demonic beasts had appeared in the distance and all of the people started killing the beasts. Qing Shui and the ladies used the Unison Swordplay.</p>
 <p>It was only now that some of them noticed Qing Shui's and the ladies' great teamwork. The great flow of their teamwork increased their prowess greatly, causing Tian Jiange’s group to be stunned. It was a very good feeling.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange also knew that Qing Shui wanted to advance to become a high grade disciple or even an elite disciple. However, it was impossible for one to advance to a core disciple in less than five years. Not even if one was strong enough.</p>
 <p>It might be because the people from the Saint Child Band they had met earlier were too arrogant that Qing Shui felt that the people from Lord Sect seemed different. At the very least, these people seemed stronger than those from Saint Child Band and they have better qualities as well.</p>
 <p>One would require a high level of contribution to advance to a core disciple. Tian Jiange had already accumulated merits for a very long period of time but it would still take him some more time. He would need to take the Nine Heavens Golden Pellet and then when he became strong enough, he would then be able to head to the Heaven Secrets Academy and be promoted to a core disciple.</p>
 <p>They stayed here and killed for three days. Qing Shui gained sufficient contribution level for him to be promoted to an elite disciple and he was preparing to return. The wave of beasts this time around was also close to its end. For the past three days, Qing Shui had seen many experts from the Heaven Secrets Academy appearing in the area. There were even more experts from Wavemoon Dynasty. There were no signs of the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>In three days, Qing Shui and Tian Jiange got closer. They had very similar characters and as the saying went, birds of the same feathers flock together. Only people who could get along well could be called friends. For the past few days, the two of them had gotten to know each other very well with and had started to address each other as brothers. Most importantly, it was the feeling that was calm as water between gentlemen. Other than the very start when Tian Jiange invited Qing Shui to join Lord Sect, he did not dwell on stuff relating to this area thereafter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the others left. During these few days, he didn't bring out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. It wasn't because he was scared, but rather, he felt that there wasn't a need for it. It was one of his killing attacks and he felt that it was better for it to remain concealed for now.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange still required a little bit more time, so Qing Shui and the others headed back first. Anyways, he had no method of being raised to a core disciple for now and there wasn't a need for him to get that high a contribution level. Moreover, it was still hard to say who would lead the Heaven Secrets Academy in the future.</p>
 <p>No one knew that he had killed that few hundreds of people from Saint Child Band. After returning to the Heaven Secrets Academy, no one discussed it either. This made Qing Shui feel that the people from Breezing Wind Veranda were still quite good. On that day, there were several tens of people from Breezing Wind Veranda.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't especially concerned that the people from Saint Child Band would get to know that he had killed their people. However, at present, he felt that it was still better not to let others know of it. After he got strong enough, these wouldn't matter anymore.</p>
 <p>Sacred Hall!</p>
 <p>This was the place where Heaven Secrets Academy checked on their members and promoted them. Every day, there would be quite a number of disciples rising up to high grade disciple from ordinary disciple, and from high grade disciple to elite disciple.</p>
 <p>There weren't many cases of elite disciples being raised to core disciples. Sometimes, one might be able to see one, or several but at other times, one might not even be able to see one even in 10 to 14 days.</p>
 <p>Today, there seemed to be a lot more people than usual. When there were large assignments, there would be more people here since it would be easier to gain the contribution level from the Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>Contribution wasn't something which could be purchased or gifted. Of course, one could gift items that could be exchanged for contribution. For example, in this assignment, people could gift you with Demon Nuclei and you could also kill others to snatch their Demon Nuclei.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui came alone. The girl was back in the manor. She wasn't allowed to wander around. Even though she was quite strong, she was after all, not a member of the Heaven Secrets Academy. Therefore, even if she was together with Qing Shui, there were still some areas she couldn't go. The Sacred Hall was one of them.</p>
 <p>They were in the front hall of the Sacred Hall. This was where the promotions of elite disciples or lower tiers were conducted. Only the promotion for core disciples would be conducted inside and it would be more stringent.</p>
 <p>"You want to be promoted from ordinary disciple to elite disciple?" An old man looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
 <p>The old man was very elegant and thin, and had a very eye-catching goatee. He appeared very amiable as he smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"That's right, Elder. May I ask what conditions I need to fulfill?" Qing Shui took out some Demon Nuclei. Through Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess, he had already known of the contribution level required for one to be promoted to an elite disciple.</p>
 <p>"This level of contribution is sufficient for one to be promoted to an elite disciple but I'll still have to test your abilities. That is the most important part. First, I’ll record these contributions under your name." The old man smiled and said. He then took the small pile of Demon Nuclei from Qing Shui and stored them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also knew that the contribution level before the core disciple level wasn't high. Most people would be able to gather enough but it was hard for them to gain enough powers to reach the required level.it was because the lowest elite disciple would need at least a strength of 10,000 nimbus.</p>
 <p>The test was a battle. It was very simple. One would be required to have at least a battle prowess of 10,000 nimbus. For Qing Shui, this was of course of no issue. He got through the administration very quickly and after he bid the old man goodbye, he met someone on the way out.</p>
 <p>Young Master Fu!</p>
 <p>It was the person called Young Master Fu. This man was handsome but cunning and he had wanted to lay his hands on the ladies, but he didn't end up taking any action. When he saw Qing Shui, he also wore a smirk. When the two of them passed by, a voice rang out.</p>
 <p>"You should consider my previous suggestion again!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, not saying anything. People like these were just like insignificant ants to him. Although Qing Shui wasn't especially strong, he had the potential to be strong. It was just that he still required a little opportunity, and that opportunity was nearing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard that this man was already a core disciple and would soon be taken in by Elder Tianyi as his disciple. If it was in the past, Qing Shui might find it to be a little troublesome since it wouldn't be good for him to be targeted by someone like this.</p>
 <p>Most elite disciples were no match for him—even more so in battles. Core disciples should be much stronger, especially the disciples some Elders had taken a liking to. They should be of a similar level to the Eldest Princess and even if they were weak, they shouldn't be underestimated.</p>
 <p>However, thinking of how he had his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, Qing Shui paid Young Master Fu no heed and left directly. The other party was blind to get involved with Qing Shui. If he didn't open his eyes, Qing Shui wouldn't mind killing him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held onto his new authority token and the other items that represented his identity. His manor had also changed to one that was three-story tall.</p>
 <p>Here, three-stories was just a concept. There wasn't actually three stories but more so that the height was on the third tier. It was at a height of over 100 meters and there were only two tiers below him. The manor of a core disciple would be at least over 1,000 meters. This was the distance between them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui brought the girl and moved to the new place. Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess came along too. There was a great difference here when compared to the small place they were staying at previously.</p>
 <p>The area was many times bigger. There was at least five Mu. Walking here, Qing Shui looked to the far distance and then upward. Above them, there were still many tiers of core disciples, teachers, Elders, and Custodians. It was even said that on the exterior, there were even existences which they weren't aware of.</p>
 <p>The boundlessly luxurious scene was like a mirage with mountains, waters, and dense forests. All of these belonged to Heaven Secrets Academy and it was just the exterior appearance. No one knew what the interior was like.</p>
 <p>To be able to have an extraordinary standing in the Western Oxhe Continent, the Heaven Secrets Academy must have some terrifying powers. Looking at the Heaven Secrets Academy, Qing Shui thought of the other two Grade Four Dynasties.</p>
 <p>Were there any Grade Five Dynasties in Western Oxhe Continent? Was there anyone in Heaven Secrets Academy and the other two Grade Four Dynasties who were Grade Five existences?</p>
 <p>What grade State Master was a False God?</p>
 <p>In that moment, Qing Shui went into a short daze. The path of martial arts was endless; there would always be someone stronger out there!</p>
