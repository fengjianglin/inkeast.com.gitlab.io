 <p><strong>AST 767 - Showdown, Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death Once Again&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>This time around, the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan had not only lost their reputation, but also failed to save Donggong Taiqing. The elder from the clan was so infuriated that he was on the verge of puking blood. Although he didn’t show any outward changes in his expression, the others from Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan were stunned.</p>
 <p>"Taiqing!"</p>
 <p>An elderly man suddenly shot up onto the arena and carried the body of Donggong Taiqing, who had fallen to a horrible death. Tear stricken, he glared at Qing Shui, who was landing nearby.</p>
 <p>"You must be Dongong Maisun. How do you feel now?" Qing Shui's calm voice rang out. The audience in the arena quieted down. They sensed that there was something unusual going on.</p>
 <p>"Lad, you've killed my grandson, I must kill you!" The old man glared at Qing Shui with bloodshot eyes and had a strong urge to go up right now and tear him into pieces. However, he couldn’t yet break the arena rules.</p>
 <p>"Haha, the people from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan can kill others as they wish, but others aren’t allowed to kill people from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan in the arena just to defend themselves?" Qing Shui laughed out loud without any restraint.</p>
 <p>"People from Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan massacre others as they wish?" Someone spoke out in astonishment.</p>
 <p>"What's so weird about it? Has there been any shortage of cases where people from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan killed people as they wish? What are you so shocked about? You're really ignorant." Someone immediately shot back and threw him a look of contempt.</p>
 <p>"Seems like this young man has a grudge with Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan and is now here to seek revenge." Someone gave the matter some thought and spoke his conclusion.</p>
 <p>"I think so too. Think about what he had said. It seems like the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan's past acts of killing as they wished impacted him somehow."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Who are you?" Donggong Maisun looked at Qing Shui. Although fury still clouded his eyes, there was also a hint of doubt. Of course, he had also sensed the meaning within Qing Shui's words.</p>
 <p>"It doesn't matter who I am. Do you remember the event from 60 years ago where you and a few others from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan forced an old man to beat his son to his death in Greencloud Continent?" Qing Shui asked calmly.</p>
 <p>Fei Wuji was already tear stricken. Because of Donggong Maisun, because of the people from Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan, he had become an orphan from a young age, and his grandfather had died full of regrets...</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. Only after seeing Fei Wuji in tears, did she truly understand that Qing Shui was trulyto seek revenge...</p>
 <p>The old man from the Ye Clan still appeared very calm but was actually paying attention to the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan's actions. After seeing the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable on Qing Shui's shoulder, his gaze, which could cause other people's hearts to stir, once again became extremely strange.</p>
 <p>"Who are you to him..."</p>
 <p>Donggong Maisun asked in astonishment, but regretted it the moment he said this. How could he admit he had done something like this in his past? He quickly followed, "What are you saying? I don't..."</p>
 <p>It was fine if he hadn't accidentally admitted his despicable past actions, but he regretted it once he did. He might have lost his grandson and he might be grieving, but Donggong Maisun had always thought that he was very intelligent. Now, he had made a mistake. To some extent, this had happened because he had disregarded Qing Shui, because of his own domineering character.</p>
 <p>"The tables have now turned. The people from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan are really inhuman. To think that they'd force someone to beat his own child to death. Is this something that a human would do?" There were many people who exacerbated the situation by calling out.</p>
 <p>"Seems like it’s time for retribution to fall on them. Someone with strength has come knocking on their door."</p>
 <p>"However, this young man is really foolish to want to challenge the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan all by himself." Someone looked at Qing Shui on the arena and towards the Ye Clan.</p>
 <p>"To think that the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan presented themselves as some great, reputable clan. Reputable clans own up to their own actions. This is really disappointing. It's clear to people whether you've done something despicable like this or not." Qing Shui smiled. It felt good to be the one taking initiative.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Back then, I made someone kill his own son. Who asked his son to molest my younger sister?" Donggong Maisun bellowed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, you're not a man. To think that you don't give a damn about your sister's reputation because you're scared that I’ll take revenge. What's done is done, why try to hide it? Do you think that anyone will believe what you say?" Qing Shui stared at Donggong Maisun, powering up his Nature Energy and throwing it towards him.</p>
 <p>What was wrong with him today? Why did he feel like trying to escape? Donggong Maisun didn't know that he had been affected by Qing Shui's Nature Energy from the very start.</p>
 <p>"Ha, that's right. I did push him to his death. So what about it? Today, I'm still going to kill you." Donggong Maisun suddenly bellowed out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had drawn back his Nature Energy and with the release of pressure, Donggong Maisun was like a tied up wild beast that had finally gained its freedom. His loud bellow could be heard by everyone in the area.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's goal was to let everyone know why he was here today and what the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan had done. This would justify his actions.</p>
 <p>Moreover, many people had suffered under the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan and their loud comments and jeers made the people from Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan feel guilty.</p>
 <p>In a battle, mental attacks would always have some effect.</p>
 <p>"Kill me? Alright. Today, I, Qing Shui, issue a challenge to the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan for a Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death." Qing Shui said calmly to Donggong Maisun, his voice heard by a number of listeners.</p>
 <p>His words caused ripples across the crowd like a rumble of thunder, causing everyone to be shocked. The Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death was a battle used between reputable clans and sects.</p>
 <p>However, he was now challenging the entire Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan by himself. How could this not astonish everyone? Many people thought that they had heard wrongly, but after seeing other people's reactions, they knew they had heard correctly.</p>
 <p>Donggong Maisun was astonished by Qing Shui's words and just stood there, unmoving. His brain wasn't even processing the situation anymore.</p>
 <p>"What a guy! He's too powerful! It's completely astonishing to be issuing a challenge to the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan for a Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death." Someone suddenly shouted out excitedly and commotion broke out in the area.</p>
 <p>"The surprises that this young man are giving really are coming one after another. Even I doubt that he can really accomplish what he’s claimed with that confidence of his." A young, tall lady said to an older married lady.</p>
 <p>"That's hard to say. Maybe this time around, you’ve guessed it correctly." The charming married lady smiled and said to the younger lady dotingly.</p>
 <p>The young lady looked at the married lady with her beautiful eyes before looking in shock at that young man on the arena. She then smiled and didn't say anything else.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya didn't say anything either, but inside, his blood was boiling. It was the same for Fei Wuji, but he ached over the fact that although it was his problem, Qing Shui was the one facing it alone.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan was now puzzled. She was stunned when Qing Shui issued the challenge for a Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death against the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan. What was he trying to do...</p>
 <p>"Why, does Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan not dare to pick up this challenge?" Qing Clan's laughing voice rang out again with a powerful penetrating force.</p>
 <p>"Of course our Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan will take you up on your challenge. You have been challenging the authority of our Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan. Throw us everything you have, we'll take them all head on." This time around, Donggong Maisun’s grandfather spoke, his voice clear and powerful.</p>
 <p>"Then that's fine. I'm leaving my life on the line. If I don't die, the one to die will be you guys." Qing Shui smiled and said to the old man from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan.</p>
 <p>"Young man, I admit that you're very outstanding, but you really haven’t seen much of the world yet. What you're saying is truly ridiculous and I expect that you're tired right now as well. How about we meet here tomorrow morning?" There was no grief reflected on the old man's face as he said this.</p>
 <p>"Grandfather, I want to kill him now!" Donggong Maisun said to the old man from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan, his eyes flushed red.</p>
 <p>"Shut up. Come back with me." The old man said calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui agreed. He was not afraid that the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan would come up with any new schemes, especially because the people here witnessed everything. He was considered the weaker side and the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan could theoretically bash him up openly. There was no need for them to do so in the dark. Otherwise, if news were to leak out, people would look down on them even more.</p>
 <p>Old Man Wuma had been watching the events unfold with great interest. However, when Qing Shui brought up the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death, his expression turned into one of radiance.</p>
 <p>Even OId Man Tantai, who had not been silent the whole time, took an extra look at Qing Shui before he turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui came down from the arena and sighed helplessly as he walked up to Ye Guyan. She seemed to be out of sorts, along with Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan looked at Qing Shui in a daze, not saying a word.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry." Qing Shui felt that he had lied to her in the past and apologized. He felt that he had done Ye Guyan wrong.</p>
 <p>"You didn't do me any wrong. It'll be fine if you can live with your decisions." Ye Guyan put up a forced smile and said.</p>
 <p>"Mister Qing, if you're free, please do drop by my Wuma Clan." Old Man Wuma smiled and said to Qing Shui when he passed by.</p>
 <p>"Oh, thank you. If I have the time, I'll definitely go." Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>Old Man Wuma left after this. Many people nodded to Qing Shui kindly and there were even a few who greeted him.</p>
 <p>When an old man and a young man walked up, the young man had his eyes fixed on Qing Shui. Qing Shui recognized him because his crimson red clothes stood out a lot.</p>
 <p>Qu Runie. This young man was Qu Runie. Seeing that Qing Shui was looking at him, he drew back his gaze and left with the old man. That day, if his grandfather had not called him back, he would’ve ended up in the same spot as Donggong Taiqing.</p>
 <p>"Let's go back first." The old man from the Ye Clan smiled and said. He walked as if nothing had changed and his expression was very calm.</p>
 <p>They walked toward the north direction under everyone's gaze and then left on the beast carriage. Only the old man Donggong remained and he only returned with the people from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan after Qing Shui and the others had disappeared.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, all the main characters in the fiasco had left. However, over 90 percent of the people remained, gathering in groups of different sizes heatedly discussing what had just occurred.</p>
 <p>They were guessing the results of the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death tomorrow, guessing who would be the winner, guessing what tricks Qing Shui had up his sleeves, and guessing how many people would come out from Qing Shui's side. In a Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death, each side could send out a maximum of 5 participants.</p>
 <p>It was noon when Qing Shui and the others arrived back at Ye Residence. The chefs had prepared the food and served them, but no one really had an appetite.</p>
