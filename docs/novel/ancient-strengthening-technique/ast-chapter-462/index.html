 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">

  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 462 Transformation, Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Monstrous Abilities</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">About an hour later, Qing Shui noticed that no one had come over! There were no demonic beasts either!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He thought about it for a little while before dismissing it. Who would be so foolish to seek out such a powerful beast roar? Would that not just be signing your own death certificate? Qing Shui thought about his own anxiety earlier and believed he was being too careful. But well, there were still those who were not afraid of death, so it would be better to exercise more caution.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had felt all along that that ball of Qi in his Dan Tian was already quite big to begin with, but it was still gradually increasing. However, the law of diminishing returns gradually set in. Qing Shui knew that the awakening of the Diamond Demonic Bear’s latent potential would be completed soon as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Diamond Demonic Boar that was in the bag. Inadvertently, its gleam had grown brighter, as if it was a large rainbow-colored egg. It had a length of ten meters, shining out colorful lights, and was an amazing sight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the growth of the ball of Qi in his Dan Tian had ceased. He could deduce it was now two times bigger than if he were to add up the sizes of the previous two times it grew.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had wanted to absorb it here, but eventually dismissed this thought. Qing Shui kept having the feeling that it was not safe to stay here for long, which was why he was waiting for the Diamond Demonic Boar to be fully awakened!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The colorful lights gradually faded, but the Diamond Demonic Boar that appeared before Qing Shui stunned him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was no longer the Diamond Demonic Boar it once was...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Its body was still golden-colored, giving off a semblance of the purest gold. Its body was over four meters long, its height over two meters. Qing Shui would probably not be able to touch its back even if he reached out with his hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even its width was about two meters. It was like a golden castle, very astonishing, and looked very strong. There would be no one who would say that it did not look nice. It was a beauty transcending the traditional views towards beauty.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw the face of the Diamond Demonic Boar, he was stunned once again!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That nose, which was about his height...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ears about one meter...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of the image that appeared in the elephant form in his consciousness, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, and looked towards the Diamond Demonic Boar before him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Was this not the Diamond Gigantic Elephant that could fly, dig into the ground, and go into the water, just a few times smaller in size?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Diamond Gigantic Elephant?" Qing Shui looked helplessly towards the Diamond Demonic Boar, which had spontaneously grown many times in size!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The fully awakened Diamond Demonic Boar, or rather, Diamond Gigantic Elephant, ran joyfully towards Qing Shui. It laid down on the floor, rubbing against Qing Shui affectionately. Even if it was on the ground, it was in no way shorter than Qing Shui. Although its height was slightly over two meters, with those thick limbs supporting that tremendous body, even if it laid down on the ground, it would still be at about Qing Shui's height!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hahaha..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly broke into hysterical laughter, to the extent that tears were gathering in his eyes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">To think that the awakened Diamond Demonic Boar would evolve into a Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">To think that a boar would have the blood of an elephant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had heard about this before. In his previous life, Qing Shui had heard about some weird news, one of which was about a female pig giving birth to an elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was said that that female pig had given birth to 13 piglets. One of these piglets refused to eat anything, nor was it afraid of strangers. It was very active, with ears much bigger than an average piglet, and its nose was also longer. It looked very cute, but it was a pity that it died only after half a day. However, someone from the Zoological Society had passed by. And after bringing it back for examinations, they found out that it had the genes of elephants...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui reached out his hand to pat the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's big head, smiling in satisfaction!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A Diamond Gigantic Elephant equal to a grade 9 Martial King!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even after it had taken 5 Beast Pills, it had only managed to reach the level of grade 2 Martial King. But after its talent had awakened, or rather, after its bloodline had awakened, it was a evolution of the bloodline, allowing it to soar up to become a grade 9 Martial King.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A Diamond Gigantic Elephant that had the strength of a grade 9 Martial King!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui could not help but feel jealous. It was because he had sensed the Diamond Demonic Boar's abilities.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Resistance to strength of four countries worth!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Attacking powers of two countries worth!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a diamond, an unbreakable diamond!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the ninth grade of a Martial King.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of how he was going to venture into the Flowerfruit Mountain. He had never thought that the Diamond Demonic Boar had directly evolved into a Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He was just unsure if it had fully comprehended the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's abilities yet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just the thought of this made him a bit excited!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He used his Spiritual Sense to call out to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui discovered that his connection with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was closer than before. It might be because of the constant feedback of energy from it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a flash, Qing Shui suddenly saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's abilities!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were exactly the same as the supporting techniques Qing Shui had seen in his consciousness in the past! He could see the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's ability!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With one look, Qing Shui was brimming with immense surprise and joy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The first one Qing Shui saw was Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's passive technique. No need to intentionally activate. Increases attacking powers by onefold! Cannot level up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Protection: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's passive technique. Increases one's defence by onefold! Cannot level up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Dash: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's passive technique. No need to intentionally activate. Increases running speed by onefold! Cannot level up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's active technique. Requires Core Qi from the Core! The tremendous mighty elephant can stomp fiercely on the ground; with a loud bellow, its aura and strength can be enhanced. When on the ground, it can bring out two times its original strength. Can level up!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's active technique. Requires Core Qi from the Core! During collisions, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's attacking powers can be increased by 50%, not stackable with Diamond Qi. Can level up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Reading on, Qing Shui saw that everything else was in grey, undisplayed. However, he knew that these skills could be attained in the future. As the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation level increases, its comprehension and level in these techniques would increase. After all, they were all the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's skills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but feel jealous. The good thing was that this was his own demonic beast. Just the Diamond Qi alone could increase the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's strength by onefold when his own strength was only increased by 50%. This was even after he had dedicated long hours into his training. And if he did not have the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would not even be able to achieve this!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Diamond Qi was a passive technique and would automatically provide enhancement when it attacks, runs or moves. It would also not deplete its Core Qi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Offensive ability of 2 countries worth. It had increased by onefold right off the bat, joining among the ranks of strong warriors in the Greencloud Continent. It was a pity that it only increased the offensive might, but that alone was monstrous enough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Protection. Qing Shui wanted to laugh when he saw this. It increased the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's defence by onefold just like that. A resistance to attacks of 8 countries worth would allow him to do whatever he wishes in the Greencloud Continent. However, that might not be applicable if they were to come into contact with other unknown demonic beasts. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s level was only at the Peak Martial King level amongst demonic beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, the progress of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was tremendous. Moreover, it was only at grade 9 Martial King at present. There were still plenty of room for improvement!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Its Mighty Elephant Stomp was also the same as his. In fact, the other things were also almost the same. This let Qing Shui understand that the elephant form he was learning was still very powerful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness increased its attack powers by 500%. It was not stackable with its Diamond Qi and could be leveled up. Take now for example, the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness could increase the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's strength of one country. When it displayed the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness, its strength could be increased to 5 countries worth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was also the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's strongest attack at the moment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What made Qing Shui most jealous was its defence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The ability to resist against 8 countries worth of raw damage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just the thought of it made Qing Shui feel that it was truly inconceivable. Although it was under the enhancement of the Diamond Protection, what was most important was that the Diamond Protection was a passive technique. Passive techniques would yield nigh-exponential results as the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation level increases. This was how terrifying passive techniques were.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly put his evolved Diamond Gigantic Elephant into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and followed suit. When the Fire Bird saw Qing Shui, it cried out happily. But when it saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, it was obviously on guard against it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thankfully, Qing Shui was there and they did not engage in battle. The Fire Bird was not a match for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, but the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could not fly and therefore not do anything to it either.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called for the Fire Bird and dashed out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal after getting on.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He went back to his room without saying a word. Looking at the time, Qing Shui knew that he would not be able to sleep anymore. He washed up and then took out the treasure map of the Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the beast parchment used to make the treasure map stemmed from a Martial Saint level demonic beast. Looking at the size of it, Qing Shui planned to use it for talisman drawing after getting his hands on the treasure.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The effects of the talismans should be better if a Martial Saint level demonic beast's' hide is used!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at this treasure map. He was set on the location, Flowerfruit Mountain. It was one of the most dangerous places in Greencloud Continent, and although not comparable to the Giant Beasts Mountains, it was listed among the top three most dangerous places in Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After taking a look for a while, Qing Shui took out the second treasure map.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a vast world. Qing Shui looked at the drawing on the treasure map and inferred that the skill of the artist was by no means inferior to the Art Maestro, especially in the grasp he had of setting up such striking, natural sceneries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The map was really lifelike, and there was a wide river in the drawing. The splattering waves from the river conveyed unbridled hostility. One side of the riverbank was a flat land. An endless, vast land.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The setting sun hung on the horizon in the west. Judging from the flow of the waves, Qing Shui could tell that the river flowed from the south to the north.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mountains lay in the east side. Qing Shui could tell that the mountains were very tall, as if they had pierced through the clouds. Most importantly, the rocks were red-colored. This made Qing Shui beside himself with joy. He could tell that there were clusters of flames all over the mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the flatland in the west, there was a forest with the semblance of a spreading fire. The trees were not especially tall or flourishing but looked more like a host of withering trees. Qing Shui could feel from the drawing that these sparse trees were brimming with vitality.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What place is this? Flaming mountains and crimson red trees?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a very long look at it but could not figure out where the place was. It seemed like he could only ask other people in the future where such places were located. By right, there should not be many places like this, which would narrow down the search.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was just that Qing Shui could not tell where the treasure in this treasure map was located. In the river? In the mountain? Or was it in the forests?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave up on it after thinking about it for a while. It had also started to get cold. Qing Shui walked out. Another wonderful day had arrived! He walked towards the square.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The fully awakened Diamond Demonic Boar, or rather, Diamond Gigantic Elephant, ran joyfully towards Qing Shui. It laid down on the floor, rubbing against Qing Shui affectionately. Even if it was on the ground, it was in no way shorter than Qing Shui. Although its height was slightly over two meters, with those thick limbs supporting that tremendous body, even if it laid down on the ground, it would still be at about Qing Shui's height!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Hahaha..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly broke into hysterical laughter, to the extent that tears were gathering in his eyes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">To think that the awakened Diamond Demonic Boar would evolve into a Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">To think that a boar would have the blood of an elephant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had heard about this before. In his previous life, Qing Shui had heard about some weird news, one of which was about a female pig giving birth to an elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was said that that female pig had given birth to 13 piglets. One of these piglets refused to eat anything, nor was it afraid of strangers. It was very active, with ears much bigger than an average piglet, and its nose was also longer. It looked very cute, but it was a pity that it died only after half a day. However, someone from the Zoological Society had passed by. And after bringing it back for examinations, they found out that it had the genes of elephants...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui reached out his hand to pat the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's big head, smiling in satisfaction!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A Diamond Gigantic Elephant equal to a grade 9 Martial King!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even after it had taken 5 Beast Pills, it had only managed to reach the level of grade 2 Martial King. But after its talent had awakened, or rather, after its bloodline had awakened, it was a evolution of the bloodline, allowing it to soar up to become a grade 9 Martial King.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A Diamond Gigantic Elephant that had the strength of a grade 9 Martial King!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui could not help but feel jealous. It was because he had sensed the Diamond Demonic Boar's abilities.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Resistance to strength of four countries worth!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Attacking powers of two countries worth!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a diamond, an unbreakable diamond!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the ninth grade of a Martial King.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought of how he was going to venture into the Flowerfruit Mountain. He had never thought that the Diamond Demonic Boar had directly evolved into a Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He was just unsure if it had fully comprehended the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's abilities yet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just the thought of this made him a bit excited!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He used his Spiritual Sense to call out to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui discovered that his connection with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was closer than before. It might be because of the constant feedback of energy from it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a flash, Qing Shui suddenly saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's abilities!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were exactly the same as the supporting techniques Qing Shui had seen in his consciousness in the past! He could see the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's ability!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With one look, Qing Shui was brimming with immense surprise and joy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The first one Qing Shui saw was Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's passive technique. No need to intentionally activate. Increases attacking powers by onefold! Cannot level up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Protection: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's passive technique. Increases one's defence by onefold! Cannot level up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Dash: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's passive technique. No need to intentionally activate. Increases running speed by onefold! Cannot level up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's active technique. Requires Core Qi from the Core! The tremendous mighty elephant can stomp fiercely on the ground; with a loud bellow, its aura and strength can be enhanced. When on the ground, it can bring out two times its original strength. Can level up!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness: Diamond Gigantic Elephant's active technique. Requires Core Qi from the Core! During collisions, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's attacking powers can be increased by 50%, not stackable with Diamond Qi. Can level up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Reading on, Qing Shui saw that everything else was in grey, undisplayed. However, he knew that these skills could be attained in the future. As the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation level increases, its comprehension and level in these techniques would increase. After all, they were all the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's skills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but feel jealous. The good thing was that this was his own demonic beast. Just the Diamond Qi alone could increase the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's strength by onefold when his own strength was only increased by 50%. This was even after he had dedicated long hours into his training. And if he did not have the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would not even be able to achieve this!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Diamond Qi was a passive technique and would automatically provide enhancement when it attacks, runs or moves. It would also not deplete its Core Qi.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Offensive ability of 2 countries worth. It had increased by onefold right off the bat, joining among the ranks of strong warriors in the Greencloud Continent. It was a pity that it only increased the offensive might, but that alone was monstrous enough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Protection. Qing Shui wanted to laugh when he saw this. It increased the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's defence by onefold just like that. A resistance to attacks of 8 countries worth would allow him to do whatever he wishes in the Greencloud Continent. However, that might not be applicable if they were to come into contact with other unknown demonic beasts. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s level was only at the Peak Martial King level amongst demonic beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, the progress of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was tremendous. Moreover, it was only at grade 9 Martial King at present. There were still plenty of room for improvement!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Its Mighty Elephant Stomp was also the same as his. In fact, the other things were also almost the same. This let Qing Shui understand that the elephant form he was learning was still very powerful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness increased its attack powers by 500%. It was not stackable with its Diamond Qi and could be leveled up. Take now for example, the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness could increase the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's strength of one country. When it displayed the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness, its strength could be increased to 5 countries worth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was also the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's strongest attack at the moment!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What made Qing Shui most jealous was its defence!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The ability to resist against 8 countries worth of raw damage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just the thought of it made Qing Shui feel that it was truly inconceivable. Although it was under the enhancement of the Diamond Protection, what was most important was that the Diamond Protection was a passive technique. Passive techniques would yield nigh-exponential results as the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's cultivation level increases. This was how terrifying passive techniques were.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly put his evolved Diamond Gigantic Elephant into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and followed suit. When the Fire Bird saw Qing Shui, it cried out happily. But when it saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, it was obviously on guard against it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thankfully, Qing Shui was there and they did not engage in battle. The Fire Bird was not a match for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, but the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could not fly and therefore not do anything to it either.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called for the Fire Bird and dashed out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal after getting on.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He went back to his room without saying a word. Looking at the time, Qing Shui knew that he would not be able to sleep anymore. He washed up and then took out the treasure map of the Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the beast parchment used to make the treasure map stemmed from a Martial Saint level demonic beast. Looking at the size of it, Qing Shui planned to use it for talisman drawing after getting his hands on the treasure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The effects of the talismans should be better if a Martial Saint level demonic beast's' hide is used!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at this treasure map. He was set on the location, Flowerfruit Mountain. It was one of the most dangerous places in Greencloud Continent, and although not comparable to the Giant Beasts Mountains, it was listed among the top three most dangerous places in Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After taking a look for a while, Qing Shui took out the second treasure map.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a vast world. Qing Shui looked at the drawing on the treasure map and inferred that the skill of the artist was by no means inferior to the Art Maestro, especially in the grasp he had of setting up such striking, natural sceneries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The map was really lifelike, and there was a wide river in the drawing. The splattering waves from the river conveyed unbridled hostility. One side of the riverbank was a flat land. An endless, vast land.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The setting sun hung on the horizon in the west. Judging from the flow of the waves, Qing Shui could tell that the river flowed from the south to the north.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mountains lay in the east side. Qing Shui could tell that the mountains were very tall, as if they had pierced through the clouds. Most importantly, the rocks were red-colored. This made Qing Shui beside himself with joy. He could tell that there were clusters of flames all over the mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the flatland in the west, there was a forest with the semblance of a spreading fire. The trees were not especially tall or flourishing but looked more like a host of withering trees. Qing Shui could feel from the drawing that these sparse trees were brimming with vitality.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What place is this? Flaming mountains and crimson red trees?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a very long look at it but could not figure out where the place was. It seemed like he could only ask other people in the future where such places were located. By right, there should not be many places like this, which would narrow down the search.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was just that Qing Shui could not tell where the treasure in this treasure map was located. In the river? In the mountain? Or was it in the forests?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave up on it after thinking about it for a while. It had also started to get cold. Qing Shui walked out. Another wonderful day had arrived! He walked towards the square.</p>
