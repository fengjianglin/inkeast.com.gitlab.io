 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0057 – Endless flirtation, asking for an yard after obtaining an inch</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was extremely joyful at this moment, as he got bolder and bolder. If it was under normal circumstances, he would definitely wouldn’t have dared to utter such words, constantly verbally taking advantage of Shi Qing Zhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Upon hearing Qing Shui’s constant smooth talk, Shi Qing Zhuang felt very bizarre. She was the youngest among her family, and was the only female child. As such, she was the shining pearl of the Shi Clan, and was showered with love and affection from a child till now.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Because of her cold and aloof nature, even when she was younger, children around her had never once called her elder sister. This was the first time she was called elder sister by albeit, a younger guy than her, but that guy could also already be considered an adult! Such a sensation was truly new to her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You better stop talking so glibly! I have yet to seek you out for revenge for what you did to my second brother!” Shi Qing Zhuang got more and more flustered, this guy was obviously taking advantage of her verbally, and yet, she did not feel the slightest bit of anger. Instead of anger, she even felt the urge to laugh. This was not her, this had never happened before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>That pretty pout in embarrassment by Shi Qing Zhuang electrocuted Qing Shui. Slack-jawed, he stored it deep inside his memory. Keeping his silence, he continued stealing glances at Shi Qing Zhuang. That cold beauty of hers was unique and extremely attractive to him. Qing Shui was unsure if it was precisely her aloof nature that make Shi Qing Zhuang so appealing, after all, all men want things they cannot obtain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Although your current strength is sufficient to defeat that bunch of young masters earlier, you have to beware of future retaliation. After all, even though these members of the various great clans were not the cream of the crop, to citizens of Hundred Miles City, defeating all of them in a single go is equivalent to destroying their “face” and pride. I dare say that there will be many challengers looking out and causing trouble for you, for the sake of regaining their “face” again.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After pondering for a moment, Qing Shui couldn’t help but agree that this was troublesome indeed. If in the future, there were constant challengers pointing their swords at him, demanding a challenge, how would he have the time to pull out the weeds one by one. Although before that ruckus he caused, Qing Shui had already briefly thought about this, it seems that he had severely underestimate the implications. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Elder sis, do you know, among the great clans, who has the strongest cultivation levels amongst the younger generations over here at Hundred Miles City?” Qing Shui knew that if his opponents wanted to regain their “face”, they would surely send their strongest in their younger generation to challenge him repeatedly. If he knew their strength, when he faced them, he could at least be prepared for it.</span></p>
  <p><span style> “You are pretty optimistic, to think that you could even ask this sort of question, seems like you are really confident. However, I have to say that your strength is really beyond expectations. Looking at how young you are, I wonder how even trained to achieve your current level of strength. To answer your original question, there are two opponents you have to watch out for. Situ Luan from the Situ Clan, and Ding Lang from the Ding Clan. They are both amongst the 3rd generation, and they are about 30+ in age, as well as both of them having already broken through to the 2nd and 3rd Grade of Martial Commander.” Qing Shi Zhuang replied, as the slightest trace of worry could be heard in her tone.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Qing Zhuang felt that the number of times she laughed today, had already far exceeded the total number of times she had laughed in 1 year. She too, could not help but to surreptitiously steal glances at this man in front of her, even though he was barely just a man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Qing Shui obtained the information from Shi Qing Zhuang, he finally let out a sigh of relief. Thank God, the cultivation of the strongest among the 3rd generations was still within his expectations. The 2nd generation genius, Qing He of the Qing Clan, had similar level of strength during his 30s as well. Without knowing why, Qing Shui unconsciously felt that currently, he was capable of clashing directly with opponents who were at the 2nd and 3rd grade of the Martial Commander Realm.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Thank you for your information, you know what, elder sis, you should smile more in the future. You are like a blooming rose, you look so dazzling when you smile, there is no exaggeration when I say that your beauty is even capable of causing kings to forfeit their empires.” Qing Shui continued teasing Shi Qing Zhuang, as the reddish tinge on Shi Qing Zhuang’s face got more and more rosy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Little brat, do you want to get beaten up!” After saying that, Shi Qing Zhuang extended her fist, and gently knocked it against Qing Shui’s shoulder while furiously blushing. This was the first time she had executed such a gesture comparable to a little girl.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui kept smiling like an idiot, as he happily allowed Qing Shi Zhuang to knock him down. There wasn’t even any sensation of pain, all he could think about was Shi Qing Zhuang blushing, and that dazzling smile of hers, which had already been firmly embedded in his mind. There were two types of women that could make a man happy. First, an incomparably ravishing beauty, that was capable of toppling kingdoms. Second, adorable women. A woman was beautiful because of how cute she was to you. Shi Qing Zhuang obviously belonged to the first category, if she could just act a little more adorably, then there was no doubt that she would drive men everywhere mad.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Anyway, I’m already an adult and no longer a child, so you must remember to treat me like an adult alright.” Seriousness was apparent in his eyes, as he said to Shi Qing Zhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>All men in their lifetime, would probably have flirted before with the opposite s*x. The main point was that even though you could ask for an yard after obtaining an inch, you must know when to stop. If it was too overly done, the girl would only feel turn off and be driven away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Okay, I have to leave now, you better take care of yourself, little adult!” A light laughter rang out as Shi Qing Zhuang was leaving. The sound of that laughter was akin to a demonic charm, constantly revolving around his brain, unable to dissipate.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So beautiful, you are going to be mine in the future!” Qing Shui only had this thought at this moment. He had never wanted anything so much before. So this was what people called “Longing”, and “Desire”.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were many types of longings and desires, including: riches, power, women. They could be a source of motivation, but if one was controlled by their desires, then they would only end up in a pitiable situation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you are free, you could always come to visit me at the Qing Clan’s Medical Store, I will be sure to make you happy.” Qing Shui called out after Shi Qing Zhuang’s retreating figure. Despite the few short moments he spent with her, he had never felt so blissful before in his life, and there was no telling when would their next meet up be. As such, Qing Shui was reluctant to let Shi Qing Zhuang leave just like this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Maybe Shi Qing Zhuang could hear the sincerity in Qing Shui’s voice, she unexpectedly nodded her head before she left. That beautiful back view of hers could be compared to butterflies fluttering about among the flowers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With a spring in his step, Qing Shui decided to return back to the Qing Clan’s Medical Store. Unknowingly, it was already noon. As he returned back the store, to his surprise, he found Qing Yi, his 3rd uncle and aunty, Qing Shan and Qing Shi all waiting for him, gazing at him with a strange light in their eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, did you really use the sword forms from the &lt;&lt;Basic Sword Techniques&gt;&gt; to defeat Situ Bu Fan and his cronies?”</span></p>
