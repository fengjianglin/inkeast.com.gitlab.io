 <p><strong>Chapter 336 Misty Hall Palace Mistress, she is the woman in the portrait of beauty?.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 336 - Misty Hall Palace Mistress, she is the woman in the portrait of beauty?</strong></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui estimated from the huge amount of plum flowers that he had used for the brewery that it would be enough for one whole cauldron. The cauldron was about the size of an adult’s head and it was about 20 jin (10 kg) heavy. </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui took out a goblet, and used a special bronze ladle to pour the wine into it. The goblet had three stands at the bottom, and appeared delicate and beautiful.</span></p>
  <p><span>After he looked at it, Qing Shui took a sip. That sudden mouth-watering sensation and the sense of freshness rushed through his forehead and went through the soles of his feet. Qing Shui was stunned by how relaxed his whole body now felt. It was like the moment when a man and a woman made love, the description ‘extremely comfortable’ couldn’t even begin to describe it.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui was amazed at the result from drinking the plum flower wine. How great he felt made Qing Shui realize that it might be even better than taking drugs, and it didn’t have the feeling of dejection when the drug was taken.</span></p>
  <p><span>As Qing Shui had already felt the results of drinking the plum flower wine, didn’t only have the sweet fragrance and wonderful sensation because of the wine, but it was also ultimately because of the plum flower!</span></p>
  <p><span>These </span><span>extraordinary plum flowers, in addition to the special methods of brew, were unexpectedly dewy, and had the effect of cleansing one’s impurities. Although the effect was small, it was very obvious. Most importantly, Qing Shui would be able to consume it long term.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui gulped down the remaining plum flower wine like he was drinking a delicious nectar in one go. He closed his eyes to feel that wondrous sensation once more. </span></p>
  <p><span>After that, he practiced until he was kicked out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
  <p><span>It was already late into the night when he finally stepped out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. When he exited he saw a portrait of a beauty. At that moment, he was involuntarily reminded of what happened back then in his dream.</span></p>
  <p><span>It was at that time when his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal &nbsp;upgraded to the 5th layer, and an Energy Fruit had appeared.</span></p>
  <p><span>And also, the Beauty Fruit caused him to be able to quickly refined the Beauty Pellet, in addition to the fact that he also unexpectedly broke through the barrier the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. All of this happened because of that woman.</span></p>
  <p><span>The reason was because he had ‘sneak attacked’ her towering peaks.</span></p>
  <p><span>At that moment, Qing Shui went insane as he recalled the marvelous feeling from that one touch. He couldn’t resist sinking into those wonderful memories.</span></p>
  <p><span>But Qing Shui could never know that every time he thought of it, he was actually subconsciously hurting that woman.</span></p>
  <p><span>………...</span></p>
  <p><span>At the highest peak of the Misty Hall!</span></p>
  <p><span>The enchanting woman sat up from the immortal bed because she could feel her soft bosoms being fondled by an invisible hand.</span></p>
  <p><span>“That bastard!” The woman frowned as she woke up.</span></p>
  <p><span>She had been woken up like this numerous times. Ever since she appeared in that strange dream, this kind of situation had happened to her at least once a day or more.</span></p>
  <p><span>She didn’t know why, but she did not like this feeling. She even suspected that she might be hallucinating, but she knew deep down it was all real. The dream that happened within the sea of flowers had created a connection to that man with herself.</span></p>
  <p><span>There was a faint blush on the woman’s beautiful face, and her beauty had a hint of smokiness under the moonlight. Qing Shui would definitely exclaim how similar she was to Yiye Jiange if he saw that unearthly aura she had.</span></p>
  <p><span>This woman’s face was shockingly similar to Canghai Mingyue, and her aura was a combination of both Canghai Mingyue and Yiye Jiange. </span></p>
  <p><span>Suddenly that ‘irritating’ feeling came again, and she couldn’t do anything to stop it. That invisible hand kept on fondling her soft bosom.</span></p>
  <p><span>“If you keep on doing this I will kill you!” The woman shouted out in her heart angrily and bashfully. This vented at him in a kind of compelled resistance.</span></p>
  <p><span>This woman was actually the Misty Hall Palace Mistress!</span></p>
  <p><span>But at this moment, Qing Shui who was immersed in that wonderful feeling was woken up abruptly, like he was met with a loud call from a general!</span></p>
  <p><span>“That was weird, I thought I heard her talking!” Qing Shui was bewildered as he thought about what has happened just now. Although it was the first time he heard this kind of voice, he was certain that this voice belonged to the woman he met in the erotic dream.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Is it you, I can hear what you just said, were you talking to me?” Qing just talked to himself inside the room.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Are you still there?”</span></p>
  <p><span>“.....”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui called out from the room like a lunatic, but in the end, he couldn’t hear anything from her. He didn’t know why, but he felt a bit disappointed.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui really wanted to thank the woman who had “lent” him a “big help”. But it was a shame that he didn’t know if she existed in the world of nine continents. </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui suddenly thought of the “Spiritual sense interaction”. He thought that she might have used her spirit energy to spread her spiritual sense across a definite area as a method to yell at him.</span></p>
  <p><span>This method would require a very high actual strength, especially strength in one’s spirit energy!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui had surpassed the 5th layer of the realm, and had consumed two energy fruits beforehand, so his current spirit energy was much stronger than it was before.</span></p>
  <p><span>He spread his spiritual sense as far as possible, even Yan Ling ‘er who was currently on her bed appeared inside his spiritual sense. Moreover, there was a faint glow of a size of a fist around the hazy figure of Yan Ling’ er.</span></p>
  <p><span>After that, Qing Shui could see a few with the same faint glow. Just then, he understood that the area covered by his spiritual sense had expanded, as well as being able to check the strength of the “flame of life” inside a person’s body to sense their level of cultivation through the spiritual sense.</span></p>
  <p><span>He expanded his spiritual sense, although the distance he covered was not more than 10 metres after his breakthrough, he could expand further into the surroundings. After all, that was the rumoured ability of a saint. There were numerous hazy “flames of life” that appeared inside his spiritual sense, and their strengths were different from each other.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui suddenly felt that his spiritual sense was deliberately touched by something. That was a weird feeling, and he felt uncomfortable from it.</span></p>
  <p><span>This must what it is like to be spied on by other people. This must be the feeling of being found out and spied upon!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui shrunk back his spiritual sense and laid on the bed. He noticed this it was his first time he didn’t want to sleep. He didn’t know why, but he suddenly had a pressing need to go home.</span></p>
  <p><span>On the other hand, the Misty Hall Palace Mistress was absent-minded as her expression turned strange.</span></p>
  <p><span>“He is at the Heavenly Palace after all, and I could even feel his presence inside his own spiritual sense!”</span></p>
  <p><span>She thought over and over again, then she got up and put on her clothes. It was already late at night, but she didn’t care. It has been days since she could touch that familiar spiritual sense, moreover in the real realm.</span></p>
  <p><span>She thought the world of the nine continents was vast, she wondered who that man she met in the sea of flower’s dream was.</span></p>
  <p><span>She didn’t want to know, and she knew it was impossible to meet him. But she could never think that all of these would happen because of that mysterious portrait of beauty that bound them together, and that was how the mysterious dream happened. Moreover, the portrait allowed both of them to have a mysterious connection with each other. Because Qing Shui was in possession of the portrait of beauty, the Misty Hall Palace Mistress could only be a good girl and be fondled with no way to resist it.</span></p>
  <p><span>She put on her silver clothes and walked outside. If she use her spiritual sense, she could never go wrong! She could accurately find where Qing Shui was situated, so she decided to go and check where he is. She could not stand him slowly killing her from the inside, so this was the only way to redeem her old self.</span></p>
  <p><span>Just when Qing Shui started to dazedly fall asleep, he felt a strong aura approach. The reason Qing Shui was able to feel it was because of the familiar aura.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Hmm, is it that aura who just spied on me?” Qing Shui felt the chills to his bones, because he felt that the aura was much more stronger than his own. This was also because her “flame of life” is especially brighter than anyone else’s. The brightness was as bright as a moon, and it was stronger than those weak flames of life he had seen before.</span></p>
  <p><span>“A woman?”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui could tell that it is a woman from the hazy figure approaching. Moreover, it was a woman with a beautiful figure.</span></p>
  <p><span>“A woman with such background and such wonderful figure, who could it be?” Qing Shui randomly guessed.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Knock knock knock!”</span></p>
  <p><span>A soft knock on the door! It sounded more bold in this lonely quiet night.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui was at loss now, he knew that when a woman knocked on his door, two things may happen. One, was to have an affair with him, the other, was to come for “debt”.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui felt that the chance of an affair was little. After all, a strong woman came to find him by herself!</span></p>
  <p><span>Was she a person who looked to ask for repayment of debt? Qing Shui thought that there weren’t many who would do that. The Song Family, a bunch of families who were horribly beaten by him, or possibly the Xi Family, or maybe an assassin from Sword Tower...</span></p>
  <p><span>As he thought about it, he realized he has offended quite a lot of people. It seemed that a lot of people are after his life!</span></p>
  <p><span>“Knock knock knock!”</span></p>
  <p><span>The door knocking came back!</span></p>
  <p><span>The skilled should be bold. Qing Shui wasn’t scared. As he thought about it, he got up and wore his pajamas and walked to the door. But he didn’t open it!</span></p>
  <p><span>“Who is it?” Qing Shui felt it was necessary to ask that question.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Me.” A simple word. Her voice was magnetic, with a bit of maturity. Just a single word has already brought great pleasure to him.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Who are you?” Qing Shui smiled as he asked again.</span></p>
  <p><span>“If you open the door, then you will know. Are you still afraid that I will make a move on you? If I wanted to, do you think this door would hold me down?” The woman spoke out, and Qing Shui is enjoying this especially.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui gathered up all his might in his body, but he kept holding it in. He opened the door slowly, and froze when he took the first glance. All his defenses were thrown away.</span></p>
  <p><span>What peered into Qing Shui’s eyes was a woman who wore a veil with a full body in silver clothes. She only revealed a pair of beautiful eyes, and they were profound, but serene. It was unusual, but it wasn’t that bad. Her eyes were otherworldly, but they never lost its vastness. Too bad her gaze was of a chilly indifference.</span></p>
  <p><span>This time, Qing Shui was stupefied by that cold gaze. He had never seen such beautiful eyes!</span></p>
  <p><span>Yiye Jiange was otherworldly, Canghai Mingyue magnificent and exceedingly beautiful, Shi QingZhuang was cold, but the woman in front of him is a combination of all three of them. Those beautiful eyes were a perfect combination of all these auras, and they were enough to charm anyone.</span></p>
  <p><span>That woman from the portrait of beauty was standing right in front of Qing Shui. Although her face was covered by a veil, he could see the outline of her beautiful face. But those revealing eyes were enough to make Qing Shui certain that her eyes and those of the beauty in the portrait were the same.</span></p>
  <p><span>Such a beauty really did exist, although the art maestro was able to paint her beauty, he unfortunately did not have this kind of good fortune to see the rumoured divine beauty.</span></p>
  <p><span>Although it was the first time Qing Shui’s actually saw the woman in front of him, he was 1000% sure that she was the woman from the painting. Her features and aura were so alike as though she walked out from the painting itself.</span></p>

 <p><span>She had been woken up like this numerous times. Ever since she appeared in that strange dream, this kind of situation had happened to her at least once a day or more.</span></p>
 <p><span>She didn’t know why, but she did not like this feeling. She even suspected that she might be hallucinating, but she knew deep down it was all real. The dream that happened within the sea of flowers had created a connection to that man with herself.</span></p>
 <p><span>There was a faint blush on the woman’s beautiful face, and her beauty had a hint of smokiness under the moonlight. Qing Shui would definitely exclaim how similar she was to Yiye Jiange if he saw that unearthly aura she had.</span></p>
 <p><span>This woman’s face was shockingly similar to Canghai Mingyue, and her aura was a combination of both Canghai Mingyue and Yiye Jiange. </span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly that ‘irritating’ feeling came again, and she couldn’t do anything to stop it. That invisible hand kept on fondling her soft bosom.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If you keep on doing this I will kill you!” The woman shouted out in her heart angrily and bashfully. This vented at him in a kind of compelled resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span>This woman was actually the Misty Hall Palace Mistress!</span></p>
 <p><span>But at this moment, Qing Shui who was immersed in that wonderful feeling was woken up abruptly, like he was met with a loud call from a general!</span></p>
 <p><span>“That was weird, I thought I heard her talking!” Qing Shui was bewildered as he thought about what has happened just now. Although it was the first time he heard this kind of voice, he was certain that this voice belonged to the woman he met in the erotic dream.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is it you, I can hear what you just said, were you talking to me?” Qing just talked to himself inside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Are you still there?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“.....”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui called out from the room like a lunatic, but in the end, he couldn’t hear anything from her. He didn’t know why, but he felt a bit disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui really wanted to thank the woman who had “lent” him a “big help”. But it was a shame that he didn’t know if she existed in the world of nine continents. </span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui suddenly thought of the “Spiritual sense interaction”. He thought that she might have used her spirit energy to spread her spiritual sense across a definite area as a method to yell at him.</span></p>
 <p><span>This method would require a very high actual strength, especially strength in one’s spirit energy!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui had surpassed the 5th layer of the realm, and had consumed two energy fruits beforehand, so his current spirit energy was much stronger than it was before.</span></p>
 <p><span>He spread his spiritual sense as far as possible, even Yan Ling ‘er who was currently on her bed appeared inside his spiritual sense. Moreover, there was a faint glow of a size of a fist around the hazy figure of Yan Ling’ er.</span></p>
 <p><span>After that, Qing Shui could see a few with the same faint glow. Just then, he understood that the area covered by his spiritual sense had expanded, as well as being able to check the strength of the “flame of life” inside a person’s body to sense their level of cultivation through the spiritual sense.</span></p>
 <p><span>He expanded his spiritual sense, although the distance he covered was not more than 10 metres after his breakthrough, he could expand further into the surroundings. After all, that was the rumoured ability of a saint. There were numerous hazy “flames of life” that appeared inside his spiritual sense, and their strengths were different from each other.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui suddenly felt that his spiritual sense was deliberately touched by something. That was a weird feeling, and he felt uncomfortable from it.</span></p>
 <p><span>This must what it is like to be spied on by other people. This must be the feeling of being found out and spied upon!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui shrunk back his spiritual sense and laid on the bed. He noticed this it was his first time he didn’t want to sleep. He didn’t know why, but he suddenly had a pressing need to go home.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, the Misty Hall Palace Mistress was absent-minded as her expression turned strange.</span></p>
 <p><span>“He is at the Heavenly Palace after all, and I could even feel his presence inside his own spiritual sense!”</span></p>
 <p><span>She thought over and over again, then she got up and put on her clothes. It was already late at night, but she didn’t care. It has been days since she could touch that familiar spiritual sense, moreover in the real realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>She thought the world of the nine continents was vast, she wondered who that man she met in the sea of flower’s dream was.</span></p>
 <p><span>She didn’t want to know, and she knew it was impossible to meet him. But she could never think that all of these would happen because of that mysterious portrait of beauty that bound them together, and that was how the mysterious dream happened. Moreover, the portrait allowed both of them to have a mysterious connection with each other. Because Qing Shui was in possession of the portrait of beauty, the Misty Hall Palace Mistress could only be a good girl and be fondled with no way to resist it.</span></p>
 <p><span>She put on her silver clothes and walked outside. If she use her spiritual sense, she could never go wrong! She could accurately find where Qing Shui was situated, so she decided to go and check where he is. She could not stand him slowly killing her from the inside, so this was the only way to redeem her old self.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just when Qing Shui started to dazedly fall asleep, he felt a strong aura approach. The reason Qing Shui was able to feel it was because of the familiar aura.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hmm, is it that aura who just spied on me?” Qing Shui felt the chills to his bones, because he felt that the aura was much more stronger than his own. This was also because her “flame of life” is especially brighter than anyone else’s. The brightness was as bright as a moon, and it was stronger than those weak flames of life he had seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span>“A woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui could tell that it is a woman from the hazy figure approaching. Moreover, it was a woman with a beautiful figure.</span></p>
 <p><span>“A woman with such background and such wonderful figure, who could it be?” Qing Shui randomly guessed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Knock knock knock!”</span></p>
 <p><span>A soft knock on the door! It sounded more bold in this lonely quiet night.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was at loss now, he knew that when a woman knocked on his door, two things may happen. One, was to have an affair with him, the other, was to come for “debt”.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui felt that the chance of an affair was little. After all, a strong woman came to find him by herself!</span></p>
 <p><span>Was she a person who looked to ask for repayment of debt? Qing Shui thought that there weren’t many who would do that. The Song Family, a bunch of families who were horribly beaten by him, or possibly the Xi Family, or maybe an assassin from Sword Tower...</span></p>
 <p><span>As he thought about it, he realized he has offended quite a lot of people. It seemed that a lot of people are after his life!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Knock knock knock!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The door knocking came back!</span></p>
 <p><span>The skilled should be bold. Qing Shui wasn’t scared. As he thought about it, he got up and wore his pajamas and walked to the door. But he didn’t open it!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who is it?” Qing Shui felt it was necessary to ask that question.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Me.” A simple word. Her voice was magnetic, with a bit of maturity. Just a single word has already brought great pleasure to him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who are you?” Qing Shui smiled as he asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If you open the door, then you will know. Are you still afraid that I will make a move on you? If I wanted to, do you think this door would hold me down?” The woman spoke out, and Qing Shui is enjoying this especially.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui gathered up all his might in his body, but he kept holding it in. He opened the door slowly, and froze when he took the first glance. All his defenses were thrown away.</span></p>
 <p><span>What peered into Qing Shui’s eyes was a woman who wore a veil with a full body in silver clothes. She only revealed a pair of beautiful eyes, and they were profound, but serene. It was unusual, but it wasn’t that bad. Her eyes were otherworldly, but they never lost its vastness. Too bad her gaze was of a chilly indifference.</span></p>
 <p><span>This time, Qing Shui was stupefied by that cold gaze. He had never seen such beautiful eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span>Yiye Jiange was otherworldly, Canghai Mingyue magnificent and exceedingly beautiful, Shi QingZhuang was cold, but the woman in front of him is a combination of all three of them. Those beautiful eyes were a perfect combination of all these auras, and they were enough to charm anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span>That woman from the portrait of beauty was standing right in front of Qing Shui. Although her face was covered by a veil, he could see the outline of her beautiful face. But those revealing eyes were enough to make Qing Shui certain that her eyes and those of the beauty in the portrait were the same.</span></p>
 <p><span>Such a beauty really did exist, although the art maestro was able to paint her beauty, he unfortunately did not have this kind of good fortune to see the rumoured divine beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although it was the first time Qing Shui’s actually saw the woman in front of him, he was 1000% sure that she was the woman from the painting. Her features and aura were so alike as though she walked out from the painting itself.</span></p>
