 <p><strong>AST 661 - Madam Duanmu, Assistance</strong></p>
 <p>The young man trembled and told him everything, not daring to hold back anything. In the end, the old man's brows started to furrow. In his fury, he killed the young man with his palm and looked into the distance with glaring eyes and clenched teeth.</p>
 <p>"Elder brother!" at this moment, a few elders walked over.</p>
 <p>"Let's talk inside!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and the three ladies rushed over to the Di Clan, they saw someone. It was a lady Qing Shui who unexpectedly didn't know how to face.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had never expected that she would come. They had just met a few days ago, but to Qing Shui, it seemed to have been a very long time ago. Most importantly, Qing Shui had not expected her to come again.</p>
 <p>She was having a chat with Di Qing's mother. A graceful and poised lady would always be the center of attraction. Madam Duanmu's disposition and charms were unrivaled.</p>
 <p>The last time they had said goodbye, it had been very emotional for Qing Shui. Now, Qing Shui could easily tell by using his spiritual sense that her cultivation level had reached the Grade Nine Martial Saint level. Qing Shui realized that his spiritual sense seemed to have become stronger after he had grown stronger.</p>
 <p>A strength of 4800 countries!</p>
 <p>After sensing Madam Duanmu's strength, he was astonished. He had not thought that their ‘cultivation’ last time would have made her so much stronger.</p>
 <p>After thinking about it, Qing Shui noticed a pattern. Women tended to get the greatest benefits when they go through Duo Cultivation for the first time. Another factor that should be considered was the lady's potential as well as her cultivation.</p>
 <p>The benefits that Qing Shui had received from Madam Duanmu were tremendous. At the same time, she had gained even more out of it. This was how Duo Cultivation was. Qing Shui was amazed by Madam Duanmu's strong physique as it was comparable to a lady like Canghai Mingyue, who had appeared on a Portrait of Beauty.</p>
 <p>After seeing Qing Shui, Madam Duanmu's expression turned a little unnatural and her gaze became a bit flighty. However, Qing Shui and the three ladies walked up to them very quickly.</p>
 <p>"Aunt Ruyan, you've come." Di Chen said happily.</p>
 <p>Both Di Qing and Yuan Su also greeted Madam Duanmu happily. After all, they knew how strong she was. A strong expert joining them at this juncture made them very happy.</p>
 <p>"Madam, you've come!"</p>
 <p>In fact, Qing Shui was not very calm either but he still greeted her with smiles.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, you guys have come back." Madam Duanmu calmed down and smiled at Qing Shui and the others.</p>
 <p>The three ladies left after giving their greetings. Qing Shui and Madam Duanmu were friends, and amongst those present, he was the closest to her. Therefore, the job of receiving Madam Duanmu naturally fell onto Qing Shui. Moreover, Qing Shui couldn’t be considered an outsider in the Di Clan. Not only was he the husband of the Di Clan's Young Miss, he would also play the most important role in the upcoming ‘Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death’. Everyone's lives were placed in his hands.</p>
 <p>"Have you been well?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui asked casually but after saying this, he could feel that it was impossible for them to go back to how they were before. Now, there was a strange feeling between the two of them.</p>
 <p>This strange feeling between them could as easily send someone down a wrong path as much as a right path. It could even cause a barrier to be formed between people, turning them into complete strangers.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu smiled and nodded, "Mmm, have you been well too?"</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I've been well! Why have you come here today?" Qing Shui knew that Madam Duanmu was also trying hard to make it seem as if they were the same as before. He did not dare to meet her gaze too much either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he was selfish. After that incident with Yu Ruyan, there were things that couldn’t be forgotten so easily. But so what if he couldn’t forget them? No matter if he could or could not, it would just be adding on to his troubles.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Madam Duanmu was stunned for a slight moment before she quickly recovered. "How can I not come when this has happened? If something were to happen to you, how am I going to answer your family members?"</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu smiled and said although she was feeling a little messed up.She did not even know why, but after the previous time, she had thought of keeping away from Qing Shui from and not meet him anymore.</p>
 <p>However, she also thought that it was unfair to Qing Shui. What had happened previously was not his fault. After one had attained Xiantian, one would be able to have a very long life. It was very normal to come across things that one had no control over. Therefore, Madam Duanmu decided not to try and not think too much about it. However, it was still very hard to do so, to the extent that she didn't know how to not think about it.</p>
 <p>"I didn't mean it that way. I feel bad to keep troubling you." Qing Shui knew that his words earlier were not really suitable and he quickly apologized.</p>
 <p>"Earlier, I had a chat with Mister and Madam Di. You're the one planning out for the ‘Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death; with three people participating, including yourself. Qing Shui, can you include me as well?" Madam Duanmu asked.</p>
 <p>"Madam, let's go over there and have a seat!" Qing Shui pointed to a pavilion at the side and said.</p>
 <p>"Mmm!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know how to face this poised lady. Moreover, Qing Shui did not wish for her to take part in this battle either. He felt that he would be affected if he did.</p>
 <p>"Madam, this time around, the participants for the ‘Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death’ has already been decided. Senior Di will be representing the Di Clan, Old Madam Mo is the strongest out of all of us here, and thus would need to join. You know that the techniques that I have been cultivating have its use in this battle. Madam, this time around, we're up against the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect. Therefore, we need to keep our guards up." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu turned silent. Sitting opposite Qing Shui, she lowered her head slightly.</p>
 <p>The two of them sat in the pavilion, with only a stone table between them. Qing Shui could smell her familiar fragrance. It was an indescribable scent, slightly stronger than a mild scent. It was a graceful and alluring smell.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui..."</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu seemed to want to say something but ended up not saying anything.</p>
 <p>"Madam, I understand your kind intentions. Madam is just thinking of paying back an act of goodwill many times over. It's the same for me. I'm extremely thankful. Back then, Miss Duanmu had met me due to fate. I had never thought that we would be able to meet again." Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Fate is really a strange thing. It can let many things and more happen between complete strangers. However, there are also times where it leaves people feeling helpless." Yu Ruyan said softly, her expression seemed to be slightly disappointed and distressed.</p>
 <p>At least now, when looking at this lady with a great appearance, Qing Clan could tell that she was actually very lonely. It wasn’t easy to support a big clan like the Duanmu Clan alone.</p>
 <p>After so many years, she hadn’t been able to meet a person she could share her deepest thoughts with. She must have a lot of things she wanted to talk to others about but she hadn’t met a person she could speak up to.</p>
 <p>"Is Madam still blaming herself? Everything was my fault. I don't know what to say to you." Qing Shui felt that she had yet to move on from that incident.</p>
 <p>"No. I've said it before that I don't blame you. If I did blame you, I'd rather choose to die. You've saved me. I should be thankful to you. Now that you're in trouble, how can I not come to help?" said Yu Ruyan as she feigned casualness.</p>
 <p>"Madam, erm... Have you thought of getting married again? I'm just making an assumption..." Qing Shui took a great effort to say this. He didn't know why he had said this either.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Madam Duanmu seemed shocked as she gave him a weird look, "Why do you ask?"</p>
 <p>"Madam is still young and you still have a long life ahead of you. After Miss Duanmu gets married in the future, won't you feel very lonely? Could it be that Madam Duanmu is really thinking of growing old by yourself like this?" Qing Shui asked slowly, feeling very hesitant. After all, the questions he had asked were all hard to answer.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu kept quiet for a while before she raised her head to look at Qing Shui. "I don't know. I don't think about these things either. Otherwise, I wouldn't have remained single all this time. In the future, if Lingshuang were to find her fated partner, I'll stay in the Duanmu Clan if they do. If they don't, then I'll just leave. I'm tired too. In fact, I've already started to let go of some of the things in Duanmu Clan. I just don't know if they'll be able to keep it up. I've already done my best."</p>
 <p>"In the future, if you were to feel lonely, come to Qing Clan. It'll become a home to you as well." Qing Shui gave it some thought before speaking, his tone was very calm.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan looked at Qing Shui in a daze. She didn’t know what Qing Shui meant by this words, nor did she see any hidden meanings he had intended to convey. However, her heart palpitated from his words.</p>
 <p>Previously, she gave it a lot of thought. Now, her heart would beat faster just from the thought of it. She gave Qing Shui a complicated look.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. If that day really comes, I'll consider it." Madam Duanmu said softly, seemingly a bit disappointed.</p>
 <p>"Madam, cheer up, don't think too much. When women are in a good mood, they'll become even more beautiful. Madam has both talent and looks as well as a beautiful daughter which would make others go green with envy. Although you have some regrets in life, no one lives a perfect life. Sometimes, slight imperfections is a beauty in and of itself." Qing Shui smiled and looked at this graceful and poised lady who gave him a familiar feeling.</p>
 <p>"I understand your kind intentions. There is no need to be worried about me. I'm not that frail. You're better off focusing on dealing with this trial you're facing." Madam Duanmu smiled and stood up.</p>
 <p>Looking at Madam Duanmu as she departed, Qing Shui felt very complicated. After all, Madam Duanmu was different from that lady from the Feng Clan. Even that lady, Qing Shui hadn’t been able to completely forget her. However, it was a trade and even though the Qing Clan had forced himself to forget her, he would still think about her occasionally.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Qing Shui decided not to think too deeply into it. Just like what Madam Duanmu had said, he'll have to deal with this trial before him first. As for the other things, it'll have to be left and dealt with in the future. Maybe a good solution would appear even if he didn't think too hard about it.</p>
 <p>When evening arrived, the people from the Nian Clan had arrived, including Nian Feng and his grandfather. It wasn't just them. Even Qianyu Dingjun had come. However, Qianyu Qingqing, Qianyu He, and the others didn't come.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui didn't tell them, he still felt very happy to see that they've come. His opponents had formed an alliance between five clans and now there was an alliance between Di Clan, Alchemist Sect, Duanmu Clan, Nian Clan, and the Qianyu Clan, they could approximately stand on equal grounds now.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, under these circumstances, he knew that they had come because of him. Qing Shui now knew that they were friends he could trust. They dared to come forth for him, giving up many other things. There were even those who hadn’t even planned on leaving alive.</p>
 <p>This was what made Qing Shui felt very moved. However, there were also those who came because of other reasons. After all, Madam Duanmu and her daughter were indebted to Qing Shui since he had saved their lives. It was the same for Qianyu Dingjun's daughter.</p>
 <p>These were people who knew to return favors, even at the risk of their own lives.</p>
