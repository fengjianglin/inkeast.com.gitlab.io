 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2312 - Overwhelming Army, The Battle Has Started</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Chi Clan, you guys force us time and time again. Today, we'll settle this once and for all. There's no need for you to spread any more rumors."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This dominating old monk was the Divine Buddha Sect's sect lord. As for whether he was the strongest existence in the Divine Buddha Sect, it was something which no one knew. However, just his status as the Divine Buddha Sect's sect lord was sufficient as a proof of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang looked at this person who should be an old man. He had no hair nor beard, and thus looked a little young. However, the words that he said made him sound like an insolent, retarded old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Divine Buddha Sect, when I see you again and hear what you say, I feel that the words 'Divine Buddha Sect' are very disgusting. The Chi Clan forces you time and time again? Did we force you to wipe out our Chi Clan? Did we force you to go all the way to the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain to remove all the remnants? You're already so old, so why is it that the words you say all sound like crap? Have you been living all your years as a dog?" Chi Yang asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was stunned. Although Chi Yang's character wasn't especially mild, he was still considered to be a more gentle kind of a person. Qing Shui felt that Chi Yang wasn't really the type to quarrel or scold others. However, Qing Shui discovered a new thing. A person who was extremely infuriated would be filled with the power of fury, and that power would be included in the words they said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a person was infuriated, their blood and energy would surge. At this moment, the power of their blood would increase by 20%. This was the same even for ordinary people. This kind of power wouldn't be factored into consideration to their overall strength. This power was a little hard to explain and was also extremely unstable. Sometimes, it could only last for one attack before the person returned to their original state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's just an old dog, a shameless old dog."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Divine Buddha Sect had also once been an embodiment of justice, but look at what they have become now. Their ancestors who had died are probably waiting down there to teach them a lesson."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is what they mean when one does shameless things but yet still wants to be respected. I now know what a hypocrite is like. Looking at him makes a villain appear especially cute." Hao Tian laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't curse but just continued to look at that four-eyed black toad. Through his Heavenly Vision Technique, Qing Shui noticed that this was a pure-blooded ancient demonic beast. It was very powerful with a strong blood lineage. Not only did it have a strong body, but it also excelled in sound waves and poison attack. It was also skillful in both the water and earth elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This four-eyed black toad was too strong. This made Qing Shui feel that this four-eyed black toad should be the Divine Buddha Sect's Guardian Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Young man, you're too impolite. Didn't your senior tell you to respect your elders?" The old man wasn't anxious and put up an appearance as if he was teaching juniors a lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since you want to settle things, then I'll let you have your wish." Chi Yang couldn't be bothered to continue the crap talk with the old monk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reverend Human Buddha stared at Qing Shui with an extremely intense vicious glow in his eyes. He no longer appeared as calm as he had been in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, when we start fighting later, be careful of that four-eyed toad. Don't charge on too fast and be stable. You don't have to worry about the other things." Qing Shui said softly to Chi Yang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;"Alright! What should I do later?" Chi Yang asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You can just fight that old monk then. I'll help you to confine him." Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, then let's do it. Buddha Lingering Chant!" The image of a Buddha appeared before the old monk and concurrently, a faint Buddhist chant rang out in the surroundings. This was like the light rays at dawn, where a mysterious power rose in the surroundings. The will of battle for the people on the opposing side was very high, and even their strength had been raised by a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Remember the way to enter and leave the formation. Don't overdo things as they have more people on their side. Once you see the situation isn't good, enter the formation first. You'll be safe then." Qing Shui said to everyone. Those people who were seriously injured couldn't take part in the battle, but all of them stood in the formation, watching. They hoped to be able to join in the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opposing side had surrounded the entire Chi Clan. After all, they had too many people on their side. Qing Shui came out from an exit of the formation. He had already applied formations, and the one he had used was the Cone-shaped Formation﻿. He and Chi Yang stood at the very front, together with Qing Shui's Dragon Slaying Beast, Diamond White Tiger King, and other demonic beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wanted to make use of his powerful defense to make an opening on the opponents' side. Therefore, the moment he headed out, he applied weakening techniques on the enemies repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And then, he instantly killed one of the experts with a Stellar Transposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buddha Wisdom Seal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's Buddha Wisdom Seal hit the old monk. This old monk also had a very terrifying strength. Qing Shui performed his movement technique and then the Berserk Dragon Fist. The Nine Continents Mountain kept plunging down, and the Dragon Slaying Beast kept on charging forth while working together with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Zhu`er's huge body also darted about rapidly, and there were countless demonic spiders around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui's side came out, the opponents made their moves as well. The sea of humans charged out toward Qing Shui. However, even though they had strength in numbers, there weren't many of them who fought directly. After all, there weren't that many people on Qing Shui's side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom boom...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Loud clashing sounds kept ringing out and streams of brilliant glow kept exploding in the sky. The old monk and some others led the fight, and Chi Yang waved his Scarlet Flaming Saber and fought against the old monk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thankfully, with the strengthening effects of Qing Shui's skills in addition to Qing Shui having weakened the old monk, Chi Yang managed to be on the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fight went on and the opposing side suffered great casualties. The Nine Continents Mountain kept on dispersing their groups. Qing Shui didn't let the people from the Chi Clan charge out too far in case they weren't able to return to the formation in times of need. If that were to happen, there wouldn't be enough people on the Chi Clan's side to activate the Killing Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the weakening effect, many people were unable to take Qing Shui's current Berserk Dragon Fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Windwhisk Willow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying sharp arrow struck the head of a member of the Chi Clan, causing the person's head to explode on the spot. A bit of chaos immediately spread around the people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui rapidly searched through the crowd. Most people's arrows couldn't be this fast nor would they have such terrifying power. A person with such a capability would already be considered a marksman, and there wouldn't be many of them. Otherwise, the Chi Clan would be annihilated instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui soon saw a man in golden armor; he was holding a huge bow. He appeared to be middle-aged with a tall and muscular build, and he was almost 1.5 times the height of ordinary people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone from the Demonic Elephant Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people from the Demonic Elephant Sect had a tall stature, just like little giants. They had the blood lineage of huge elephants in them, rumored to be that of the Divine Elephant. If someone amongst them had really revived the true Divine Elephant's blood lineage, then the Demonic Elephant Sect would be able to rise up once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the man had drawn his bow, aiming toward Chi Yang who was in the midst of battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn't all. Qing Shui saw that the four-eyed black toad's huge body suddenly bulged up, and it instantly became bigger, like a small mountain.</span></p>
