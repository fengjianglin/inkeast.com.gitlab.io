 <p><strong>AST 601 - Stopover, Jade Sea</strong></p>
 <p>“Right, are you asking this about Madame Duanmu because you have enmity with her? I don’t have much of a connection with them. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll ask our old elder to step in.” Qianyu Dingjun offered after thinking for awhile.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Uncle Jun but there is no enmity. The alchemist who cured Madame Duanmu was me. I just wanted to see if she was worth befriending.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“She is definitely a good friend to have. She is a person that will remember you even if you gave her just a little help. Not to mention that you even saved her life. I’d say that besides her daughter, she will probably give you anything you ask for.” Qianyu Dingjun was first shocked before he happily said this.</p>
 <p>Di Chen, Qianyu Qingqing, Qianyu Feifei and the mother of the two girls only stayed went upstairs. As such, only Qing Shui, Qianyu He, and Qianyu Dingjun were left behind in the living room.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, how long will you be staying in the Central Continent this time?” Qianyu He rarely spoke. He usually just listens silently. Now that the conversation seemed to have quietened down, he started to ask this question.</p>
 <p>“I can’t say for sure. I may stay for quite a long time.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Jun won’t ask you about your purpose here. Just remember, if you need help you can always look for me.” Qianyu Dingjun said calmly and sincerely.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded. Previously, when he was not considered that strong by their standards, they had treated him well. Qing Shui knew that this was because they were grateful that he had saved their daughter and not because of his strength. The last time he came, his was considered quite powerful among the younger generation, but it was impossible for him to compare with Qianyu Dingjun and the others. Right now, they were probably unable to tell what his current strength was. Furthermore, who would believe that a person could improve so quickly in such a short time?</p>
 <p>There was no such thing as hatred or love birth for no reason. Much less favoring the rich over the poor, or playing up to those in power. As the ways of the world are as such, people would strive to climb higher, it was a valuable thing to be able to keep to one’s principles and values.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui and Di Chen were met with an awkward situation. As they were a ‘married’ couple, they were only given one room.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Look at what has happened, I will have to sleep on the floor now.” Qing Shui smiled at Di Chen.</p>
 <p>In a subtle way, Qing Shui realized that the relationship between Di Chen and him had changed. Qing Shui did not know if it was because it was something psychological after he had seen the Red-Lined Snake or because Di Chen had actually changed.</p>
 <p>Di Chen seemed a little apologetic but she actually did not say a word!</p>
 <p>These were just empty words from Qing Shui. When night fell, Qing Shui excused himself and went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to train.</p>
 <p>He left for an entire night but Di Chen could not close her eyes in that time. This was the first time in many years that she felt her heart in disarray. She knew that she had not fallen in love with Qing Shui but he was still the closest man to her.</p>
 <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui entered, he saw a small demonic beast surfacing from the water. Its body was covered in a translucent and sparkling purple. It was about one meter and was very lively. It could easily move between water and land and its speed was incredibly fast.</p>
 <p>Once it came out of the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, it was already a peak Martial King demonic beast. Two months had passed, which it was about ten years in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The little creature grew very slowly, but it was obvious that it was now a little bigger. Qing Shui had not given it any sort of Endurance Pellets or Beast Pills.</p>
 <p>In the first hundred years of its life, he needed to let the creature mature normally, without any sort of intervention. Otherwise, its future growth will be affected, and he will not be able to make up for the future losses with this short term gain. In addition to that, Qing Shui’s relationship with the Thunderous Beast would get stronger with each passing day.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui told the creature not to touch the things within the pond. He found out that the Thunderous Beast would only eat the Rainbow Trout Fish. Luckily, there were now quite a number of Rainbow Trout fishes in the pond and the little Thunderous Beast had a somewhat limited appetite.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast needed one thousand years to mature. With the current power of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it would only take five years of normal time for it to mature. What sort of growth-boosting medicine could be comparable to the Realm?</p>
 <p>At the later half of the night, Qing Shui came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and looked out at the stars outside. After his morning exercise and eating breakfast with the Qianyu family, Qing Shui and Di Chen left for the Jade Sea Country.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>As they journeyed, Qing Shui noticed a change in Di Chen’s emotion. He knew that it was because he left the room last night. But if he did not leave, what else could he do? As such, there was was an awkwardness between them as they continued on the road.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen, I really didn't mean anything. I did not have a choice last night. In the past, Sister Chen could defeat me. Naturally, if I did anything wrong to you, you would fight me off. But now, what if I can’t control my lust. What could you do?” Qing Shui grimaced as he touched his nose.</p>
 <p>“You only know how to say this sort of nonsense.” Di Chen could not help but laugh out, looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Seeing her like this, Qing Shui sighed in relief. After that, to pass time, they chatted casually about some of the interesting things in the World of the Nine Continents. Qing Shui also told some of the jokes he knew from his previous life.</p>
 <p>After three days, Qing Shui and Di Chen finally arrived at Jade Sea Country.</p>
 <p>At the Drunken Immortal Inn...</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui is here! Grandfather was just saying that you will come back soon.” Nian Feng said politely when he saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“How is he?” Qing Shui patted Nian Feng’s shoulder and laughed.</p>
 <p>After introducing Di Chen, Nian Feng found out that Qing Shui would be staying in Jade Sea Country for some time. He would use the time to train and find out more about Seven Stars City, especially about the Di Clan.</p>
 <p>This time, Nian Feng brought Qing Shui and Di Chen to an isolated small courtyard. “Brother Qing Shui, you can stay here whenever you are around next time.”</p>
 <p>The location was very good. Qing Shui saw that there was a courtyard surrounded by only a few buildings. It was split into a front and back court.</p>
 <p>When they entered, they found it to be very comfortable. The rooms were clean and the scenery was excellent. Qing Shui chose to stay without feeling modest about it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui visited the Nian Clan because he wanted to see Nian Feng’s grandfather. The Nian Clan was quite famous in Jade Sea Country as it was a large clan and had existed for a long time.</p>
 <p>Nian Feng’s grandfather was the most powerful person in the clan but he was not the head. Despite that, even the head of the clan had to listen to his words as he was the protector of the family.</p>
 <p>Succession in the Nian Clan was a fair process. All the descendants of the clan had a chance of being the head of the clan and to become a core member of the clan.</p>
 <p>Nian Feng was one of the leaders in the young generation within the Nian Clan and was also the grandson of Grandfather Nian. Naturally, his words held some weight in the family.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Qing Shui and Di Chen stayed in the well located small courtyard. Di Chen stayed on the third floor while Qing Shui stayed on the second floor. The first floor was the living room.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen, why don’t we have a look at the Jade Sea today?” Qing Shui asked Di Chen as they finished breakfast.</p>
 <p>“Jade Sea? Sure, I heard that it is a very beautiful inland sea.”</p>
 <p>Riding his Fire Bird, it took them less than half a day to reach the Jade Sea. From a distance, they could see the very lively seaside. Even though they were quite far, Qing Shui decided to let his Fire Bird land first.</p>
 <p>Somehow, Qing Shui unintentionally spotted commotion at the seaside. A shocked scream was followed by the crisp sound of a slap.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the person who was slapped, he was furious! The person who was slapped was a lady. The sound of the slap was as clear as thunder resulting in a handprint left on her face.</p>
 <p>Lan Tong!</p>
 <p>Lan Tong was slapped!</p>
