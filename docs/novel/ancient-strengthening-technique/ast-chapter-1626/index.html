 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 1626 - Tantai Xuan’s Feelings</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan didn’t resist much. She merely struggled against his grasp momentarily without much conviction, allowing the man to pull her along as he pleased. Never had she ever thought that there would be another woman being tugged along when she was getting held by a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was caught in a dilemma as well but he must reserve his pride as the last of his priority when facing Tantai Xuan. Watching the resignation in this imposing, elegant and out-of-this-world woman made him smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Ruyan opened her heart because of Qing Shui. She had set her sights on Qing Shui, developing a liking of the latter and she was more than satisfied with her current life. With regard to the several women by Qing Shui’s side, she really didn’t plan on taking any action about them. She had never planned on trailing behind him forever, just like how they were now. She preferred it this way. She preferred when Qing Shui would come to visit when he missed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could understand the rationale behind Yu Ruyan's thoughts and at least half of his women thought the same. In fact, he had believed it was fine this way too. After all, it was unrealistic to wish for them to gather under the same roof. After all, many of his women were the Mistress of their own sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once again, Qing Shui appreciated the current world he’s in. Unlike his previous life, there was no need to register your marriage or declare the birth of your child. Here, it was only necessary to prove your marriage to your relatives and friends, and for your child to be entered into the pedigree of your lineage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the World of the Nine Continents. It was the world of clans, sects, and dynasties. Even within the dynasty, sects and clans formed a great number. Within the scope of the sect governance, the number of clans was great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, more accurately, this world was made up of clans. Sects were also made up of clans and the ruler of the dynasty was also part of the royal clan, with interest for the clan placed above everything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I have missed you both so much!" Qing Shui strolled along the mountaintop with the two women. Although the surrounding flowers and trees were naturally grown, they were still more beautiful than those artificially cultivated. From time to time, some bird-type beasts would appear, filling this world with infinite elements of beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You must mean that you miss Sister Ruyan instead!" Tantai Xuan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Little Sister Xuan, I think he missed you more." Yu Ruyan responded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t speak. It would be unwise to speak at this time. Although claiming that he missed both of them could work, it would be a little hypocritical. Rather than replying, just chuckling would probably be a better reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a plot of grassland ahead, so dense and untouched. With a slight breeze, it looked like a bed made from nature, densely packed with green grass which was more than a foot high, tilting in one direction. It felt soft and comfortable as they walked on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ray of the sun warmed the earth below their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's beautiful here. Sister Ruyan and I would lay here whenever we have the time." Tantai Xuan said with a smile. It was only after the words left her that she felt it sounded inappropriate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smirked as he gazed towards the horizon. "Your words made me want to lie down and experience it for myself. Come on, let's go there and bask in the warmth of the sun."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan felt as if she had just smashed a rock against her own feet. The three of them reached the slope, slanting at approximately 35 degrees in angle. It was a comfortable spot to lay in. Qing Shui had Yu Ruyan on his left and Tantai Xuan on his right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking from side to side, Qing Shui couldn’t help swallowing the lump in his throat at the beautiful sight of their plump and perky chest as they laid down. Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan had naturally noticed his gaze and couldn’t help but blush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui held a woman on each hand and though it hadn’t amounted to embracing one on each arm, it was practically the same. Their bodies were stuck very close to each other. Tantai Xuan’s mind wasn’t as calm and tranquil as it was usually. Her heart was beating faster and the memory of the affectionate scene she witnessed of Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan replayed in her mind from time to time. With those thoughts, there was no way she could remain calm. After all, she was still a woman who had not experienced much in life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Ruyan was a little flustered because of Tantai Xuan's presence. Qing Shui asked them to catch him up on the events during the time he was gone, on topics like what happened after they came here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything was fine after the conversation began to roll. From time to time, they would stumble upon hilarious incidents which made them gradually relax. Pushing his luck, Qing Shui slowly reached out and embraced Yu Ruyan with an arm so she was stuck to his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Ruyan was mature and also very traditional. Although she was embarrassed, she didn’t resist. She buried her face in Qing Shui’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long before Qing Shui extended his demon clutches towards Tantai Xuan as well. It didn’t take much effort before he was really embracing a woman on each arm. Even so, they didn’t go beyond that</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was just a partial embrace, the chests of the two women were pressed firmly against Qing Shui’s body. The feeling of their bounciness made him abandon himself to the pleasure. It was a form of satisfaction in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that all men’s “desire in possession” is this strong?” Tantai Xuan glanced at the satisfied look in Qing Shui's expression and pinched his waist lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This has nothing to do with “desire in possession”. Am I the kind of man who wants to claim any beautiful woman I see?” Qing Shui looked at Tantai Xuan and spoke unflinchingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I think you are exactly that kind of person." Tantai Xuan responded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young lady, how dare you doubt my character." With the hand holding on to her, Qing Shui patted her perky bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t painful, but it still emitted a crisp sound. It didn’t require any skill to make such a crisp sound through the layers of clothes, but it did require deliberate effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan’s body quivered and she buried her face in the crook of his arms without another word. Qing Shui could already decipher Tantai Xuan's feelings. Everything was already self-explanatory at this stage. He held her waist. “I know I am a scum, but it’d be easier to kill me than for me to let go of both of you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"And you claim it has nothing to do with a strong “desire in possession”. Men are all like this." Although Tantai Xuan had let go a lot and had allowed herself a wider perspective, it was still difficult to achieve what she envisioned her life to be. It might even be impossible to attain. After all, there wouldn’t be a lack of women around a great man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright. If you say that, it is so. Still, I love you both as a person. All of you are the most important in my heart. For any of you, I can disregard the cost, even if it means losing my life."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't jinx it, why do you say stuff like that?" Tantai Xuan didn’t like to talk about life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then, do you understand my feelings now?" Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You are just looking for an excuse for your romantic affairs. Anyway, I can’t be bothered with you. I'll be here with Sister Ruyan. You can visit whenever you miss Sister Ruyan." Tantai Xuan chuckled.</span></p>

Qing Shui smiled as he watched Tantai Xuan.</span></p>

You’ll naturally find me when you come back." Tantai Xuan sat up and laughed.</span></p>

Must you force Little Sister Xuan to say it loud and clear before you can understand?" Yu Ruyan laughed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Tantai Xuan was leaving to give Yu Ruyan and himself some time together. It was why she left right after her declaration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Little Sister Xuan really likes you." Yu Ruyan smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>

Little beauty, I missed you to death..."</span></p>

The earth was their bed and the sky was their covers. Soon, a beautiful melody sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

The two women lived on a man-made island in the center of Feng Yan Lake. Although Feng Yan Lake was called a lake, it was much bigger than those in his past life. What’s more, even lakes had those that were greater in size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once they were back, Yu Ruyan left, allowing Qing Shui to look for Tantai Xuan. Likewise, Qing Shui let her go. After Yu Ruyan pushed Qing Shui towards the direction of Tantai Xuan's room, she immediately returned to her own room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed the tip of his nose at that. Among his own women, &nbsp;Tantai Xuan and Qin Qing were the only ones who were still persistent. Now, Tantai Xuan was not as persistent as she had been in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there was some distance between him and Tantai Lingyan, they still had a past that could not be erased. Hence, Qing Shui was confident that it's only a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan's room was unlocked. Qing Shui opened it with a slight push. He was greeted by the sight of Tantai Xuan standing by the window, watching the lake in the distance. From here, you could see the movements of the fishes and the like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Noticing the sound, she turned back to see Qing Shui. "You’re back. Where’s Sister Ruyan?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"She’s tired..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan froze before she blushed, and couldn't help her words. "You scoundrel. Can you not be this terrible?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went to her side with a smile plastered on his face. “A wise man had once said that the desire for food and sex is a part of human nature. That means that the desire for&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">is just as important as eating. The saying was intended for ordinary people who need to eat to survive. Unlike them, warriors like us can live without eating for a long time. That’s why&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">is even more important than eating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his understanding of Tantai Xuan's feelings from before, he figured that it would only drag on if he remained reserved with his words. Therefore, once Qing Shui saw the absence of Tantai Xuan’s displeasure, he didn’t restrain his comments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have a lot of twisted logic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This isn’t twisted logic. Humans have seven emotions and six sensory pleasures. It would only be abnormal if they do not. &nbsp;Even animals know this too. This is just simply instinct." Qing Shui smiled and took her hand in his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan’s hand shivered a little as she looked at Qing Shui. "You said you wanted to pursue me and you promised me that unless I agreed, you wouldn’t be impolite."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui held her by her waist and whispered softly in her ear, "Of course I remember and I will keep my promise, but you also promised that I could hug you too. I promise I won’t do anything without your consent and I understand your feelings too. Even then, don't you want to try kissing?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui blew a light breath in her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t understand women all that well, but he understood that women’s desires are just as passionate as men. The difference was that women are more emotional. For example, a flirtatious atmosphere will be tempting for women. The most crucial factor is that Qing Shui knew that Tantai Xuan was no longer discriminating against him like before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A woman's desire was even more abundant than men once ignited. At the sound of Qing Shui’s words and his breath against the shell of her ear, Tantai Xuan recalled the intimate scene of Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan. The impact of the visual and sensation, along with the sound Yu Ruyun was making made her heart race faster. This was just human instinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t we try?” Qing Shui asked provocatively as he watched more of her beautiful face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan's long eyelashes fluttered. Words failed her and she hated his initiative innately. How was it that she was still allowing him to hold her despite the nonsense he was spouting? She no longer resisted. Did he really want to make her say it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui wasn’t an expert in love, he still had experienced a lot. He was doing this deliberately. Watching the tender expression on Tantai Xuan's face brought him great satisfaction.</span></p>
