 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 483 - All demoness exudes feminine charm. A ten years promise</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Jin Guyao finished speaking, she looked at Qing Shui in agony: “Little brother……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s enough!” Qing Shui immediately interrupted Jin Guyao. He didn’t even bother to look at her. He extended his arm to stop the enraged Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who is she? I don’t care who she is. In short, no one is allowed to bully her, including you!” Until this moment only did Qing Shui look at the bewildered Jin Guyao who was standing there.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As a mistress from Jin Clan, she has always been spoiled by other people. People would always feel reluctant to berate her. Adding on to the fact that she had a face as beautiful as a flower, she would only receive compliments and blessings everywhere she went.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She has never felt this wronged before. All that she did was just defend herself from the woman. In fact, it was the woman who started criticizing her. Who would have thought that he would actually get angry at her for that woman?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Prior to this, hasn’t he always been defending her? Even at the time when her grandpa criticized her, he still tried to fight back for her. So why would he behave like this now?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is that the girl that he liked?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Guyao! Mind your language!” At this moment, Jin Changzheng could tell that Qing Shui has really gotten angry. He quickly told Jin Guyao off.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The reason he came today was to build up a good relationship with Qing Shui. Originally, he had thought that Qing Shui was interested in his sister. Furthermore, at the time when his sister acted recklessly, not only did Qing Shui didn’t blame her, he even tried to defend her for it. That was why he didn’t say anything this time. It’s just that he didn’t expect him to turn over them so soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a limit to the number of times to which Qing Shui could tolerate her. Previously, it was because she did it in front of the elders in Jin Clan. Besides, her headstrong behavior was only at the level of a girl throwing a tantrum. But now, she had gone too far and it made Qing Shui felt disgusted. Qing Shui has always despised this kind of spoiled girl. This kind of temper and attitude had made Qing Shui feel that there was a huge difference between her and the women around him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you like her? Which part of her is better than me?” Jin Guyao asked Qing Shui as she pointed at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui felt that this woman was totally unreasonable when she lost her mind. It gave people the impression that he was discarding something once it lost its uses. He knitted his brows in disgust as he looked at the woman who, to Qing Shui, was beautiful from the outside but ugly on the inside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt that there wasn’t any feminine qualities of her which could move his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It has always been said that women needed to be gentle like a clear pond and also lively like ripples.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sometimes, women couldn’t just rely on their looks. A perfect woman was a woman who could make people fall for them by relying on their personality.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s not that a woman who was capable of making a man neglect their beauty and love them for life wasn’t beautiful. It’s just that they could make the man not put too much emphasis on their beauty. A woman who could cause a ripple in a man’s heart only through their eyes and every single one of their actions and words. This was the true definition of a beautiful woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though this woman looked really young from her appearance. This woman who was slightly older than Qing Shui had made Qing Shui felt that there wasn’t anything good that could make him admire her other than her cultivation level and her decent-looking face.She could only be considered as an average vase.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though a vase was beautiful, it was really brittle. It wouldn’t be able to bear the destruction brought about by time.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hence, Qing Shui felt that women didn’t just need to look beautiful. It’s more important that they were self-restrained and ladylike. However, a good personality, a feminine side and the ability to restrain themselves were not something that could be developed so easily. Without a certain amount of understanding towards culture, life experience as well as a certain amount of training, it would be tough to prepare a dish with an intoxicating flavor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Normally, things like this shouldn’t happen for a family like Jin Clan. However, Qing Shui thought that it might be that Jin Guyao has just been spoiled too much since she was small.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She hasn’t experienced anything significant. She could get whatever she wanted. She never lacked compliments and assistance from other people. Furthermore, wherever she went, she would receive flowers and applause. If it hadn’t been because Jin Clan was powerful, she would have ended up as a slave in some unknown people’s back garden.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, I like her, and also, she is better than you in every aspect.” At this moment, Qing Shui said in an ordinary manner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without anyone noticing, Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji as well as Mingyue Gelou who was carrying Yu Chong have already left. At this moment, only a few youngsters remained at the doorway. The surrounding atmosphere wasn’t really good.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Guyao……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, today, I want to know which aspects of her is better than me. Don't tell me that she looks more beautiful than me, I don't think that I would be inferior to her in terms of that.” When Jin Guyao started being unruly, she wouldn't listen to even Jin Changzheng.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, you really want to hear?” Said Qing Shui while he knitted his brows.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I want to hear. I want to see if you can manage to convince me with it.” Jin Guyao looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Actually, do you know that you don't look pretty to me at all? Do you know what features a beautiful woman is supposed to have?” Qing Shui noticed that there was no need for him to get angry with the woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao stared at Qing Shui in shock: “ I don't look pretty? Which part of me doesn't look pretty? My face? Eyes? Nose? Or hands?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“All the features that you just mentioned, how long would it last? Twenty years? Fifty years?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“But without the medicines which could halt people from aging, who would be able to stay young their entire life?” Jin Guyao had obviously piqued an interest in Qing Shui’s words.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“One of the most important features of a beautiful woman is a kind heart. Only with a kind heart will a woman look beautiful in other people’s eyes.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“And?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“And being ladylike!” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is it the fragrant smell on a woman’s body? I have that too!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao words almost made Qing Shui pass out. An uncivilized woman was truly terrifying. For a woman like this, even if they had looked more beautiful, they would still only make men interested in their body. Other than that, the men wouldn't be interested in any more of their stuffs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A ladylike woman. It describes a woman who is gentle like a clear pond and yet can also be lively like ripples. Every woman has their most gentle side. They are like water and honey, mist and fog. Each and every one of her actions, the way she extends her back, the way she combs her hair, each and every one of it, are like rippling waters. A woman’s smile is a half-blossomed flower. Within it flows a picturesque charm.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words immediately stunned a few women.It might be because there weren't many women who were able to admit that they could do it even though they were able to feel these words. Despite that, among the people who was present, there were still people who were capable of doing it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A woman with a gentle posture, black hair straight like waterfall and skin pale like snow. A pair of amorous eyes as calm as lakewater and a smile as beautiful as roses, her feminine side would strike directly onto one’s face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were like lily flowers that quietly blossomed in the lakewater under the moonlight. A woman like this was a radiant woman. A woman who was as gentle as water, a woman who was fair and considerate.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For an unkind woman, even if she was devastatingly beautiful, even if she possessed talents that stood out, she still wouldn’t be a cute and outstanding woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled the memories of the ladylike women that he encountered in the past and also his experiences of being a human for two lives. At this moment, he no longer wanted to have anything to do with this spoiled woman. Qing Shui disliked the woman who always put herself above everything else.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Jin, it’s fine, you guys can leave now, I still have things that I need to do.” Qing Shui smiled as he interrupted Jin Changzheng’s words.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The way people act, whether they were friendly or unfriendly, depends on whether one was successful. But until now, Qing Shui still failed to understand Jin Clan’s actions. Actually, it would have been really easy for Jin Clan to set up a good impression to him. However, they found it unnecessary to do so. Perhaps, they might have overlooked this issue.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Who said that aristocratic clans would often be far-sighted?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui has intended to be friends with Jin Clan. After all, it was easy to find friends, but it's difficult to find those who knew you well. It’s already such a rare opportunity to be friends with them, let alone being soulmates!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In any case, Qing Shui couldn’t figure out why Jin Clan was like this. But now, he was finally aware that Jin Clan was trying to seek contact with him for their own benefits. It’s just that would he act so lowly as to accept their offer?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, grandpa has prepared dinner for you. He has also prepared a special gift which you will definitely like.” When Jin Changzheng saw Qing Shui didn't say anything, he spoke quickly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let's go back!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pulled both Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue and went inside with them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, what shall we do?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Jin Guyao looked at Jin Changzheng. She looked a bit worried. Today’s incident was almost ruined because of her unruliness. Every time Jin Guyao thought about it, she would feel hurt and mad at herself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She remembered that she was an unkind and foolish woman in Qing Shui’s heart.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What made him have the right to say so?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, Huoyun Liu-Li was really happy. She hugged one of Qing Shui’s arm and from time to time, she would look at Qing Shui. She felt extremely elated deep in her heart. She heard Qing Shui said that he liked her and that she was better than that woman in every aspect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Previously, Jin Guyao’s words had already made her really furious. When Huoyun Liu-Li met a woman like this, she got so mad that she didn’t even have the energy to argue with her. But at the instant when Qing Shui stood up for her, Huoyun Liu-Li felt really good.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From time to time, she would look at Qing Shui. She also noticed that he didn’t look unhappy. On the contrary, he had a trace of faint smile on his face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Say whatever you want. Don’t restrain yourself.” Qing Shui noticed Huoyun Liu-Li has been hesitating to speak for quite a while. He could already figure out what kind of questions she wanted to ask judging by how much he knew her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, is sister ladylike?” Huoyun Liu-Li laughed happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li! What kind of nonsense are you saying?” Canghai Mingyue blushed as she looked angrily at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course she is, she smells exceptionally good……” Said Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words made Canghai Mingyue lower her head slightly. It reminded her of the words Qing Shui said to her yesterday. Was that a confession? And this scoundrel……. She felt really weird but at the same time really happy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then am I……” Huoyun Liu-Li mumbled like she was hiding something &nbsp;when she was asking this question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw Huoyun Liu-Li’s expression, he really wanted to laugh. After all, she was still a woman, she still had a shy side. Normally, this kind of time was the time when they tend to be more frail.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui was planning to tease her. But now, he was aware that it’s not an appropriate time for him to do it anymore.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Little brat, since when have you become so uncertain about yourself? You are a demoness, all demoness are very ladylike.” Qing Shui chuckled as he pinched her pink and soft cheek.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Go away! Don’t pinch my cheeks.” Huoyun Liu-Li said angrily. After that, she happily extended her arm pinched Qing Shui’s face back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the afternoon, Qing Shui went to Elder Xing to retrieve the materials of the Tigon Beast Champion. It was already tidied up. One whole bundle of Beast Parchment with only very little Beast Blood. Even though the majority of the blood has flowed out, he still managed to collect a few jars of it. There were also some Beast Bones and Beast Tendons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui has finally gotten his materials for Talisman Drawings. He reckoned that if other Talisman Drawers found out that Qing Shui was learning Talisman Drawings and that he was using a high-grade Demonic Beast Parchment to learn refining, they would most likely be so surprised to the point they dropped their eyeballs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui straight away put all of the things into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the middle of the day, there was a person who came to Qing Shui and informed him that the Old Ancestor was looking for him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly. He once again visited &nbsp;the stone mountain. He saw the Old Ancestor standing on the stone mountain looking into the distance, it was unknown if he was looking at the boundless sky or contemplating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He turned around slowly when Qing Shui arrived on the stone mountain and looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I greet Old Ancestor!” Qing Shui bowed down and saluted him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘Hehe, alright, alright!” The Old Ancestor laughed happily when he saw Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed the back of his head. He knew that the Old Ancestor would surely try to convince him about something.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor, is there anything that you would like to tell me since you have summoned me here today?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I asked you here to accompany me to talk and to relieve my boredom. I have not much longer to live. Under normal circumstances, I don’t think it will be more than twenty years!” The Old Ancestor chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor’s words had truly given Qing Shui a shock. But after hearing the later part of the conversations, he felt a bit better. If it didn’t exceed twenty years, that meant that he would at least have fifteen years left under normal circumstances. Fifteen years was already considered to be enough. It would have been sufficient for him to do many things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I still hope that you will take over the Heavenly Palace.” The Old Ancestor said in a calm manner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor, haven’t we talked about it before? Let’s give it a bit more time. You too have seen that I am really not qualified for the position just yet.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I already expected you to say that. Can’t you let me rest in peace?” The Old Ancestor smiled bitterly as he looked towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“But I am still absolutely unable to suppress the Heavenly Palace at the moment. I fear that by then, I am going to disappoint you yet again.” Qing Shui would definitely not blindly promise him. Or else, when the time came, he wouldn’t even be aware of how he died.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright then, ten years, I will give you ten years. After ten years, if you have grown strong enough, take over the Heavenly Palace.” At this moment, the Old Ancestor looked towards Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt really reluctant. When it came to playing mind games, Qing Shui would never be able to beat the Old Ancestor even if there had been ten of him. Since he has already put it that way, it would be impossible for Qing Shui to reject his request. But if he were to accept it, for him to be the “Old Ancestor” of the Heavenly Palace, this &nbsp;would be a nail on an iron panel.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, but I have a request. My request is that within these ten years, if Old Ancestor were to find anyone more suitable than me, let that person replace me as the person to take over the Heavenly Palace. And also, even if I am able to successfully take over the Heavenly Palace in the future, I want to still be able to pass on the seats to people who are more suitable for it.” Said Qing Shui after looking at the Grand Ancestor and thinking for a while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s goal was the World of the Nine Continents. Qing Shui thought that he might not have time to take care of the Heavenly Palace in the future. Hence, he has already prepared a way to retreat for himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, after you take over the Heavenly Palace, it would be up to you what you want to do. Even if it means dismissing the Heavenly Palace. So, you can do all of these things just fine.” The Grand Ancestor chuckled and said calmly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was speechless. From the way he put it, Qing Shui was a Heavenly Palace disciple. Hence, after he took over the Heavenly Palace, it would mean he associated himself to Heavenly Palace. Him dismissing the Heavenly Palace? What a joke! Who would want to let themselves carry this kind of infamy? Hence, once he took over the Heavenly Palace in the future, he would have to be really cautious when looking for people to replace him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was cautious even when it was about looking for a person to take over his position.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has to admit that the Old Ancestor was really thorough when it came to analysing people. He had never wanted to contend for the Green Cloud Continent, nor did he want to contend for the World of the Nine Continents. But he himself held a really strong sense of responsibility. The Old Ancestor was sure that Qing Shui would be able to do a good job…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui let out a sigh and said powerlessly: “Alright, I promise you. Ten years, after ten years, if I have enough strength and Old Ancestor is still yet to find any suitable candidate, I promise you that I will take over the Heavenly Palace.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Said the Old Ancestor while he laughed in joy. After that, he took out a necklace from his clothes and passed it to Qing Shui. The most eye-catching feature of the necklace was the shining dark jewel on top of it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is for you. It might be of help to you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a really gentle light. It felt like a dream and also like an illusion. It was sparklingly black and seemed like it possessed a kind of demonic power. It was so beautiful to the point that it made people felt reluctant to look away from it. It was the first time Qing Shui realized that a black gem could actually be so beautiful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After hesitating for a while, Qing Shui took the necklace: “Thank you Old Ancestor!”</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 483 - All demoness exudes feminine charm. A ten years promise</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Jin Guyao finished speaking, she looked at Qing Shui in agony: “Little brother……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s enough!” Qing Shui immediately interrupted Jin Guyao. He didn’t even bother to look at her. He extended his arm to stop the enraged Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who is she? I don’t care who she is. In short, no one is allowed to bully her, including you!” Until this moment only did Qing Shui look at the bewildered Jin Guyao who was standing there.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As a mistress from Jin Clan, she has always been spoiled by other people. People would always feel reluctant to berate her. Adding on to the fact that she had a face as beautiful as a flower, she would only receive compliments and blessings everywhere she went.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She has never felt this wronged before. All that she did was just defend herself from the woman. In fact, it was the woman who started criticizing her. Who would have thought that he would actually get angry at her for that woman?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Prior to this, hasn’t he always been defending her? Even at the time when her grandpa criticized her, he still tried to fight back for her. So why would he behave like this now?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is that the girl that he liked?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Guyao! Mind your language!” At this moment, Jin Changzheng could tell that Qing Shui has really gotten angry. He quickly told Jin Guyao off.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The reason he came today was to build up a good relationship with Qing Shui. Originally, he had thought that Qing Shui was interested in his sister. Furthermore, at the time when his sister acted recklessly, not only did Qing Shui didn’t blame her, he even tried to defend her for it. That was why he didn’t say anything this time. It’s just that he didn’t expect him to turn over them so soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a limit to the number of times to which Qing Shui could tolerate her. Previously, it was because she did it in front of the elders in Jin Clan. Besides, her headstrong behavior was only at the level of a girl throwing a tantrum. But now, she had gone too far and it made Qing Shui felt disgusted. Qing Shui has always despised this kind of spoiled girl. This kind of temper and attitude had made Qing Shui feel that there was a huge difference between her and the women around him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you like her? Which part of her is better than me?” Jin Guyao asked Qing Shui as she pointed at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui felt that this woman was totally unreasonable when she lost her mind. It gave people the impression that he was discarding something once it lost its uses. He knitted his brows in disgust as he looked at the woman who, to Qing Shui, was beautiful from the outside but ugly on the inside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt that there wasn’t any feminine qualities of her which could move his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It has always been said that women needed to be gentle like a clear pond and also lively like ripples.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sometimes, women couldn’t just rely on their looks. A perfect woman was a woman who could make people fall for them by relying on their personality.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s not that a woman who was capable of making a man neglect their beauty and love them for life wasn’t beautiful. It’s just that they could make the man not put too much emphasis on their beauty. A woman who could cause a ripple in a man’s heart only through their eyes and every single one of their actions and words. This was the true definition of a beautiful woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though this woman looked really young from her appearance. This woman who was slightly older than Qing Shui had made Qing Shui felt that there wasn’t anything good that could make him admire her other than her cultivation level and her decent-looking face.She could only be considered as an average vase.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though a vase was beautiful, it was really brittle. It wouldn’t be able to bear the destruction brought about by time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hence, Qing Shui felt that women didn’t just need to look beautiful. It’s more important that they were self-restrained and ladylike. However, a good personality, a feminine side and the ability to restrain themselves were not something that could be developed so easily. Without a certain amount of understanding towards culture, life experience as well as a certain amount of training, it would be tough to prepare a dish with an intoxicating flavor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Normally, things like this shouldn’t happen for a family like Jin Clan. However, Qing Shui thought that it might be that Jin Guyao has just been spoiled too much since she was small.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She hasn’t experienced anything significant. She could get whatever she wanted. She never lacked compliments and assistance from other people. Furthermore, wherever she went, she would receive flowers and applause. If it hadn’t been because Jin Clan was powerful, she would have ended up as a slave in some unknown people’s back garden.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, I like her, and also, she is better than you in every aspect.” At this moment, Qing Shui said in an ordinary manner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without anyone noticing, Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji as well as Mingyue Gelou who was carrying Yu Chong have already left. At this moment, only a few youngsters remained at the doorway. The surrounding atmosphere wasn’t really good.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Guyao……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, today, I want to know which aspects of her is better than me. Don't tell me that she looks more beautiful than me, I don't think that I would be inferior to her in terms of that.” When Jin Guyao started being unruly, she wouldn't listen to even Jin Changzheng.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, you really want to hear?” Said Qing Shui while he knitted his brows.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I want to hear. I want to see if you can manage to convince me with it.” Jin Guyao looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Actually, do you know that you don't look pretty to me at all? Do you know what features a beautiful woman is supposed to have?” Qing Shui noticed that there was no need for him to get angry with the woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao stared at Qing Shui in shock: “ I don't look pretty? Which part of me doesn't look pretty? My face? Eyes? Nose? Or hands?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“All the features that you just mentioned, how long would it last? Twenty years? Fifty years?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“But without the medicines which could halt people from aging, who would be able to stay young their entire life?” Jin Guyao had obviously piqued an interest in Qing Shui’s words.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“One of the most important features of a beautiful woman is a kind heart. Only with a kind heart will a woman look beautiful in other people’s eyes.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“And?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“And being ladylike!” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is it the fragrant smell on a woman’s body? I have that too!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao words almost made Qing Shui pass out. An uncivilized woman was truly terrifying. For a woman like this, even if they had looked more beautiful, they would still only make men interested in their body. Other than that, the men wouldn't be interested in any more of their stuffs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A ladylike woman. It describes a woman who is gentle like a clear pond and yet can also be lively like ripples. Every woman has their most gentle side. They are like water and honey, mist and fog. Each and every one of her actions, the way she extends her back, the way she combs her hair, each and every one of it, are like rippling waters. A woman’s smile is a half-blossomed flower. Within it flows a picturesque charm.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words immediately stunned a few women.It might be because there weren't many women who were able to admit that they could do it even though they were able to feel these words. Despite that, among the people who was present, there were still people who were capable of doing it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A woman with a gentle posture, black hair straight like waterfall and skin pale like snow. A pair of amorous eyes as calm as lakewater and a smile as beautiful as roses, her feminine side would strike directly onto one’s face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were like lily flowers that quietly blossomed in the lakewater under the moonlight. A woman like this was a radiant woman. A woman who was as gentle as water, a woman who was fair and considerate.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For an unkind woman, even if she was devastatingly beautiful, even if she possessed talents that stood out, she still wouldn’t be a cute and outstanding woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled the memories of the ladylike women that he encountered in the past and also his experiences of being a human for two lives. At this moment, he no longer wanted to have anything to do with this spoiled woman. Qing Shui disliked the woman who always put herself above everything else.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Jin, it’s fine, you guys can leave now, I still have things that I need to do.” Qing Shui smiled as he interrupted Jin Changzheng’s words.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The way people act, whether they were friendly or unfriendly, depends on whether one was successful. But until now, Qing Shui still failed to understand Jin Clan’s actions. Actually, it would have been really easy for Jin Clan to set up a good impression to him. However, they found it unnecessary to do so. Perhaps, they might have overlooked this issue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Who said that aristocratic clans would often be far-sighted?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui has intended to be friends with Jin Clan. After all, it was easy to find friends, but it's difficult to find those who knew you well. It’s already such a rare opportunity to be friends with them, let alone being soulmates!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In any case, Qing Shui couldn’t figure out why Jin Clan was like this. But now, he was finally aware that Jin Clan was trying to seek contact with him for their own benefits. It’s just that would he act so lowly as to accept their offer?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, grandpa has prepared dinner for you. He has also prepared a special gift which you will definitely like.” When Jin Changzheng saw Qing Shui didn't say anything, he spoke quickly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let's go back!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pulled both Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue and went inside with them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, what shall we do?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Jin Guyao looked at Jin Changzheng. She looked a bit worried. Today’s incident was almost ruined because of her unruliness. Every time Jin Guyao thought about it, she would feel hurt and mad at herself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She remembered that she was an unkind and foolish woman in Qing Shui’s heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What made him have the right to say so?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, Huoyun Liu-Li was really happy. She hugged one of Qing Shui’s arm and from time to time, she would look at Qing Shui. She felt extremely elated deep in her heart. She heard Qing Shui said that he liked her and that she was better than that woman in every aspect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Previously, Jin Guyao’s words had already made her really furious. When Huoyun Liu-Li met a woman like this, she got so mad that she didn’t even have the energy to argue with her. But at the instant when Qing Shui stood up for her, Huoyun Liu-Li felt really good.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From time to time, she would look at Qing Shui. She also noticed that he didn’t look unhappy. On the contrary, he had a trace of faint smile on his face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Say whatever you want. Don’t restrain yourself.” Qing Shui noticed Huoyun Liu-Li has been hesitating to speak for quite a while. He could already figure out what kind of questions she wanted to ask judging by how much he knew her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, is sister ladylike?” Huoyun Liu-Li laughed happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li! What kind of nonsense are you saying?” Canghai Mingyue blushed as she looked angrily at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course she is, she smells exceptionally good……” Said Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words made Canghai Mingyue lower her head slightly. It reminded her of the words Qing Shui said to her yesterday. Was that a confession? And this scoundrel……. She felt really weird but at the same time really happy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then am I……” Huoyun Liu-Li mumbled like she was hiding something &nbsp;when she was asking this question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw Huoyun Liu-Li’s expression, he really wanted to laugh. After all, she was still a woman, she still had a shy side. Normally, this kind of time was the time when they tend to be more frail.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui was planning to tease her. But now, he was aware that it’s not an appropriate time for him to do it anymore.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Little brat, since when have you become so uncertain about yourself? You are a demoness, all demoness are very ladylike.” Qing Shui chuckled as he pinched her pink and soft cheek.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Go away! Don’t pinch my cheeks.” Huoyun Liu-Li said angrily. After that, she happily extended her arm pinched Qing Shui’s face back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the afternoon, Qing Shui went to Elder Xing to retrieve the materials of the Tigon Beast Champion. It was already tidied up. One whole bundle of Beast Parchment with only very little Beast Blood. Even though the majority of the blood has flowed out, he still managed to collect a few jars of it. There were also some Beast Bones and Beast Tendons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui has finally gotten his materials for Talisman Drawings. He reckoned that if other Talisman Drawers found out that Qing Shui was learning Talisman Drawings and that he was using a high-grade Demonic Beast Parchment to learn refining, they would most likely be so surprised to the point they dropped their eyeballs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui straight away put all of the things into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the middle of the day, there was a person who came to Qing Shui and informed him that the Old Ancestor was looking for him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly. He once again visited &nbsp;the stone mountain. He saw the Old Ancestor standing on the stone mountain looking into the distance, it was unknown if he was looking at the boundless sky or contemplating.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He turned around slowly when Qing Shui arrived on the stone mountain and looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I greet Old Ancestor!” Qing Shui bowed down and saluted him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘Hehe, alright, alright!” The Old Ancestor laughed happily when he saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed the back of his head. He knew that the Old Ancestor would surely try to convince him about something.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor, is there anything that you would like to tell me since you have summoned me here today?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I asked you here to accompany me to talk and to relieve my boredom. I have not much longer to live. Under normal circumstances, I don’t think it will be more than twenty years!” The Old Ancestor chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor’s words had truly given Qing Shui a shock. But after hearing the later part of the conversations, he felt a bit better. If it didn’t exceed twenty years, that meant that he would at least have fifteen years left under normal circumstances. Fifteen years was already considered to be enough. It would have been sufficient for him to do many things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I still hope that you will take over the Heavenly Palace.” The Old Ancestor said in a calm manner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor, haven’t we talked about it before? Let’s give it a bit more time. You too have seen that I am really not qualified for the position just yet.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I already expected you to say that. Can’t you let me rest in peace?” The Old Ancestor smiled bitterly as he looked towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“But I am still absolutely unable to suppress the Heavenly Palace at the moment. I fear that by then, I am going to disappoint you yet again.” Qing Shui would definitely not blindly promise him. Or else, when the time came, he wouldn’t even be aware of how he died.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright then, ten years, I will give you ten years. After ten years, if you have grown strong enough, take over the Heavenly Palace.” At this moment, the Old Ancestor looked towards Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt really reluctant. When it came to playing mind games, Qing Shui would never be able to beat the Old Ancestor even if there had been ten of him. Since he has already put it that way, it would be impossible for Qing Shui to reject his request. But if he were to accept it, for him to be the “Old Ancestor” of the Heavenly Palace, this &nbsp;would be a nail on an iron panel.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, but I have a request. My request is that within these ten years, if Old Ancestor were to find anyone more suitable than me, let that person replace me as the person to take over the Heavenly Palace. And also, even if I am able to successfully take over the Heavenly Palace in the future, I want to still be able to pass on the seats to people who are more suitable for it.” Said Qing Shui after looking at the Grand Ancestor and thinking for a while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s goal was the World of the Nine Continents. Qing Shui thought that he might not have time to take care of the Heavenly Palace in the future. Hence, he has already prepared a way to retreat for himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, after you take over the Heavenly Palace, it would be up to you what you want to do. Even if it means dismissing the Heavenly Palace. So, you can do all of these things just fine.” The Grand Ancestor chuckled and said calmly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was speechless. From the way he put it, Qing Shui was a Heavenly Palace disciple. Hence, after he took over the Heavenly Palace, it would mean he associated himself to Heavenly Palace. Him dismissing the Heavenly Palace? What a joke! Who would want to let themselves carry this kind of infamy? Hence, once he took over the Heavenly Palace in the future, he would have to be really cautious when looking for people to replace him.</p>

The Old Ancestor was sure that Qing Shui would be able to do a good job…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui let out a sigh and said powerlessly: “Alright, I promise you. Ten years, after ten years, if I have enough strength and Old Ancestor is still yet to find any suitable candidate, I promise you that I will take over the Heavenly Palace.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Said the Old Ancestor while he laughed in joy. After that, he took out a necklace from his clothes and passed it to Qing Shui. The most eye-catching feature of the necklace was the shining dark jewel on top of it.</p>
