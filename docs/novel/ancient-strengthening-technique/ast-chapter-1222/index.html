 <p>AST 1222 - Success of the Sixty Four Star. Golden Yang Wolf, Victory.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood still on the arena. The thing which he said made Fu Yanting a bit surprised. But very quickly, he smiled, “Sure, why not? I don’t think an arm is enough. Why don’t we bet on two instead?”</p>
 <p>“I think that will be a great idea,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Now, a lot of the people below the arena were all having their own discussions. Fu Yanting was quite a famous figure within the Heaven Secrets Academy. Normally, people wouldn’t dare to provoke him. Not only did he have powerful martial brothers, he himself was also considered to be quite formidable.</p>
 <p>Not every person who talked big was useless. A real good-for-nothing person would still have something which he could boast about. Merely the family background or the people behind their back were not enough to make someone arrogant. Well at the very least, they wouldn’t be able to stay that way for long.</p>
 <p>It might have seemed like Qing Shui stood out without thinking carefully about the consequences. But he didn’t actually do it out of rage after being pointed at by someone and being called trash. Naturally, logically, he would feel that way. But right now, the reason he stood out wasn’t because of this. Qing Shui was confident that he would be able to handle him even now.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess had already broken through. Besides, the battle this time was witnessed by a lot of people. Even if there were people who had wanted to do bad things to him, they would have to think twice before doing so. Heaven Secrets Academy might be loose with its rules but it still had discipline. There were a few rules which were stated clearly by the academy itself. Firstly, one could never bully someone else just because they were weak. Secondly, they were not allowed to attempt to win a battle with numbers. Last but not least, one could never kill someone through dirty methods like poison or assasination.</p>
 <p>Even though there were a lot of issues regarding these modern laws, it was just as stated above, things would be fine as long as no one noticed it. It was also because of this that Qing Shui wasn’t worried. Since they had wanted to deal with him in secret, it was impossible for them to make such a huge crowd appear. Furthermore, his level didn’t manage to force them to send out their strongest candidates. By the time they realized his true strength, everything would have been too late.</p>
 <p>Hu Yiya had already gone down. On his way up to the arena, Qing Shui passed her some Golden Medicinal Salve Powder and whispered to her, “This is something brother told me to give you.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Let’s start. I will give you the initiative to attack,” Fu yanting said generously.</p>
 <p>“Sure, I won’t be polite then.”</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui finished speaking, he operated his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. At the moment he swung his Big Dipper Sword, the surroundings got covered in ocean.</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>He didn’t want to constantly rely on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. If he had summoned it, he definitely would be able to instantly defeat the core disciple. Or rather, even people who were stronger than core disciples. However, that would influence his strength from growing. He wouldn’t use it unless it was absolutely needed.</p>
 <p>Water Binding Force, Monstrous Wave, Toppling Mountains and Oceans!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continuously swung the Big Dipper Sword in his hand. He also began operating the Divine Nebula Formation. As these things happened, it was as if his entire body was right in the middle of an enormous catastrophe. The moment the battle started, both sides had already gone up into the air.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Fu Yanting were surrounded by a vast ocean. Enormous waves could be seen constantly assaulting them. However, it was unable to make its way to within three meters within Fu Yanting. There was a faint invisible halo around him, blocking the waves and the killing intentions in the surroundings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t feel surprised. Fu Yanting ought to have something mysterious with him, perhaps, maybe even mysterious martial techniques. Just like himself, he had a lot of secrets not known by other people. The others would also have it. Actually, every individual would have their own secrets. The only difference was the level of the secret. But they all shared one similarity, since it had already been said that it was a secret, they would definitely not want anyone to find out about it. A secret would no longer be a secret once someone found out about it.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, if this is all that you’re capable of, then today, it’s already been decided that you will lose both your arms.” Fu Yanting could be seen shuttling through the wave. In every spot where he passed, the waves around him would retreat back like a falling tide.</p>
 <p>Roaming Dragon Steps!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Inside the enormous wave, Qing Shui was like a deep sea dragon. He carried a powerful aura with him. That was a combination of both tyranny and quick-wittedness. Following his increase in strength, the power of his footworks had also become a lot stronger. His strength was the foundation for all of his martial techniques and postures. Brute strength was enough to destroy all skills. In front of absolute strength, everything was meaningless.</p>
 <p>Certainly, Fu Yanting hasn’t reached the extent where he could destroy Qing Shui’s skills with brute strength. From this movement, one could already tell that if Fu Yanting didn’t have powerful killing techniques, he wouldn’t even be able to even drag on the fight.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was aware that he would need to use the fastest and most tyrannical method to face off against opponents like this. He needed to make him felt completely disheartened and unable to face the reality.</p>
 <p>A 20% reduction in strength was absolutely sufficient to make Fu Yanting cry. Before he managed to recover from shock, Qing Shui had already proceeded to land another hit with his Big Dipper Sword. He also swiftly tossed out his Primordial Flame Dragon Whip. These sorts of whips were almost a match to Qing Shui’s previous martial arts motions. He right away whipped it towards Fu Yanting.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Standing in front of an enormous power with terrifying strength, Fu Yanting was put in a difficult situation and gave his all in avoiding them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He had forgotten that there was already a significant improvement in his strength. Now, his raw strength was already worth around forty seven nimbus. Naturally, its strength would be a lot stronger than before. Fu Yanting was only a core disciple, he was not qualified for Qing Shui to even keep in his eyes. He once again swung the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Ninth Heavenly Lotus Confinement!</p>
 <p>An enormous petal which looked like a lotus which had just bloomed appeared. It was shining with bright light and in just a short while, it had already surrounded Fu Yanting at its center. However, Fu Yanting struggled inside the petal. The golden petal shook vigorously, causing Qing Shui to feel rattled. He was sure that Fu Yanting would have something which could resist it, maybe even something which he could use to reflect spirit energy attacks.</p>
 <p>Divine Nebula Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui abruptly arranged the nebula within his sea of consciousness. It was just that its vigorous movement this time stunned Qing Shui for a moment. He had tried more than a hundred thousand times in arranging the sixty fourth star with little to no success. Previously, he subconsciously arranged the sixty fourth star using the Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation but at the instant he moved it, he felt as if his entire body completely burst open.</p>
 <p>It actually succeeded at a time like this?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t have time to feel the changes within his body. He immediately activated the Divine Nebula Formation, without having a clue on whether he was activating the Seven-Seven or Eight-Eight Divine Nebula Formation. After that, an enormous palm appeared above Fu Yanting. Seven enormous palms merged into one in an instant. Furthermore, Qing Shui saw the picture of a nebula on top of the enormous palm. It was a profound eight trigram picture of the nebula.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui abruptly pressed down the “One Hand Cover Sky”.</p>
 <p>A look of dispair flashed across Fu Yanting’s eyes. A white light emerged from his body. This time, it was even brighter than those before, so much so that the light itself began to look a bit dense as if it was very concentrated.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui witnessed this, he operated his spirit energy all the way to its maximum and pressed it down not holding back at all.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>An enormous noise came through. The heart of the stage was in a completely twisted and destroyed state. In there, even divine iron would be ripped into pieces. Even though Fu Yanting had the white light to protect himself, he still got blown away quite miserably. He even spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted up his steps and slowly made his way towards Fu Yanting.</p>
 <p>After that, he slowly lifted up his hand and once again formed the motion of One Hand Cover Sky.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, you’re the one who forced me to do this. Don’t blame me for it. Come out, Golden Sun Wolf!” A ruthless look flashed across Fu Yanting’s eyes. He once again retreated. As he did that, an enormous wolf in golden scaled armor with a size of a hundred meters appeared. After that, it shot out a mouthful of True Yang Flame into the sky. Those were all fireballs. They immediately bombarded Qing Shui’s enormous palm imprint in rapid succession.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. That was a Golden Sun Wolf. He had seen information about this demonic beast from the demonic beast intel which he happened to come across not long ago. The Golden Yang Wolf was a pet wolf of the sun. They cultivated the Sun Immersion Technique and also the Golden Yang Pellet. All of their attacks contained the True Yang Force. Not only was their True Yang Fire powerful, they also possessed terrifying physical strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed the opponent’s demonic beast. It should be in a state where it was almost going to reach adulthood. However, in terms of strength, it should be almost as strong as the fire baby dragon.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui had relied on himself, it was very likely that even protecting himself would also be a problem. He still didn’t have any idea on how the Eight-Eight Divine Nebula Formation was doing. But he was able to feel a profound and mysterious strength from his “One Hand Cover Sky” from before. It felt as if there was nothing which it couldn’t overcome. But at this moment, that enormous Golden Sun Wolf on the opposite side was already charging towards him at an unusually fast speed. Most importantly, this demonic beast was very intelligent. Other than both of the wolf’s eyes looking fierce, there was also a kind of deceitful look to it.</p>
 <p>It was an extremely cunning beast.</p>
 <p>……………….</p>
 <p>“Golden Yang Wolf, Fu Yanting is indeed blessed with luck. To think that he would have a brother like the Saint Child. Prior to this, I have only heard that for his safety, the Saint Child used a high grade Sacred Beast Pill to help him tame the Golden Yang Wolf.” Everyone from below screamed in shock when the Golden Yang Wolf showed up.</p>
 <p>“The Saint Child could accomplish this easily. But to us, it was something which we would never be able to achieve even if we have spent our lifetimes working hard.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t feel sad anymore. Who is this young man? To think that he is able to beat Fu Yanting. Unfortunately, Fu Yanting is someone with personality, he will absolutely not let go of this young man so easily. I feel that this young man might end up getting killed by mistake.” At the moment when this man mentioned the words “killed by mistake”, he clenched his teeth particularly hard.</p>
 <p>“Hai, this young man is also considered another super genius. This is such a waste.”</p>
 <p>“Geniuses are meant to fall. Every day, there are a lot of geniuses parting with this world. The smarter one is, the higher the chance they die young. However, for all you know, this young man might come up with a surprising killer weapon of his own. After all, considering that he is this strong, he must have had a very powerful backing as well. For all you know, it might be even stronger than the forces behind Fu Yanting.”</p>
 <p>“It’s hard but I do hope that this young man will defeat Fu Yanting.”</p>
 <p>……..</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to let loose. In any case, he was no match for the Golden Yang Wolf, hence, he summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant right away. A noise resembling the enormous grunt of a dragon as well as the trumpet of an elephant was heard. After that, the dragon elephant immediately stood in front of the Golden Sun Wolf.</p>
 <p>The Golden Yang Wolf chickened out. But indeed, Qing Shui wouldn’t hold back just because of that.</p>
 <p>Kill! Qing Shui gave the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant the order to kill the Golden Yang Wolf. If he was not mistaken, it was very likely that the Golden Yang Wolf had done a lot of bad things before.</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant locked onto the Golden Yang Wolf with a bloody red colored sword qi.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion, Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack!</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui coordinated himself with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and let off a series of continuous violent attacks. Their strength differed by one fold or more. After getting weakened even further, even if the Golden Yang Wolf had been a Mutated Species of Heaven and Earth, it also got bombarded to death right away. Only after that did Qing Shui make the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant stare at Fu Yanting.</p>
 <p>“I admit defeat!”</p>
 <p>Fu Yanting screamed quickly.</p>
 <p>“Sure, break off both of your arms youself. Or would you prefer I do it?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Brother, everyone makes mistakes, you should learn to forgive them whenever possible. What I said just a moment ago was just a joke. We’re both people from Heaven Secret Academy, there’s no point in stressing one another,” Fu Yanting said seriously in an noble manner.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Qing Shui saw a person with such a thick face. A lot of people from below had long since started criticizing him. Qing Shui responded slowly, “Since we have already agreed on it prior, you should be responsible and admit defeat. I will let my dragon elephant help you with it.”</p>
 <p>“Prior to this, we’re just speaking without really thinking matters through. Do you have evidence? Can you find any witnesses?”</p>
