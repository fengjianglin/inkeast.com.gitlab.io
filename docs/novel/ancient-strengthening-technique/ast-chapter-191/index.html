  <p><strong>AST 191 – So, Goddess also needed to wear panties.</strong></p>
  <p>“Covering the blankets myself feels off somehow. Seems like I have to borrow a few more blankets from Master.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui snickered as he walked in the direction of Yiye’s room. Next to the grand hall was a small courtyard with a pavilion in it. Yiye Jiange was staying in this pavilion, which had two levels to it.</p>
  <p>Because Qing Shui had seen the silhouette of Yiye’s extraordinary and refined figure there, he was extremely familiar to the scene as he stepped up on the pavilion.</p>
  <p>On the moment he entered, he realised that the stairs were actually made from wood, and had a rustic feel to it. The light green colour of the stairs was exceptionally beautiful. Qing Shui couldn’t help but shake his head, lamenting the fact that Luan Luan had always been carried by Yiye Jiange into this pavilion while this was the first time he was here.</p>
  <p>There was one night the little lass called out from above, “Daddy, come up. Let’s sleep together with Auntie.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui almost exploded in excitement only to have hot tears wetting his eyes a moment later. This little lass was such an angel, not forgetting him no matter where and when the occasion was.</p>
  <p>Pushing open the door, he saw a small living hall appear. This place was different from that of Huoyun Liu-Li’s. The living hall of Yiye Jiange was designed with simplicity in mind. There were two rows of snow-white sofas, matching white walls, and white floor boards. The whole room was also free of dust.</p>
  <p>One loved the colour purple, while the other loved white. It was the same for their dressing styles. Yiye Jiange loved to dress up the girl in snow white, and luckily, the little girl looked so adorable and pretty in white.</p>
  <p>Other than the two sofas, there were also a few white colored wardrobes that were lined up together. Qing Shui slowly approached the bedroom as his heartbeat grew increasingly faster!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui silently scolded himself for being useless as he walked towards the bedroom. He was merely entering the bedroom of a beautiful girl, so why was he so agitated? How useless.<br></p>
  <p>After pushing open the bedroom door, Qing Shui felt very calm as he surveyed the room. The bedroom was very small, to the extent where there was only a single bed and a wardrobe in there.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The size of the bed was also quite small, insufficient for two people to sleep there. The covers and blankets of the bed were neat and tidy without the slightest bit of wrinkles.</p>
  <p>As he approached the bed, a faint lingering trace of aroma drifted into his nose. Qing Shui enjoyed himself and breathed in deeply, “Hmm, the same smell as my goddess master.”</p>
  <p>“Forget it, I shall just grab any random two pieces of blanket!”</p>
  <p>As he took away the two pieces of blankets and prepared to leave, he caught sight of something that caused his countenance to freeze. There was a white-coloured panties stuck inside the blankets…</p>
  <p>So, even a Goddess also needed to wear panties………….</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s eyes were already glued onto that piece of white panties, and no matter what he did, he wasn’t able to shift his gaze away. The material seemed kind of flimsy, and was filled with a seductive aura. Holding the two blankets with one hand, Qing Shui gingerly reached out his other hand towards the panties.</p>
  <p>After touching it, Qing Shui felt extremely excited. The material was so smooth, and had a fragrance to it. This aroma was the same one as his goddess master and as well as her bedroom.</p>
  <p>After being stunned for a second, Qing Shui felt that he was extremely wretched. He had totally lost control earlier. After coming to his senses, he quickly put the panties back on the bed before he ran away with extreme speed from the pavilion.</p>
  <p>After returning to his own room, he discovered that Shi Qingzhuang was still sleeping. Qing Shui covered more blankets on her, and then went inside his spatial realm to grab a turtle.</p>
  <p>The All Aspect Nourishment Soup!</p>
  <p>The All Aspect Nourishment Soup was able to nurture and boost the power of a man’s weapon. At the same time, it was also able to nourish the body, and was especially good for people who were injured. That was why Qing Shui prepared the All Aspect Nourishment Soup as a tonic for Shi Qingzhuang to recuperate.</p>
  <p>The moment Qing Shui started cooking, Shi Qingzhuang awoke. As she saw Qing Shui and the blankets covering her body, she extended her hands, wanting to lift up the blankets!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui hurried over, “Let me do it, let me do it!”</p>
  <p>After lifting up the blankets for her, Qing Shui gazed tenderly at Shi Qingzhuang, “No matter what you want to do, let me help you.”</p>
  <p>Shi Qingzhuang had an unnatural reddish glow upon her face.</p>
  <p>“Oh, I know. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Let me help you.” Qing Shui carried Shi Qingzhuang and walked towards another room.</p>
  <p>“I will help myself! You go out first.” Shi Qingzhuang lowered her head, not daring to look at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Look how serious your injuries are, don’t struggle. Anyways, which part of your body have I not seen before?” As Qing Shui removed her skirts, Shi Qingzhuang was so shy now that she immediately duck her head into Qing Shui’s embrace.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s hands would inadvertently come into contact with some forbidden places. However, Qing Shui knew that Shi Qingzhuang was also injured. Hence, he didn’t try to touch her inappropriately.</p>
  <p>However, the smoothness of her skin caused his heart to itch. Waiting for a long time after not hearing any sounds, Qing Shui spoke, “Qingzhuang, is there something wrong? You can’t urinate? Qing Shui half-carried her, as he whispered into her ears laughing.</p>
  <p>“You being here, I can’t uri…” The bashful sound of Shi Qingzhuang’s voice whispered, filling with extreme charm.</p>
  <p>“Just relax…”</p>
  <p>“You are not allowed to look or listen…”</p>
  <p>After a very long moment, the sound of pitter-patter finally sounded out. Shi Qingzhuang was so shy that she refused to look at Qing Shui as he carried her back to her bed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui used a wet towel to wipe her face and hands while the usually ice-cool face of Shi Qingzhuang was filled with a tinge of red from her shyness.</p>
  <p>A moment later, that mesmerizing fragrance drifted out. As Shi Qingzhuang smelled the fragrance, her face was akin to being lit up by the purest rays of sunshine. The redness of her face was extremely apparent. She recalled the time back when she and Qing Shui just had their first taste of the opposite sex. Qing Shui also cooked this soup for her; the smell of this soup was unforgettable.</p>
  <p>The soup was not the only thing unforgettable as every time she recalled that scenario, she would feel her cheeks grow burning hot. Why did she take the initiative back then, and actually do such a bashful thing…?</p>
  <p>Would he think that she was easy and that she was not a good woman…?</p>
  <p>“What are you thinking about? Why are you so lost?” Qing Shui brought a huge bowl of Nourishment Soup over, as he smiled lightly.</p>
  <p>Shi Qingzhuang was shaken awake by the words of Qing Shui. After which, she saw Qing Shui carry the bowl of soup over to her bedside. He blew gently on the soup after he scooped a spoonful.</p>
  <p>Looking at the soup in front of her, Shi Qingzhuang shyly asked, “Do you think I’m easy?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui dumbly stared at Shi Qingzhuang. He didn’t know what came over her after half a day, “Why do you ask this? What are you talking about?”</p>
  <p>“You keep on harping about that thing we did… and said that I…destroyed you. Do you look down on women like that? I was drugged that time.” Shi Qingzhuang was almost in tears as she gritted her teeth and completed the sentence. The shyness on her face made Qing Shui think that she was extremely adorable.</p>
  <p>“I thought about what were you asking… Oh, you mean that? Well, you were indeed a bit barbaric to me after that, but… I loved it. I love the fact that you are only barbaric to me.” Qing Shui laughed as he brought the spoonful of soup near the sexy mouth of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>“You bad egg, bad man, and bad thing!” Shi Qingzhuang murmured in a low voice before drinking that spoonful of soup.</p>
  <p>“Qingzhuang. Ah, let your lord husband teach you about the birds and the bees.” Qing Shui fed her soup while explaining.</p>
  <p>Shi Qingzhuang tactfully remained silent!</p>
  <p>“There was a man, even though he’s cheap. There would also be some woman who would treat him well. However, he didn’t like them, and only showed interest in those women who ignored him. Not only that, he also said that a wife cannot be comparable to a concubine, and a concubine cannot be compared to a woman he stole from others. Doing it with people’s wives were the greatest and brought him an incomparable amount of excitement.” As Qing Shui spoke to her, Shi Qingzhuang’s eyes widened and was filled with suspicions and doubtfulness.</p>
  <p>“Oh, I’m talking about the hearts of other men. I’m a good man. Okay, don’t interrupt me. Just listen to me finish speaking, and eat while you listen to me.” Qing Shui fed another spoonful of the Nourishment Soup into the sexy mouth of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>“Men actually hope their women would be elegant and beautiful, filled with grace and charm, and equipped with an extraordinary air. It doesn’t matter if they were as cold as ice, and it would even be for the best if other men saw that you actually obtained such an unreachable woman. This is for show, for outside people to see. At home, he would want his woman to be mature, loving, filial, caring for kids, respectful of the elderly, and not flirtatious with other guys. And at night, his woman had to be filled with fiery lust, and unleash her inner demoness. It would be best if she became a horny nympho, the hornier the better.” Qing Shui expertly laughed as he gazed at the bashful Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>After a moment of silence, Qing Shui fed spoonful after spoonful of soup to Shi Qingzhuang. He dipped the spoon into the bowl of soup to feed her again, and again, and again. After finishing that bowl of soup, Qing Shui refilled the bowl and restarted his feeding actions.</p>
  <p>“Do you think I’m a pig?!” Shi Qingzhuang speechlessly pouted.</p>
  <p>“If the pigs in this world were as beautiful as you, why would men still go look for women? They might as well look for a pig.” Qing Shui removed the spoonful of soup that had already entered Shi Qingzhuang’s mouth, and placed it inside his own mouth instead.</p>
  <p>Shi Qingzhuang couldn’t help but have her heartbeat quicken as she saw the spoon that she drank from so many times being sucked by Qing Shui. She thought of the warped logic that Qing Shui had just explained earlier and wondered, “Were any of the things he said true?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui drank a few more bowls. Since the day was still young, he used the energy from the Ancient Strengthening Technique to rejuvenate the wounds of Shi Qingzhuang. The injury was near a navel area with a hole penetrating through. With the mysteriousness of his golden needle techniques, the golden sore ointment, the two drops of blood from the golden medicinal tortoise, and a few small-revitalizing pellets, this injury was nothing to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>As Shi Qingzhuang felt the hands of Qing Shui ‘caressing’ her navel, she didn’t dare meet his gaze, but instead shifted her eyes in another direction!</p>

 <p>Qing Shui’s hands would inadvertently come into contact with some forbidden places. However, Qing Shui knew that Shi Qingzhuang was also injured. Hence, he didn’t try to touch her inappropriately.</p>
 <p>However, the smoothness of her skin caused his heart to itch. Waiting for a long time after not hearing any sounds, Qing Shui spoke, “Qingzhuang, is there something wrong? You can’t urinate? Qing Shui half-carried her, as he whispered into her ears laughing.</p>
 <p>“You being here, I can’t uri…” The bashful sound of Shi Qingzhuang’s voice whispered, filling with extreme charm.</p>
 <p>“Just relax…”</p>
 <p>“You are not allowed to look or listen…”</p>
 <p>After a very long moment, the sound of pitter-patter finally sounded out. Shi Qingzhuang was so shy that she refused to look at Qing Shui as he carried her back to her bed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used a wet towel to wipe her face and hands while the usually ice-cool face of Shi Qingzhuang was filled with a tinge of red from her shyness.</p>
 <p>A moment later, that mesmerizing fragrance drifted out. As Shi Qingzhuang smelled the fragrance, her face was akin to being lit up by the purest rays of sunshine. The redness of her face was extremely apparent. She recalled the time back when she and Qing Shui just had their first taste of the opposite sex. Qing Shui also cooked this soup for her; the smell of this soup was unforgettable.</p>
 <p>The soup was not the only thing unforgettable as every time she recalled that scenario, she would feel her cheeks grow burning hot. Why did she take the initiative back then, and actually do such a bashful thing…?</p>
 <p>Would he think that she was easy and that she was not a good woman…?</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking about? Why are you so lost?” Qing Shui brought a huge bowl of Nourishment Soup over, as he smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>Shi Qingzhuang was shaken awake by the words of Qing Shui. After which, she saw Qing Shui carry the bowl of soup over to her bedside. He blew gently on the soup after he scooped a spoonful.</p>
 <p>Looking at the soup in front of her, Shi Qingzhuang shyly asked, “Do you think I’m easy?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dumbly stared at Shi Qingzhuang. He didn’t know what came over her after half a day, “Why do you ask this? What are you talking about?”</p>
 <p>“You keep on harping about that thing we did… and said that I…destroyed you. Do you look down on women like that? I was drugged that time.” Shi Qingzhuang was almost in tears as she gritted her teeth and completed the sentence. The shyness on her face made Qing Shui think that she was extremely adorable.</p>
 <p>“I thought about what were you asking… Oh, you mean that? Well, you were indeed a bit barbaric to me after that, but… I loved it. I love the fact that you are only barbaric to me.” Qing Shui laughed as he brought the spoonful of soup near the sexy mouth of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>“You bad egg, bad man, and bad thing!” Shi Qingzhuang murmured in a low voice before drinking that spoonful of soup.</p>
 <p>“Qingzhuang. Ah, let your lord husband teach you about the birds and the bees.” Qing Shui fed her soup while explaining.</p>
 <p>Shi Qingzhuang tactfully remained silent!</p>
 <p>“There was a man, even though he’s cheap. There would also be some woman who would treat him well. However, he didn’t like them, and only showed interest in those women who ignored him. Not only that, he also said that a wife cannot be comparable to a concubine, and a concubine cannot be compared to a woman he stole from others. Doing it with people’s wives were the greatest and brought him an incomparable amount of excitement.” As Qing Shui spoke to her, Shi Qingzhuang’s eyes widened and was filled with suspicions and doubtfulness.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I’m talking about the hearts of other men. I’m a good man. Okay, don’t interrupt me. Just listen to me finish speaking, and eat while you listen to me.” Qing Shui fed another spoonful of the Nourishment Soup into the sexy mouth of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>“Men actually hope their women would be elegant and beautiful, filled with grace and charm, and equipped with an extraordinary air. It doesn’t matter if they were as cold as ice, and it would even be for the best if other men saw that you actually obtained such an unreachable woman. This is for show, for outside people to see. At home, he would want his woman to be mature, loving, filial, caring for kids, respectful of the elderly, and not flirtatious with other guys. And at night, his woman had to be filled with fiery lust, and unleash her inner demoness. It would be best if she became a horny nympho, the hornier the better.” Qing Shui expertly laughed as he gazed at the bashful Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>After a moment of silence, Qing Shui fed spoonful after spoonful of soup to Shi Qingzhuang. He dipped the spoon into the bowl of soup to feed her again, and again, and again. After finishing that bowl of soup, Qing Shui refilled the bowl and restarted his feeding actions.</p>
 <p>“Do you think I’m a pig?!” Shi Qingzhuang speechlessly pouted.</p>
 <p>“If the pigs in this world were as beautiful as you, why would men still go look for women? They might as well look for a pig.” Qing Shui removed the spoonful of soup that had already entered Shi Qingzhuang’s mouth, and placed it inside his own mouth instead.</p>
 <p>Shi Qingzhuang couldn’t help but have her heartbeat quicken as she saw the spoon that she drank from so many times being sucked by Qing Shui. She thought of the warped logic that Qing Shui had just explained earlier and wondered, “Were any of the things he said true?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui drank a few more bowls. Since the day was still young, he used the energy from the Ancient Strengthening Technique to rejuvenate the wounds of Shi Qingzhuang. The injury was near a navel area with a hole penetrating through. With the mysteriousness of his golden needle techniques, the golden sore ointment, the two drops of blood from the golden medicinal tortoise, and a few small-revitalizing pellets, this injury was nothing to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>As Shi Qingzhuang felt the hands of Qing Shui ‘caressing’ her navel, she didn’t dare meet his gaze, but instead shifted her eyes in another direction!</p>
