 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s move was too blunt. There wasn’t much of a silhouette nor did he say anything either. He simply attacked quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining people were scared and angered. However, seeing Qing Shui, they couldn’t say anything. The Demon Gate Junior Sect Master wasn’t too far away, furrowing his brow. He was in league with the Five Tiger Immortal Palace, coming and leaving together, but the problem now was that their enemy was extremely strong. One wrong step and they could end up dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A normal person was afraid of death. For those who weren’t, they were just completely disheartened. An example would be an eighty-year-old with a full family that was all killed overnight. It didn’t matter how they died, because the old man was still disheartened in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people were naturally not like that, so now they all hesitated, realizing that they could do nothing against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did you kill him?” One of the men from the Five Tiger Immortal Palace asked Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some times where popping your head out was dangerous, but you still had to do something. There was nothing he could have done in this scenario. They were still people of the Five Tiger Immortal Palace who had received respect from the outside. Other people that met them gave it immediately, or just continued to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in this situation, they had to ask someone something apprehensively, and that person could kill them at his very whim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He was being too annoying like that. I couldn’t take it.” Qing Shui said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made the man a little scared. Whatever type of reason this was, it was just a smack across the face, making the Five Tiger Immortal Palace lose face and forcing them to make a move. But could they even do anything? Their opponent could beat the Blazing Fire Immortal Palace Palace Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strong could massacre the weak, and no matter what the weak did, it was useless. These were the thoughts of the man who was worried that Qing Shui would just casually kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I’m not in the mood to kill people. Just leave!” Qing Shui said casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Gate Junior Sect Master didn’t say anything throughout the entire altercation. Not because he was afraid of saying anything, but instead, it didn’t matter what he said. He had no thoughts on the matter, and if he said anything bad it could make the situation worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you sir, for saving me. I have nothing to offer you as gratitude except for this, which would just cause trouble for us. Since you’re so strong, this gift would be much suited for you.” The two men from before who weren’t hurt gave Qing Shui a gift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the two of them and said, “I’m not here to take anything from you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We know. We have already thought that something like this would happen. Keeping this would only be bad for us,” the man said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are Heavenly Magic Stars, which can increase a type of passive strength of demonic beasts.” The man explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was definitely a good thing. The best part being that it was for the strongest of the demonic beasts, otherwise it would be a waste. Qing Shui furrowed his brow: “It’s good and I do want it, but it’s too important.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It may be important, but it can’t be used if the person using it is dead. Since you have saved my life, though this isn’t much as repayment, I wish to give it to you,” The man was sincere as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also didn’t push the matter anymore, and after accepting it, healed the wounded man’s arm. He then said: “If there’s anything urgent, you can come to the Northern Emperor Domain’s Imperial Cuisine Hall to find me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you sir!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two people were very interesting, not giving any conditions, and not beating around the bush. Qing Shui thought that the character of those two was not bad. After coming around, it was known that Qing Shui had received the gift from those two, whom Qing Shui had helped, so after this no one bothered those two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this, time passed tick by tick and the portal was already open. A lot of people rushed through excitedly, Qing Shui’s crew included.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The time they had been away was about half a month, and the outside was bustling. The Demon Gate, Five Tiger Immortal Palace, Taiyi Immortal Palace, Divine Hall, Blazing Fire Immortal Palace, North Sun, and the rest were there. Qing Shui and his crew went towards the location of the North Sun and Taiyi Immortal Palace, who were together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seems like you guys had success,” Beihuang Liefeng said as he greeted Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was alright,” Qing Shui said with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he went to visit the Senior Golden Battle God, who was happy as he saw Qing Shui. They were descendants of the Battle God, and didn’t need to be worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dad, Qing Shui hurt the Blazing Fire Immortal Palace Palace Lord. Will we be okay?” Beihuang Fan asked because she worried about Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Qing Shui hurt that guy?” Both Beihuang Liefeng and the Senior Golden Battle God said, not believing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, he completely defeated him.” Beihuang Fan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is true. I saw it with my own eyes!” Beihuang Yu saw that the two of them were shocked in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyone who was in there would know, and news of it would be spreading quickly,” the Hill Moving Battle God supported their claims.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Liefeng and the Senior Golden Battle God already believed it in the beginning. They were just in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone then peacefully left. First, they ate a large meal at the Divine Palace, which was the same place as last time. Only this time, it was Qing Shui who was in charge of cooking, which meant that the food was exceptionally good. Originally, Qing Shui had a clinic open underneath, and didn’t know that they could enjoy such good food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, it was Beihuang Liefeng and the Senior Golden Battle God who didn’t know. The rest knew a bit. Both Beihuang Fan and Yu naturally knew, and the Hill Moving Battle God and Diamond both had eaten it, since Qing Shui had cooked a few times in the Yu Royal Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Delicious food couldn’t be eaten continuously as everyone knew, so normally they only ate it every few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Continuing on, Qing Shui and a few of them talked about what happened in the Yu Royal Gate. Hearing the good things that happened made everyone happy, especially Beihuang Liefeng. The atmosphere now was as though Qing Shui was an important person of the Beihuang Family. Beihuang Yu was healed by Qing Shui, and the girl that turned away other men seemed to get along very well with this boy. Even both Beihuang Fan and Yu’s strength had increased drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Liefeng and the Senior Golden Battle God only cared about a few things. As long as their descendants were strong, it didn’t matter what they did. Furthermore, Beihuang Fan and Qing Shui being together wasn’t an accident, something that both of them understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They stayed at the Battle God Palace for a day.
