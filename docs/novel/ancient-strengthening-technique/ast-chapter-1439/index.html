Waiting for you makes me happy,” Qing Shui said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took the opportunity to express his feelings again. He was not certain whether the woman could feel it but he made sure to express himself clearly. She was highly intelligent, but in terms of emotional intellect, Qing Shui was not certain. Even if she did not have any emotional intellect, she should still understand what he meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some things ought to be like this, just like a couple being together and still saying ‘I love you’ every single day. Some people felt that this was something necessary while others felt that it was unnecessary. However, does the other party really know that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman did not reply to him. Qing Shui was not surprised and laughed as he said, “We should see if the box has anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the woman nodded her head and headed over to the box with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During that time, the woman had gained quite a bit. The first stance of the Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique could be considered as cultivated. The only thing was, she had not tested it out yet. However, she knew that using it now would be many times more powerful than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was really happy right now. He had never thought that he would receive such treasures from the Ancient Divine Shrine. He did not know whether the next stage was the last, but regardless, he had gained a lot this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opening this treasure box, they found several items within. What made Qing Shui happy was the medicinal pellets within. There were several bottles of medicinal pellets and two pieces of Beast Parchments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were ten bottles inside and their size was about the size of a fist. They were gray in color and looked stylish, with drawings of spiritual medicinal plants. There were also words on the bottles, namely Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and Fortune Golden Pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each type of pellet had five bottles, each bottle contained one pellet…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out the two Alchemy Recipes, they were the recipes for the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and Fortune Golden Pellet. The Nine Revolution Golden Pellet were meant for human consumption, it could rapidly increase the strength of the consumer. If a normal person consumed one pellet, they would directly level up to Early Martial Saint. If they consumed a second one, the effect would be halved, and if they consumed another one, the effect would be reduced in half again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ignoring the user’s level, a superior medicinal pellet that could be used by anyone of any strength. However, no one would be silly enough to allow a normal person to consume the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet. These medicinal pellets were too precious and the medicinal herbs required are so rare to the point where most are unheard of. Each herb listed in the alchemy recipe required at least 10,000 years to cultivate and some even required 50,000 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui felt that the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet’s powerful effect was inevitable from its ingredients. The first base value of consuming the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet was that a normal person would reach Martial Saint, and the next stage would be a Martial Saint reaching Peak Martial Saint…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Peak Martial Saint would immediately break through to Early Martial Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a False God martial artist was to consume it for the first time, they would improve by one grade. For Qing Shui and the Demon Lord, one grade of increase in strength was equivalent to doubling in strength. However, this was only a one time opportunity. The second time they consumed the pellet, the effect would be halved. If they consumed it again, the effect would be quartered, and then an eighth…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then looked towards the Fortune Golden Pellet. The effect was the same as the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet, but the effect worked only on beasts. However, Qing Shui was surprised. The ingredients needed were also extremely precious, but Qing Shui’s Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal already had a portion of it. The difference was the age requirement of the medicinal herbs, but with the presence of the Eighth Grade Spiritual Medicinal Beast Dragon Slaying Beast, it would require only a short while before the herbs could achieve the correct age. The only issue was that majority of the medicinal herbs could not be found. It seemed that he would not be able to refine the pellets anytime soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui handed the medicine to the woman, “For you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t want it, I’m not an Alchemist,” the Demon Lord said bluntly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look at the effect of the medicinal pellet first. Then check how many medicinal pellets you need and take that amount,” Qing Shui said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t need it. I already got too much, you should use these!” The Demon Lord shook her head as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really not want to take a look? This is definitely a good stuff, an amazing stuff.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Lord did not say anything. This was her strongest specialty, silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out two Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and two Fortune Golden Pellet and gave them to the Demon Lord, “You should use the Nine Revolution Golden Pellet and give the Fortune Golden Pellet to Old Turtle. The other two should be given to Sister Hua. You should use it here, I will stand guard for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that if they use these two pellets, facing off against the people from the Justice Alliance would be easier. Moreover, they do not know the dangers of the next palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Lord hesitated for a bit and then nodded. Qing Shui took out two Fortune Golden Pellets and fed one each to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the Hellfire Phoenix. He had originally thought that he would save it for other people, but if the strength was too weak then the pellet would be wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One pellet was naturally saved for the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortune Golden Pellet, the name of ‘Fortune’</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;was not used randomly. The pellet bestowed both power and fortune to the beast that consumed it, allowing the beast’s strength to powered up in a balanced manner in the most optimal way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was silent. The advancement was over without much reaction. As he watched the Demon Lord stood up, her charm and grace made Qing Shui shiver within his heart. Wearing the Goddess Divine Set, the Demon Lord’s strength would be around 90 million sun and should be nearing the boundary. They had originally thought that under the effect of the Goddess Divine Set, her strength would surpass the 100 million mark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this is already frightening, her increased in strength had also increased her level. Qing Shui felt that the Demon Lord was more ice-cold, unable to be grasped like a mist. He touched his nose as he felt happy regardless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the strength of Qing Shui’s Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Hellfire Phoenix would be now around 60 million sun. This was already frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Hellfire Phoenix’s body size did not increase much. However, the violent aura surrounding their bodies were much stronger than before, especially the one emitted by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant’s strength had doubled, while its physical strength exceeded 600 sun. This would result in Qing Shui to gain 60 sun of strength. After he calculated it out, Qing Shui’s strength had increased by about a tenth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll guard for you, you can use it too!” The Demon Lord said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can I interpret that as you caring for me?” Qing Shui laughed as he took out a Nine Revolution Pellet and swallowed it. He also gave the last Fortune Golden Pellet to the Dragon Slaying Beast and felt as though he was being too greedy…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pure energy rushed through his body and felt miraculous. It was a type of energy that quickly diffused into every part of the body, giving off a feeling of growth and strengthening in the body’s cells. His strength doubled in a balance manner. His physical strength had reached 1300 sun, his strongest attack can reach approximately 52 million sun. Even a purely physical attack could reach 6 million sun, and the Nine Continents Mountain’s prowess had reached 20 million sun!</span></p>

There was no change in its size, but it felt tougher than before and its speed had also doubled. The huge violent and fierce aura it emitted could stike fear into the heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they met the two Stone Beasts from before, Qing Shui felt that the Dragon Slaying Beast would turn them into a pile of rocks.</span></p>

Qing Shui retrieved them and said, “Here, for you. We now have four pellets each.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Woman!”</span></p>

He carelessly called her ‘woman’ earlier without thinking much about it. He had not thought that she would remember this, it would seem her tolerance was not very big. Could this be considered as an improvement to their relationship?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His massive increased in strength made Qing Shui felt happy. He followed the woman into the sixth palace, utilizing his spiritual sense and getting ready for battle. However, contrary to his expectation, there was nothing dangerous that they could sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This area was huge. There were around a hundred large stone pillars holding it up, but there was no stone door that lead to the next palace. This was probably the last palace of the shrine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the middle of the hall was a giant stone coffin. In the four corners of the stone coffin stood four stone giants, but none of them seemed to be moving. Even after Qing Shui and the woman entered, the four stone giants had no reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This should be the resting place of the Battle God,” Qing Shui said after he looked around.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the stone coffin. Its length and width were about ten meters long while its height was about three meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These four stone giants are stronger than the Stone Beasts from before. Everything should be fine if we are careful,” Qing Shui said casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Each palace of this shrine is interlinked in design by the Battle God. If people could enter this palace, then dealing with the stone giants should not be an issue. The key is in the Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique. If the person did not know the Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique, they probably can not enter here.” the Demon Lord readied her weapon after speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like I should find a weapon.”</span></p>

Right now, he thought that even if he did not add any attack buffs to the weapon, it could still be utilized well for some techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, around a hundred people suddenly rushed up to them. This stunned Qing Shui for a second. But after he thought for a bit, he realized that the earlier mechanisms that prevented their entry were all useless now. The first Battle God Statue could not prevent actual martial arts experts from entering. The Battle God Statue was most likely destroyed and what was left was only the Maze Formation, so entering into this place was not surprising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing these many people, it included those from the Justice Alliance and those from the Evil side. Hua Rumei was here as well, thus the Old Turtle was the only one remaining outside to defend those of the Demon Lord Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Lu Brothers from the Divine Beast Sect was here as well. When they saw Qing Shui and the Demon Lord, their expressions were weird. The same weird expression could be seen on those from the Justice Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, who was ready to fight, decided to back away. He smiled as he looked at the crowd and walked next to people from the Divine Sound Sect. The group was near the Divine Beast Sect and Ghost Valley members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were roughly 20 people from the Four Great Evil Powers, but the Justice Alliance had roughly 80 people. The smell of gunpowder was thickening even though the air was still.</span></p>

It was because Qing Shui knew the guy, it was the Joyous Sage he had met before.</span></p>

His clothing style was different from before, but Qing Shui could recognize the elder from one glance. Of course, the elder could recognize Qing Shui as well.</span></p>

I had never thought of seeing you here. You are a member of the Demon Lord Palace?” The elder looked at the woman next to Qing Shui and exclaimed in disbelief.</span></p>

He seemed to have grasped something, but at the same time, he couldn’t grasp it.</span></p>
