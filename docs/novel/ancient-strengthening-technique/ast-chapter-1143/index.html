 <p><strong>AST 1143 - Longevity Fish, Infatuated Fish, Infatuated People, Divine Weapon Street</strong></p>
 <p>It might not have been that long, Qing Shui’s Tidal Cloud Waves Seal had already gone through tremendous changes. Now, it could already be considered to have reached an advanced stage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only came to a stop after he could no longer perceive the mysterious sensation. He was aware that without the earlier sensation, his cultivation would slow down immediately. This was one of the important factors of cultivating, the sensation of comprehension!</p>
 <p>It had always been emphasized that cultivation was 99% hard work and effort, while the other 1% was from comprehension. That 1% from comprehension was something that a martial artist could not cultivate without. It was said to be more important than the 99% of hard work and effort spent on cultivating. Just like what happened today, one morning of comprehension was equivalent to at least ten years of hard work spent cultivating.</p>
 <p>The surroundings became really quiet. While reflected on the scene from back then, Qing Shui took out his Pure Gold Fishing Rod to once again relieve his boredom. By doing so, he would be able to calm his mind even further.</p>
 <p>Fishing could help practice one’s patience and temperament. The reason being that such activity required a calm mind. At the moment when the fishing float once again moved up and down on the surface of the sea, he immediately pulled it up.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui was stunned.</p>
 <p>It was a silvery green colored fish. This fish looked really weird. Physically, its look resembled that of a carp fish. However, its head was bigger. The most unique feature about this fish was that it had a mustache which looked just like that of a flood dragon. With all this, it looked particularly weird. Nevertheless, Qing Shui felt incomparably happy.</p>
 <p>Longevity Fish!</p>
 <p>Longevity Fish was a unique aquatic species. It was not in the slightest inferior to the Golden Medicinal Turtle in Qing Shui’s Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. However, the Longevity Fish was a single-use consumable type ingredient. Its body contained a mysterious energy that could help with recovery and curing diseases. The most important use of it was that by consuming one Longevity Fish, one would be able to increase their lifespan by ten years. Each individual could only consume a maximum of ten Longevity Fish within their lifetime.</p>
 <p>The Longevity Fish wasn’t large in size. It was less than a foot long, yet they were still capable of surviving within the ocean safely without being threatened by other species. This species itself also had a particularly long life. It’s said that they could live up to a thousand years and that the longer they lived, the more precious they would become. They could also be used to make medicine.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui joyfully threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He thought to himself that today was quite a rewarding day. It would have been much better if he could catch a few more of them. If this happened, he would be able to make them reproduce within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to fantasize while fishing at the same time. He was really confident with himself to the point that he didn’t really care if he got something good or not. It was just like when a person was no longer hungry, they would start to get a bit slower in consuming their food. Nor would they feel really eager to eat their meal even if their meal had been really delicious.</p>
 <p>It was not that Qing Shui didn’t want good stuff, he was just aware that it was not that easy to capture good things. He was already considered to be really lucky to be able to capture one of them.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qing Shui lifted up his head and saw both Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan approaching him in a rush.</p>
 <p>“Now then, you don’t have to worry anymore, do you? I knew it, you wouldn’t want to leave without seeing Sister Ruyan for the last time. Do you really have that little faith in me?” Tantai Xuan asked calmly.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s because I felt that this place was quite a nice place. That’s why I decided to do some fishing here. I am so happy that I just managed to capture a Longevity Fish just now! The Southern Sea indeed has a lot of good stuff!”</p>
 <p>“Continue bluffing!” Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui without any traces of a smile.</p>
 <p>“Look, another one just took the bait! There you go, another Longevity Fish.” Qing Shui smiled and pulled up the rod.</p>
 <p>This time, everyone got startled!</p>
 <p>It was another Longevity Fish!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the struggling Longevity Fish before moving on to look at the two surprised ladies. After a while Tantai Xuan responded, “Previously, did you really capture a Longevity Fish?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah!” Qing Shui answered seriously.</p>
 <p>“Well, then it isn’t weird. This time, this fish took the bait on purpose. Longevity Fish often appear in pairs. If you’re really able to capture one, the other one would let itself be captured on purpose. If only one of them got captured, it wouldn’t be able to live for more than three days. The Longevity Fish is also known as the Infatuated Fish,” Tantai Xuan explained slowly. Her voice sounded really pleasant to hear. Except it made people a bit lost in terms of what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui too didn’t know that things would turn out this way. Previously, he was still upset for only getting one Longevity Fish. Everything was fine now, for all he knew, he might really be able to raise a whole school of Longevity Fish.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was a bit stunned, the reason being that she knew quite a lot about the Longevity Fish. Apparently, only those who’re infatuated in love would be able to capture Longevity Fish. Longevity Fish possessed really strong spirituality. It had already been made pretty obvious with the fact that they were able to survive in the dangerous ocean without any battle capabilities.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan found it really hard to consider this man an infatuated person. He had quite a few wives. If someone was really infatuated with love, how would they have more than one wife.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui threw the other Longevity Fish into the pond in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This time, he finally managed to find peace in his mind. He looked at the two girls, “You guys can head back now, I’m about to leave.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stepped forward and embraced Yu Ruyan before he began madly nibbled on her. Tantai Xuan, who was standing at the side, wanted to give him a beating. This man was so unbridled.</p>
 <p>Her heart had never been so confused. No man had ever done this in front of her…...</p>
 <p>Actually, most of the time, men would often be pretentious when they were in front of women. Or maybe, it was safer to say that they would try harder to make themselves look better, particularly when they were in front of the girls they liked. If they didn’t like a girl, they would act more naturally.</p>
 <p>Little did they know that the more they tried to pretend, the more unpleasant they would make people around them feel. A lot of people also knew that this had to do with something called k“Rejecting what was near to them and seeking those that were far away.” Despite this, it’s hard for them to control themselves. It’s only when one stopped having any extra thoughts towards a woman that they would begin to act more naturally or maybe, even go as far as to ignore the woman.</p>
 <p>This was exactly how Tantai Xuan as feeling now. This man had already repeatedly ignored her a number of times. Even though she hadn’t really had much interaction with men, she still knew about them generally. Also, she could tell a thing or two about it from his expressions.</p>
 <p>When Yu Ruyan got nibbled by Qing Shui, she blushed and pushed Qing Shui away. She glared at Qing Shui with a bitter face and after that moved on to look at the unnatural Tantai Xuan. She felt so ashamed that she was almost unable to show her face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left!</p>
 <p>Both Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan were still standing there. Yu Ruyan looked at Tantai Xuan with an embarrassed look. Nevertheless, Tantai Xuan held Yu Ruyan’s hand and smiled, “You will definitely be happy with him.”</p>
 <p>“Hm, Sister Xuan, why are you siding with him this time?” Yu Ruyan was really shocked. Even though Qing Shui didn’t directly offend Tantai Xuan this should have definitely upset her.</p>
 <p>“Longevity Fish is also known as the Infatuated Fish. Only people infatuated with love are able to capture it. Only those who have unyielding love are able to capture it. When someone like this dedicates their feelings to a person, they will never change them. This will never change.” Tantai Xuan smiled as she explained.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xuan, tell me, how many girls can this infatuated person dedicate his infatuated love to?” Yu Ruyan looked at Tantai Xuan confused.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. You should have experienced this before. Alright, let’s stop talking about this, in any case, you two are already in such a relationship. Sister Ruyan, you will definitely be happy in the future. Even my master has a really good impression of him.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui headed back with his Nine Continents Steps. Actually, he felt really happy, if he wanted to meet Yu Ruyan, he could just go back and forth between the two places in a day. Before his Nine Continent Steps got upgraded, it would require him a number of days to go there. But now, he could go back and forth almost instantaneously by utilizing Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>By the time he arrived at the courtyard, it was only the middle of the afternoon. This was good because this meant that he was alone in Yan City. He wouldn’t go as far as calling himself lonely, what kind of loneliness had he not experienced before?</p>
 <p>Now, the only thing he wanted to do was to increase his strength and become a State Master as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>The thing he wanted to do now was to be the State Master of Great Yu Dynasty, the peak Grade Two Dynasty State Master as soon as possible. Then, he wanted use the strength of Dynasty to look for Di Chen. If not, he felt that any hope of him finding Di Chen would be very slim.</p>
 <p>He walked out of the house. In front of the house was already a luxurious street. On both sides of the continents, there were a lot of luxurious streets. Within them, all sorts of people would move back and forth along the streets doing their own important things.</p>
 <p>Previously, he rejected Formation Immortal Sect’s kindness. The reason being that even though it was a huge sect, he felt that it had already begun to crumble. Most importantly, Qiu Feng was the weakest among the Formation Immortal Sect. He was reluctant to get himself involved in the battle between sects.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about things to do while walking along the street. After all, he already had more than enough time to cultivate in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Hence, he made up his mind to do something in Yan City. It would be best if he could attract people’s attention with his strength and befriend them. Most importantly, the things that he did must be able to benefit himself. For example, with a wider network, he would be able to find Di Chen. Or maybe, it could also help him in improving his strength.</p>
 <p>At the moment, he already had quite a few things that he could present to the world. Qing Shui continued to walk while thinking and eventually found himself along a luxurious street.</p>
 <p>Divine Weapon Street!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the name of the street, he felt really weird. Only after walking in did he find out that there were a lot of blacksmith shops along the street. Nevertheless, it was not that each and every one of the buildings were all blacksmith shops. Among them, there were still others such as restaurants. Basically, in every one hundred meters, there would be a huge hall for forging metals. They gave off really powerful auras, with just one glance, one could already tell that those were high grade weapons and armor. Compared to the Firecloud Blacksmith Store, these stores were a lot bigger.</p>
 <p>For Sale!</p>
 <p>Not long after Qing Shui entered the street, he saw a sign with the words For Sale on it. He entered the store and saw that it was a smaller Blacksmith Store. Nevertheless, it was still a lot bigger than the Firecloud Blacksmith Store in Hundred Miles City. It was just that it was one of the smallest here.</p>
 <p>Divine Weapon Street was really wide. People walking along the street were basically warriors. Qing Shui could even sense powerful warriors here with his Spiritual Sense.</p>
 <p>There were people here who forged weapons and armor as well as accessories. Of course, some forged all of those. The street was a well known street in Yan City. Qing Shui intentionally made note of the Divine Weapon Street on the map of the Great Yu Dynasty.</p>
 <p>It was said that many years ago, this street had once forged a lot of divine weapons and armor. It was also since that time that this street started to be known as the Divine Weapon Street. This was a kind of glory. However, as time passed, production of divine quality items started to decline, leaving behind only the name of the street.</p>
 <p>After all, divine weapons were still legendary weapons. Even during that time, not many of them actually appeared. Forging divine weapons seemed to also require a lot of luck. Nowadays, it was very rare to hear people forging divine weapons or armor. Nevertheless, the weapons and armor forged here were still quite outstanding. A lot of people would forge their weapons here.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, it hit him that he could open up a smith shop here. Whenever he was free, he could practice his forging skills or do something else like carving seals. Besides that, he could also get a better understanding of the incidents revolving around the Great Yu Dynasty. For he knew, one day, he might hear news of Di Chen.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thought about this, he walked towards the store which was for sale. It was in a decent location. It was just a bit small. The front part of the store was a forging hall. From Qing Shui’s perspective, it was already considered quite large. It was just that when compared to those he had seen before, it looked a bit run down.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a step into the blacksmith shop. There were very few people here. The weapons in here also weren’t really that eye-catching. An old man could be seen beating something inside and the heavy hammering noises could be constantly heard.</p>
