 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha. Is this how it is for a great clan? Why do I feel that it's worse off than an ordinary clan? What's the difference between this and selling off your own daughters? I feel ashamed for you as well. This clan head is really hopeless. To think a person like you can become a clan head. I wonder if you have any daughters? Why don't you marry your daughter over?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui said, feeling displeased when he saw Yu Xixuan's completely disheartened expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's words had caused Yu Dingshan's countenance to change completely and his amicable expression suddenly emitted sharp killing intent, locking onto Qing Shui, "You're courting death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not a single great clan would be able to tolerate what Qing Shui had said earlier. After all, it was a blatant humiliation. At this moment, an old man had already taken action, slapping out a palm imprint toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attack might seem casual, but Qing Shui could sense the terrifying prowess behind it. It was even more powerful than Yu Dinghe's abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the attack had sent Qing Shui flying backward, he wasn't hurt. He looked at this elderly man, "I don't wish to make any enemies, but I hope that you guys don't go overboard. He isn't a match for me. You may believe that I don't have anyone backing me up, but if I were to take action against your Yu Clan, you won't be able to fend me off."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's words were completely out of Yu Dingshan’s expectation and surprised him. He then noticed Qing Shui suddenly moving toward the old man, "I'll let you see how many moves this old man can handle."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Diamond Seal, Buddha Wisdom Seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Bright Seal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smashed toward the old man's Shanzhong Acupoint at his chest with a Hitting A Cow Through A Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pfft!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man spurted a mouthful of blood and was forced to retreat. However, Qing Shui continued to press on forward, performing continuous combos with his acupoint clearing moves. During the middle of his assault, he even used Gouging Strike and the Dragon-capturing Hands. The old man hadn't been able to attack from the moment that Qing Shui made his moves. His Qi activities were being suppressed completely and he wasn't able to circulate his Qis. It was like how in his previous life, there were instances where there would be people who fell the moment they tried to summon up their power, and could not draw up any strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The requirement to suppress the opponent using this method was very high. Moreover, if the other party's strength was a lot higher your own, then it would be even more difficult to suppress. It was like no matter how skillful an ant was, it won't be able to move an elephant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui returned to Yu Xixuan's side, the old man had already fainted. His internal organs and meridian channels had been inflicted with injuries of varying degrees. He had already been crippled. Previously, each of the old man's moves had been a killing move, and Qing Shui had already shown leniency to not have killed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Yu Dingshan's heart went on a rollercoaster ride. For someone this young to have such power, Yu Clan's geniuses were nothing when compared to him. Moreover, he could tell that Yu Xixuan was twice as strong as she had been before, and was now a lot stronger than his own talented son. Could it also be because of this young man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui were to say that there weren't any influences backing him up now, there's no way that Yu Dingshan would believe him. He probably won't be the only one. No one else would believe him either. Influences that were a lot stronger than their Yu Clan won't be able to nurture such a young expert, let alone their Yu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Clan head Yu, because of Xixuan, I don't wish to make enemies out of the Yu Clan. This place is just a stopover for me and I may leave very soon. I don't really care for the things here. I wonder what do you plan on doing?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's words were brimming with confidence. He didn't care for the Azure Rainbow City, nor was he interested to get involved. Through one message, he had revealed that he placed himself above the Azure Rainbow City and the sole reason he was here was because of Yu Xixuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a clan's head, especially of a clan like the Yu Clan, to still marry Yu Xixuan to Third Young Master Liu under such a situation, it meant that Yu Dingshan was an unyielding person. This was also why Qing Shui would dare to do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How do you wish to handle this?" Yu Dingshan tossed the question back to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Regardless of your relationship to Xixuan, I had said earlier that I'm a physician. I can help you to treat someone. As long as the person isn't dead, I'll be able to bring him back to how he originally had been. I'll be staying in the Azure Rainbow City for a while. There's no hurry to decide who to seek treatment for. What do you think?" Qing Shui proposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know that you doubt my medical skills. Therefore, I have an idea that you can try it out now. You can either look for someone injured or just injure someone right now. It doesn’t matter how serious the injuries are, as long as the person still has a breath left in him." Qing Shui reckoned that Yu Dingshan was still doubtful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dingshan smiled, "You seemed very sincere. Then you can treat Elder Qiao!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui naturally didn't have a problem with this. "His injuries are too light. Do you want to add on some more?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dingshan's face twitched and he quickly said, "There is no need for that. I know that Elder Qiao is basically crippled and have no ways of recovering."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone could tell that Elder Qiao had been completely disabled. Even if he won't die, he basically was a dead man walking. Therefore, if Qing Shui could treat him, then he'd definitely be an existence that can astonish the whole Azure Rainbow City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was how it was. Many capable physicians were just short of an opportunity and did have the chance to treat an expert. Even if they were to treat ordinary people, they wouldn't get any attention. After all, the patients were just ordinary people and no one would believe them. They would merely think that these people were just starting rumors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Qiao had already woken up and he didn't seem to hold any grudges against Qing Shui. He had already gotten on in age and could see through things well. It wasn't that he hadn't thought that something like this wouldn't happen, but he just hadn't expected that he would be beaten into such a state by a young man. Moreover, he hadn't been able to retaliate at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dingshan's astonishment was indescribable. It was because Qing Shui's attacks had completely overthrown his recognition. This must be the signature moves of some influences in the depths of the Nine Continents World. After all, Qing Shui was able to defeat Elder Qiao to the extent that that latter was unable to retaliate, despite that there was a gap of three folds in their abilities. What kind of power was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After witnessing Qing Shui beat up Elder Qiao, Yu Dingshan no longer dared to harm Qing Shui. Even if Qing Shui were to stand there and did not move at all, Yu Dingshan wouldn't dare to touch him. This was akin to how in Qing Shui's previous life, a magistrate wouldn't dare to do anything to a mayor's child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took his gold needles and used his Five Elements Qi, Force of Rebirth, his proficiency in wood attributes skills, as well as his other skills. Qing Shui's current medical skills could only be described using the term 'divine'. After about an hour, Qing Shui withdrew the needles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Elder Qiao wouldn't be able to recover to his original state immediately, everyone could tell that he didn't even look to be seriously injured at the moment. He would be able to recover after resting for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, it wouldn't take very long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This had once again astonished everyone, including Yu Dingshan. He seemed as if he had just seen something amazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Clan head Yu, I've only come out to gain experience for my medical skills this time around. Therefore, I'll be setting up a medical hall in the Azure Rainbow City. You can introduce patients over. I'll leave this chance to you. It's up to you whether you can grab onto it or not. I won't disturb you any further."</span></p>

This was a great opportunity and he knew it well. He said happily, "Thank you, Sir. Please do come in. I'll prepare a feast to welcome you."</span></p>

Although our Yu Clan isn't a great clan, we're still able to provide a place for you to set up a medical hall. I hope that you won't reject us and just take it as our repayment."

This was human nature. Qing Shui could sense that at the very least, the Yu Clan's head was at least not too bad. Therefore, he decided to give the Yu Clan a chance. As for Yu Xixuan, Qing Shui knew that in the future, the entire Yu Clan would rise by a few notches because of her.</span></p>

Yu Jianming's face was now flushed, not knowing how he should face Qing Shui. He was a proud person and was unable to get used to this change all of a sudden.</span></p>
