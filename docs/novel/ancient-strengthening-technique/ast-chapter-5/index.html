 <p><strong>Chapter 5 Qing Shui Cultivates!.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>Ancient Strengthening Technique: Chapter 5 – Qing Shui Cultivates!</strong></p>
  <p><span style>These days were very peaceful, despite the fact that he was still unable to form that single strand of Qi, Qing Shui was still practising the Ancient Strengthening Technique relentlessly. He believed that he would succeed sooner or later.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Yin-Yang symbol within his sea of consciousness was constantly nourishing his body, Qing Shui could feel his constitution slowly improving. The improvements did not refer to his muscles but to his bones and organs getting tougher!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui still looked small and weak. However, amidst his skinny and delicate body frame one could now sense a hint of vitality that was not there before! The sense of charm inside his eyes had also grown to the point where it held a hint of profoundness. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that he should disclose his current body condition, letting them know that he had rebuilt his constitution and could begin to practise martial arts. Initially, Qing Shui planned to keep this a secret, but he longed for the day where the hope in Qing Yi’s eyes would be realised. Therefore, Qing Shui decided to tell Qing Yi the truth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As he returned from the mountains, inside the courtyard of the Qing Mansion, the clan members from the 3rd generation were all zealously practising the Qing Clan secret technique – Blue Lotus Art</span></p>
  <p><span style>Due to Qing Shui being unable to cultivate for several years there was now a considerable distance between him and the other clan members, so they no longer cared when they saw this “trash” walk by.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the innermost section of the Qing Mansion.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Yi was standing at the house entrance. This was the place where both mother and son had stayed all of their life. There was a small garden here, completely filled with plants and flowers as well as &nbsp;a medium sized lake with azure coloured carps swimming around leisurely.It gave people a rustic feeling as they gazed at this place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Yi was standing by the lake side, her beautiful face alongside her gentle and graceful demeanour gave off a sense of beauty that could only be described as sinking fishes falling birds [1]. At this moment it was as if Qing Yi was a perfect portrait of beauty! However, there were moments where one could sense sadness emanating out as she stood there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui already saw his mother from a distance away, this is the umpteenth times he saw Qing Yi standing in the exact same position. “Sigh… but what can I do now?” To attain her wish, I must first become stronger… Much stronger than I am currently.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At the age of 1, Qing Shui could already understand the things people said around him. Qing Yi naturally didn’t know this and would often sigh and talk to him about her secrets as a form of release when Qing Shui was still an infant.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui covertly sneaked out before he shouting in a loud voice “Mother, I am back, I have recovered, I am fine now!!” He did not want Qing Yi to know that he had witnessed her despair earlier. He felt that this despair of hers was too personal for him to encroach upon, therefore Qing Shui decided to loudly announce his arrival so that Qing Yi could notice him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was just as he thought, once Qing Yi heard his voice her expressions instantly changed, greeting him with a smile on her face with no signs of her earlier melancholy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt a stab of pain in his heart. “Mother suffered so much, but in order not to let me worry, she always pretended to be happy in front of me. Only in the middle of the night, when there was no one around, would she finally cry out.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mother, I have completely recovered! I can now cultivate!” Qing Shui happily smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could see traces of happiness and the once extinguished hope rekindle in Qing Yi eyes!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Did you do anything forbidden? Do not make me worry Qing Shui, I just want you to be happy..” Qing Yi slightly berated Qing Shui, because from her expert opinion it was almost impossible for Qing Shui to recover. There was almost no way for him to start cultivating because of his weak heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that it wouldn’t be that easy for Qing Yi to believe in it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mother, it is true. These few days, Grandpa has brewed a lot of purple ginseng soup for me to consume. Grandpa said that these 100 year old ginsengs were invaluable!” Qing Shui spoke excitedly in the manner of a child.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After hearing this, Qing Yi felt that there was a slight chance that Qing Shui’s constitution could actually have improved! She then asked “Qing Shui, tell me the details of everything that happened, I want to be clear before making any diagnosis”.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Two days ago, after drinking the 100 year ginseng brew, I felt full of energy. It was as though the problem of my breathlessness had also disappeared! Mother had forbidden me from sprinting as my heart may not be able to take the stress. However, at that point I could feel a sense of boundless energy within me. Thus I ran faster and faster, up the mountain and back down to the Qing Mansion, but nothing bad happened to me!” Qing Shui hurriedly explained.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is this true…? Shui`er, is what you said true?!” Qing Yi eyes were brimming with tears.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“ It is the truth. Even Grandpa knows about it, he took my pulse and said that I was fine. To be even more certain he wants to bring me to Doctor Wu, so I came to invite mother to go with me!” Qing Shui excitedly pulled Qing Yi’s sleeves slightly as he talked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Alright! Let us go together!” Qing Yi happily held Qing Shui’s hand. The excitement in her heart was forcibly suppressed, but Qing Shui could still somewhat feel it. Now she is just temporarily overjoyed, but in the future, I will make sure that she stays happy forever!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Clan’s Master, congratuations! Young Master Qing Shui has no problems with his body at all. In fact, his internal organs are even stronger than ordinary people. This rate of recovery is really too astounding!” Doctor Wu enthusiastically added.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, just these few sentences from Doctor Wu confirming Qing Shui’s recovery caused tears to flow down Qing Yi’s face. She was tightly embracing Qing Shui. Qing Shui smiled as he knew that these were tears were not born out of anguish, but came from happiness!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mother dearest.. don’t cry.” Qing Shui gently wiped the tears off her face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After escorting Doctor Wu out, Qing Luo returned with a peculiar expression on his face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Initially, Qing Shui had a very weak constitution, unsuitable for practising martial arts. Qing Luo was also sad for him. After all, Qing Shui was the son of his beloved daughter. However, if Qing Shui ever managed to recover, he would surely be stronger than average when compared to people of the same martial realm. If he grew up, he would definitely become an exceptional genius, and given how much he loved his mother, he would absolutely seek revenge in the future! Sigh, this must be karma..</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Grandpa, Mother, I wish to cultivate!” These few words from Qing Shui greatly startled both Qing Luo and Qing Yi.</span></p>
