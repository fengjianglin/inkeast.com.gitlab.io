 <p><strong>Chapter 209 Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>AST 209 Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine</strong></p>
  <p>A woman’s beauty relied on class. Class was like alcohol: the longer you ferment it, the more flavorful it is. Flower vase women were like blooming flowers. They were beautiful yet ephemeral!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui found this amusing, but when he heard Canghai Mingyue’s words, he still felt slightly touched. It was especially that line, “Your treasure is only a treasure to you”. To think that Huoyun Liu-Li saw him as her treasure and liked him so much…</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not understand why she had gifted him the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron back in the Hundred Miles City. Could she already have taken a liking to him back then? Or did she only feel something for him after coming to Cang Lang Country?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that a man would only need a moment to take a liking to a woman. He would need only a short moment’s time to feel touched and fall in love with her. More often than not, there would first be lust before love. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, a woman’s best impression towards a man was more for his appearance. Qing Shui was not very approving of love at first sight, but for a woman to fall in love with a man, it would take a very long time or even a lifetime.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not know if Huoyun Liu-Li actually liked him or was it just friendly relationship. </p>
  <p>Between the conversation, Qing Shui regained his senses and noticed that a small cup of dark green liquid was placed before everyone which gave out a pure and deep smell.</p>
  <p>“Senior, what is with this “ half-moment immortal”? It has such a weird name.” Qing Shui took in a deep breath and asked.</p>
  <p>“It’s the name of the wine. When you drink this cup of “half-moment immortal”, you will be able to enjoy the feeling of being deity for half a moment’s duration.” The man laughed and said.</p>
  <p>“Stop bluffing, it’s not like I haven’t drank it before. While it is tasty, it is rubbish to say that it gives one the feeling of a deity. Who would know what a deity would feel like?” The woman said relentlessly, probably because the man was talking big again.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue could not help but laugh when she heard the conversation between her parents. Qing Shui felt that it was very heartwarming. When he was with his mother, he had the same feeling. While his family was poor in his previous life, he had experienced a similar feeling as well.</p>
  <p>Only a few of them picked up their wine cups. The cup was very small and was only sufficient for a small sip, making it seem as if the wine was truly precious. For a Martial King Expert to be so “stingy” with it, it was definitely not any ordinary wine.</p>
  <p>When the wine was in his mouth, Qing Shui felt that it had a very fine taste which could even cause an increase in the secretion of his saliva. After it went down to his stomach, his whole spine had an especially comfortable feeling, causing his brain to be slightly stimulated as well.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that the moment was very refreshing. It was a really good wine, but overall, Qing Shui felt that it was not as good as his Tiger Bone Liquor. After some hesitation, Qing Shui brought out a bottle of that unbelievable wine.</p>
  <p>This was also a new effect Qing Shui had discovered after the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had broken through to the 4th level. He no longer needed to enter the realm to be able to take or store items.</p>
  <p>After Qing Shui left the whole vat of Tiger Bone Liquor with Huoyun Liu-Li the other time, Qing Shui brewed another big vat of it and left it in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Even though he would have to bear with the swell below, he still wanted to drink it.</p>
  <p>“Senior, it seems like you are also one who likes to drink. I know a little about wine brewing. Have a taste. I think that you’ll like it.” Qing Shui took out a bottle of wine under everyone’s surprised gaze and handed it to Canghai.</p>
  <p>“Oh, good, good. Seems like you’re a kindred soul.”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li, on the other hand, turned red as she looked at Qing Shui. She knew that it was the Tiger Bone Liquor and could not help but blush when she recalled that striking moment she had with Qing Shui when they were drinking that wine.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was slightly puzzled by her reaction. Was there something weird going on? Or could it be that this fellow was thinking of harming her father? That’s not right, Huoyun Liu-Li’s expression was a bit strange. She was probably thinking too much about it…</p>
  <p>“Senior, have a taste. See how it compares to your half-moment immortal.” Qing Shui smiled and said when he saw that the man had wanted to put it away.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui would not feel that the man could not bear to part with the wine. Instead, he probably felt that the wine he brewed was not presentable and he did not want to put Qing Shui in an awkward spot if his daughter were to say something that would embarrass him.</p>
  <p>The woman smiled, took the wine from the man, and opened it. The wine immediately revealed an even more fragrant smell than the one from earlier. It was only then that the man had reacted. The woman was surprised as well.</p>
  <p>“Isn’t this the legendary Tigerbone Yang Amplification, Beauty Purification Wine?” The man said in shock before breaking into an awkward smile.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned as well when he heard the long name, but felt that it was a very suitable one. When the name of the wine was brought up, everyone carried a different expression.</p>
  <p>Amongst the five, the two men appeared awkward while the three peerless beauties were shy and embarrassed!</p>
  <p>“Come, come, everyone have some. This is something which is hard to come by and just a cup of it is very valuable!” Upon saying this, the man filled a full cup for everyone.</p>
  <p>“Godfather, is this really that precious?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s face turned pink as she asked.</p>
  <p>“That’s right. There are records of this item in books and it would appear in the world every now and then. Your godmother and I had the opportunity to have tasted a cup of this before. The taste is not just exemplary, but it also has the effects of strengthening one’s body, beautifying one’s looks, gradually increasing one’s powers, and also strengthening one’s Dantian.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui wanted to say that there was another more important effect, which was to strengthen the thing each man had in their lower bottom. After all, it was not possible to make that thing invincible even through cultivation, with the exception of the Duo Cultivation technique or the consumption of some treasures with supreme Yang. However, most people would not be able to withstand this. While the impact to their lower half was very strong, there was a limit to it.</p>
  <p>“Ahhh, to think that it’s so good. I’ve just finished a whole vat of it in the past half year…”</p>
  <p>This time around, everyone stared at Huoyun Liu-Li in a daze, with the exception of Qing Shui. Huoyun Liu-Li felt very embarrassed under their gazes and her translucent skin was covered in a layer of red.</p>
  <p>The man was still wondering how Qing Shui had managed to get a bottle of it, but did not expected that his new goddaughter had drank a whole vat of it within half year’s time…</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, no wonder I felt that you have become so much more prettier than before! So it’s thanks to this Tigerbone Yang Amplification, Beauty Purification Wine!”</p>
  <p>Agitated, Canghai Mingyue almost said the words boost yang. Even so, she was still extremely embarrassed. When Qing Shui saw that striking beauty, he thought of how people would say that the more arrogant and graceful a woman was, the more intoxicating and attractive they would be when they were shy. Many people liked women who were shy since a shy woman was very beautiful.</p>
  <p>“That’s not true…” Huoyun Liu-Li said, embarrassed.</p>
  <p>“If Senior likes it, I can get you more of it. Or why don’t I give you the prescription? You can brew some yourself if you feel like drinking it.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“That’s not good enough. This is good stuff and too valuable, it won’t do.” The man said firmly.</p>
  <p>“If that’s the case, how about this. Let’s have an exchange if you have any more of those gemstones you gave Liu-Li earlier. How about it?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“That won’t do, your item is too precious. You’ll be losing out too much.” The man smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“If that’s the case, why don’t you give me what’s most precious to you guys?” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“Are you asking for a beating?” Canghai Mingyue said angrily.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and the Canghai couple laughed. Qing Shui looked with interest at the lady who seemed to have changed from the majestic person who had stood on top of the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. The angry look she had on was beautiful, very beautiful…</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that the reason this lady appeared like that was because her parents were present. If not, Qing Shui knew that she would definitely be the same person she was without any desires. Something might change after today.</p>

 <p>“That’s not good enough. This is good stuff and too valuable, it won’t do.” The man said firmly.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, how about this. Let’s have an exchange if you have any more of those gemstones you gave Liu-Li earlier. How about it?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“That won’t do, your item is too precious. You’ll be losing out too much.” The man smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, why don’t you give me what’s most precious to you guys?” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
 <p>“Are you asking for a beating?” Canghai Mingyue said angrily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the Canghai couple laughed. Qing Shui looked with interest at the lady who seemed to have changed from the majestic person who had stood on top of the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. The angry look she had on was beautiful, very beautiful…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the reason this lady appeared like that was because her parents were present. If not, Qing Shui knew that she would definitely be the same person she was without any desires. Something might change after today.</p>
