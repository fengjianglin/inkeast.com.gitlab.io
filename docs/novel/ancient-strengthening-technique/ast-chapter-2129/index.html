 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're from the Firecloud Domain. You must think through this carefully. Even the strongest forces in the Northern Emperor Domain and the Northern King Domain would have to show us some respect." The man lifted his head and said proudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, the Firecloud Domain is the closest to the Northern Emperor Domain with the exception of the Northern King Domain. Both the Northern Emperor Domain and the Northern King Domain are right next to each other, one in the east, and one in the west. The Redcloud Mountains is located between them while the Firecloud Domain is to the northeast of the Northern Emperor Domain. Rumor has it that the Firecloud Domain is a little bit stronger than the Northern Emperor Domain and the Northern King Domain. However, no one is exactly sure, they should be about the same. The Firecloud Domain doesn't have many conflicts with the Northern Emperor Domain or the Northern King Domain." said Nuo Lan softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I understand. So they are people from other domain." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan didn't know what to say. When one encountered such events, sometimes, they mustn't retreat. After all, the people here were all from the Northern Emperor Domain or the Northern King Domain. If the people from the Firecloud Domain were to gain the upper hand, it would reflect that they are too useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's calm words had its effect. Ultimately, this place was the intersection between the Northern Emperor Domain and the Northern King Domain. If the people from the Firecloud Domain could have their way here, it would be too humiliating for them. Even if the Advancing Divine Worm were to be sold to the people from the Firecloud Domain instead of someone from the Northern Emperor Domain, this man would be shamed and it might be hard for him to progress in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Qing Shui's words, the countenance of that middle-aged man from the Firecloud Palace changed. He knew that the tables were turned and wanted to say something when the middle-aged man tossed the Hundred Treasure Chest to Qing Shui directly. "Here, take it. I trust you guys. You can decide what price to pay me!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man knew that this thing was like a hot potato. If he knew that this would happen, he wouldn't have caught the Advancing Divine Worm. The people in the surroundings didn't catch it and didn't get themselves in trouble, but yet they could still make a fuss about it to get some benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't expected things to turn out this way. Nodding, he tossed the Hundred Treasure Chest into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and heaved a sigh of relief. He took out quite a lot of things and tossed them to the people around who had wanted to get some benefits. He also told them that he was a physician of the Imperial Cuisine Hall in the Northern Emperor Domain's Northern Emperor City. Quite a number of people actually knew of it and requested for the benefits to be changed to accumulated points and a chance to seek treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded and gave out some tokens. He was considered to have taken out quite a huge sum and finally satisfied these people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Qing Shui left with that man and Nuo Lan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister, you saw it for yourself. Those people won't let things end like this for me. If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have caught it and bring so much trouble to myself." The middle-aged man couldn't feel happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you interested in the way of healing?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The way of healing? I'm interested in medical skills, but I've never picked it up before." The man looked at Qing Shui, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's good that you have interest. I'm also aware that you're troubled, but I won't let anything happen to you. What other people do you have in your family? Would it be convenient for your family to move to the Imperial Cuisine Hall?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Imperial Cuisine Hall was small, there was still some free space. The third story was Nuo Lan's and the second story Qing Shui's. There was still a small bedroom on the first story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My parents are no longer around. I have a brother but he has set up his own family and moved away. I'm now alone and by myself..." He seemed to find it a little hard to continue on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and said softly, "I can help you to recover. You'll be able to get married and have children of your own. In the future, you'll become a respected miraculous physician."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man's body shook. When he was young, he had hurt his lower body in a fight against a demonic beast. Therefore, he had never gotten married after all this time. Although his cultivation wasn't high, it wasn't bad either, being at Peak Martial Saint. Other people at his level of strength would usually have great riches and many wives. However, this man couldn't even compare with the most ordinary men. He would rather be an ordinary healthy man...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn't because of his younger brother, he wouldn't have thought of continuing his life like this. There was no happiness in his life. Many ladies liked him and he had no shortage of money. He was also strong and was still young. However, he knew his own condition. Right now, there was still a lady who was waiting for him. She had waited for him for 30 years and still continue to wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Can it really be done?" The middle-aged man's body was trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You'll be fine after a while. Come, let's go find a place to take a rest and then I'll help to treat your condition. Your condition might seem so hard to treat if it's in the hands of someone else, but I'm someone who is able to treat conditions that others cannot." Qing Shui chuckled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan moved around as if she was also looking for the Advancing Divine Worms, but Qing Shui called for her to leave together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They came to a relatively secluded place and Qing Shui helped to treat the man's condition. To treat the injured meridian channels were an easy feat to Qing Shui. When the middle-aged man once again felt something on the lower half of his body, his tears were already flowing out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been so many years. Even if he were to grab it with his own hands, he couldn't feel anything. It was as if a dead part, an external object that didn't grow on his body but was just stuck there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he could now feel it very clearly and streams of heat were being transmitted there. In the end, at the sight of it lifting up, tears flowed out of his eyes. Men shouldn't cry easily, but he felt that even if he were to cry it out today, it would be worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How about it? Do you want to learn from me?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank you, Master!" The man immediately knelt down and kowtowed, paying respect to Qing Shui as his Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he was done with his kowtow, Qing Shui helped him up. Although this man was an honest man, he was still someone with intelligence. The reason Qing Shui took him in as a student was not that he wanted to use this as a method to thank him, but on the account of this person's physique. The man had a physique that was suitable for the art of healing. It would be fine even if he hadn't learned it in the past. It would never be too late for a person with his physique to pick up the art of healing no matter when they started.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn't really describe this man's physique. However, what he could be sure of was that people with such physiques would be more sensitive toward medicinal herbs. This was why Qing Shui had the thought of getting him to learn the art of healing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, one of the reasons was also to repay him for earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan felt a little puzzled when she saw Qing Shui taking in this student. However, she still congratulated the two of them happily. She wasn't sure who she was congratulating, but she knew that this disciple had really gotten a great deal to have Qing Shui as his Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Master, do you still need this Advancing Divine Worm?" asked Zhang Yue.</span></p>

With this thing around, the chances of luring it out would increase by many folds." Zhang Yue said this while bringing out a small wooden Buddha, handing it to Qing Shui.</span></p>

Qing Shui felt a little agitated. If he could get his hands on all of the Advancing Divine Worms here, then he could get a lot stronger. In the Northern Emperor Domain, there were dangers everywhere. The best way to deal with these things was to get stronger.</span></p>

Even though the man dared to bring out the Firecloud Palace's name for his own interest, he wouldn't dare to report back if there were any troubles. Take today's matter for example. If the news of it were brought back, that man's head might just roll.</span></p>

That man was unlikely to report the matter back. Therefore, it was unlikely for them to be troubled by that man in the short term.</span></p>
