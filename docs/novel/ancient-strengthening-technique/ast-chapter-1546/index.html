He turned his head and noticed Qin Qing smiling at him, hence he walked over and asked, “What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing shook her head, “Maybe this cultivation technique is too tyrannical, it isn’t suitable for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded after thinking about it. He had also come to this conclusion. He was able to cultivate this because he had once cultivated Frenzied Bull Strength before. That should have a connection with the mysterious energy that entered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, over ten days passed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Violet Jade Immortal Realm, Qing Shui consumed the last Seven Yang Pill and absorbed the energy within. Right now as his strength increased, Qing Shui felt an indescribable serenity in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a saying that a full bottle made no noise but a half-full bottle clanged a lot. Now, he felt like he was the full bottle compared to him of the past. He suddenly felt many things were inconsequential as his confidence in himself became even stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seven-Colored Pellet increased 50 folds of strength because of the Frenzied Bull Strength. His raw strength stats reached roughly twice that of his previous strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the augmentation effect of the Arhat Bamboo, the Seven-Colored Pellet, the Paragon Golden Armor, the Divine Nebula Formation, and the Seal of Roc, he reached roughly 900 million Sun’s worth of power. Because of the foundation strengthening effect, Qing Shui’s raw strength was extremely dominant. Moreover, his defense wasn’t in anyway inferior to his attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition to Foolish Loyalty and the Paragon Golden Armor, Qing Shui felt his current defense was just like a steel board. If he were to fight with the black dragon again, he was very sure that the black dragon wouldn’t be able to even injure him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A very long time ago, Qing Shui favored sharp attacks and speed. But now, he understood that having a powerful defense and endurance wasn’t bad at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forty Seven Yang Pills allowed him to achieve a heaven-toppling transformation. His powerful defense made it so that attacks from opponents of the same level would only be tantamount to giving him a scratch to ease an itch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Poison Dragon Flower grew healthily in the Violet Jade Immortal Realm. Qing Shui, however, temporarily had no intentions to use the flower; he wanted to wait for it to mature and see if this plant could provide seedlings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He concocted many poisons and they were all extremely deadly. The ingredients and materials from the Poison Dragon were truly useful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui exited the realm, it was already morning. Qin Qing had woken up and was practicing her morning routine some distances away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these few days, she could see Qing Shui’s strength increase with her naked eyes. What made Qing Shui surprised was that during this half a month, Qin Qing had also consumed two Seven-Yang Pills. Although it was also effective on her, she wasn’t under the time-dilation effect of the Violet Jade Immortal Realm, hence her increase in strength wasn’t as fast as that of Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ve grown stronger again.” Qin Qing laughed. This was the fourth time she had said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This shall be the last time. I won’t be able to grow any more in strength within a short period of time.” Qing Shui had the Violet Jade Immortal Realm in addition to his cultivation base being extremely stable before. Hence, now that his strength had increased, it wouldn’t be unstable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you still not satisfied despite getting so strong in the short span of half a month? Anyway, it might not be a good thing if your strength explosively increases too fast and continuously.” Qin Qing smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Should we go back then?” Qin Qing continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she heard Qing Shui’s words earlier, she knew that it was about time for them to return. During this short period of time, she could also be considered to have gained plenty of benefits. Within this half a month of time, both hers and her demonic beast’s strength had increased a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I really feel like staying here like this with you forever.” Qing Shui said with a hint of wishful thinking in his tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing reddened, before speaking in a gentle voice, “Let me go pack my stuff. We will leave soon after.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, he had nothing much to pack. Qin Qing wasn’t slow either. She finished packing soon after and the two of them flew in the direction of the Great Qin Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning to the Great Qin Dynasty, Qing Shui felt a bit uneasy. He thought of the Gu Clan. With his current strength, it should be a piece of cake if he wanted to deal with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Baifo was very happy when he saw Qing Shui and Qin Qing returning. Qing Shui was considered a special existence in the Qin Clan; he was a benefactor to them. Also, many of them believed that Qing Shui would be Qin Qing’s husband in the future. Qin Qing was also considered a unique existence. Many people of the manor knew that she would be a protector of their clan in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Qing Shui, Qin Chuan, Qin Shan, and Qin Ying decided to have a drink to celebrate seeing each other after such a long time. Their interactions were filled with warmth and laughter and the main point was that Qin Chuan and the rest didn’t treat Qing Shui as an outsider. In their hearts, Qing Shui and Qin Qing were bound to be together in the future. There was no problem if she didn’t marry, but if she does get married, the man she marries would surely be Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Love me, love my dog. Because of Qin Qing, Qing Shui felt close to the people of the Qin King Manor. In any case, the people of the manor were characters and personalities similar to Qing Shui’s. If not, he wouldn’t be so close to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Shui, is my sister Qing beautiful?” Qin Ying was the youngest here. Qing Shui would always give her many gifts when he came by. Among the so many males who pursued Qin Qing, Qing Shui was the only one that she approved of. The others were either arrogant, despotic, or hypocrites.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Beautiful. As pretty as a heavenly fairy.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Smelly brat, what nonsense are you talking about.” Qin Qing glared at Qing Shui while she dolled up Qin Ying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Ying made a face, winking as she stared at Qing Shui while secretly making a thumbs up motion with her thumb. Qin Qing saw that and couldn’t help but shake her head helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, Qing`er, I heard some news yesterday. The Leng Clan of the Sacred Might Dynasty has sent men to our Great Qin Dynasty. It seems that they are here for revenge.” Qin Chuan glanced at Qing Shui and Qin Qing as he reported.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui recalled the Leng Clan only at this moment, he would have had completely forgotten about them if Qin Chuan didn’t bring them up. Qin Qing casually replied, “There are a few people of the Leng Clan who died in our hands. However, they deserved it. Since they came here so quickly, it must mean that they know we were the ones responsible for killing their members.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, there were basically no clues that indicated they were the killers. Since the Leng Clan could investigate it so clearly to the point where they could be confident enough to send men into the Great Qin Dynasty, it meant that the Leng Clan was pretty strong as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are there any movements from them?” Right now Qing Shui’s strength had greatly increased and he was fearless. but he still felt it was best to be more cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They have a very good relationship with the Gu Clan. I’m sure they must have formed an alliance.” Qin Chuan frowned slightly as he spoke.</span></p>

If the two clans truly fought in a bloody clash, it was hard to say who would be victorious and who would be defeated. Now that the Leng Clan had allied with the Gu Clan, they truly mustn’t be careless.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you talking about? Don’t you consider us your family?” Qin Chuan unhappily replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are Qin Qing’s big brother, and that means you are my brother too. I honestly treat you guys as my siblings.” Qing Shui chortled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing lowered her head. She knew what Qing Shui meant by that, and so did everyone here. When they glanced at Qin Qing, they knew that the possibility of them being together was pretty high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! That’s right. Come, let’s drink up!”</span></p>

I don’t want them to interfere. Let us do it ourselves this time.” Qing Shui spoke after thinking for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt that he and Qin Qing were enough. Although Qin Chuan and the rest couldn’t match up to Qin Qing and himself, they were still very powerful experts. Let alone, Qing Shui didn’t really intend to ask for their help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know. But I think the old man and my father should have already known about this though.” Qin Chuan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother, we can handle it. Tell them not to take an action first because if it’s us, the junior generations, who created a mess, it would be easier to handle things as well. Now, there are many people planning to abduct members of the Qin King Manor.” At this moment, Qin Qing added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This news wouldn’t disturb the state of Qing Shui’s heart. He wasn’t afraid at all. His strength had risen so sharply that he was confident he could fend off any attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some time, Qin Chuan and the others returned, leaving behind only Qing Shui and Qin Qing. Right now, both of them were staying in the same pavilion.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was never worried in the past, let alone now. I believe the two of us can handle this.” Qin Qing smiled and spoke in a relaxed tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Husband and wife are both of one heart. Our love and will can even break metal apart.” Qing Shui chortled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In that case, are you delighted and comfortable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A little!” Qing Shui seriously replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Woah, you are so thick-headed.” By now, Qin Qing has already gotten used to Qing Shui’s teasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

There were no movements from neither the Leng Clan nor the Gu Clan, but this felt like the calm before the storm -- the more peaceful things were now, the more Qing Shui and the rest felt like something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the fourth day, Qin Qing received a letter. After reading it, she passed it to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw the unsightly expression on Qin Qing’s face and felt a little worried. He glanced at the letter; there were only a few words on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want Qin Ying to be unharmed, head to the Moonwolf Island before nighttime. Don’t inform people from the Qin King Manor and bring that brat named Qing Shui along. If you don’t do exactly what we want, don’t blame us for not being polite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are starting to act.” Qing Shui savagely tore the letter into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to go there.” Qin Qing spoke in a low voice. “Ying`er is in their hands. If they dare to harm even a strand of hair from her head, I will definitely annihilate them all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go together. We won’t inform the others in your clan. Do you know where the Moonwolf Island is located?” Qing Shui was also worried in his heart. Qin Ying was abducted, and he was truly angered by their willingness to use such a method. It seemed like this time around, they would resort to any means to achieve their goals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moonwolf Island was in the middle of the Great Qin Dynasty and the Sacred Might Dynasty. The Qin King City could be considered the city nearest to the boundaries of the Great Qin Dynasty. It was also the nearest to the Moonwolf Island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, nothing will happen to her.” Qing Shui tried to set Qin Qing’s heart at ease. He knew, he could understand her feelings. But he also knew that they should keep calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moonwolf Island was a stand-alone desolate island with many moon wolves living on it. This was how it got named as such. These moon wolves weren’t very powerful but their numbers were not to be ignored. They were the top of the food chain on the Moonwolf Island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The field view of the Moonwolf Island was excellent. One could see flying birds and walking beasts from distances far away with a single glance. There weren’t many natural covers for people to hide behind.</span></p>
