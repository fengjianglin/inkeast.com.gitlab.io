 <p><strong>AST 938 - Qing Shui’s level of abilities, Tiger Form evolving, Raging Blow</strong></p>
 <p>Sixth Grade of State of Immovable as Mountains!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the soybean sized earthen-yellow pellet. He was incomparably excited. Once the Qi mass formed a pellet, it was considered to be a huge breakthrough. It was a transformation and a huge qualitative change.</p>
 <p>The thing in the middle of his Dantian was the Jindan, condensed from the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Now, it was slightly larger than a walnut. This time, it had changed even further and the strength it now had, made Qing Shui want to laugh. He had never expected such a big change to happen this time.</p>
 <p>The Jindan was in the middle and beside it were two other pellets. One was the size of a toe and the other was the size of a soybean. They were slowly revolving around the Jindan. There was no conflict between them and in fact, they seemed to be in a certain harmony. Like planets revolving around the sun, the system was very mysterious.</p>
 <p>The only revolving Qi mass was the Emperor's Qi. Qing Shui did not know what the change to the Emperor's Qi had been. Nonetheless, it could decrease 20% of the opponent’s abilities. Anyone within his vision could not escape.</p>
 <p>The most important thing that he already knew was that it was impossible to level it up further. That it could not be leveled up further was not a surprising thing. After all, it was already a very tyrannical technique. If it could still be leveled up, Qing Shui would not know what else to say.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled and then looked into his Dantian. He discovered that the revolving violet Qi mass had also turned into a pellet that was about the same size as the Nature Energy pellet, about the size of a toe. The violet color was very pretty, causing one to not want to look away from it.</p>
 <p>It was filled with the Emperor's Qi. As the revolving pellet gave off a purple Qi, it slowly swam into the body, as though it was trying to dye it purple.</p>
 <p>This could also be condensed into a pellet...</p>
 <p>Now, there were four pellets in his Dantian. However, the one made from the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was the largest. The others were quite small. This made it look more harmonious. The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique Jindan was in the middle, golden-bright and dazzling. The Nature Energy was golden-bright and dazzling as well, but it was much smaller. The State of Immovable as Mountains was earthen-yellow in color and was also smaller. The Emperor's Qi was violet in color and looked very obvious in the Dantian. It looked proud and aloof, because although the Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains were close to each other, the Emperor's Qi seemed lonely.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Jindan that had grown slightly larger, the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique Jindan. Then, he tried slowly circulating it. A surging energy came rushing from it, causing Qing Shui to feel excited because it had been strengthened significantly again. Although it was not enough for Qing Shui to go crazy, he was still very excited.</p>
 <p>20 Stars!</p>
 <p>Right now, the abilities of Qing Shui reached 90 stars. He was getting close to 100 stars.</p>
 <p>Having the abilities of 100 stars was the weakest level of abilities for a Martial Emperor. 1000 stars was the Grand Perfection Stage, signifying a Grade One Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not expected that there would be such an effect when the State of Immovable as Mountains broke through to the sixth grade. He could actually use this steady aura to cause the other Qi’s to condense into a pellet.</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains both went up by a grade. Based on their original principles, they should increase the body’s abilities by another 10%.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection, and Diamond Crossing Rivers circulated automatically!</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy circulated automatically too!</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>High Grade Focused Concentration!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly circulated all his abilities. The Nature Energy increased 70% of the body’s abilities, the State of Immovable as Mountains increased 60% of the body’s abilities…...</p>
 <p>Circulating his abilities to their peaks and adding on the Heavenly Talisman, Qing Shui’s abilities without any weapons was already at 430 stars. He had to use weapons in order to execute the Combination Sword Technique.</p>
 <p>Holding the Violet Star Thunder God, Qing Shui’s abilities increased to 1300 stars. This included the feedback from the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. This was just Qing Shui’s base abilities, not taking into account the Raging Blow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui brandished the Violet Star Thunder God in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was stunned after discovering that his hammer techniques had undergone a small change.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as if he had the stability of a large established clan.</p>
 <p>State of Immovable as Mountains!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this was the effect of State of Immovable as Mountains, a kind of mental state akin to that of immovable mountains. Now, it could be considered that he had stepped through the threshold of the true Mental State of Immovable as Mountains.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s figure kept flickering in mid-air. The Violet Star Thunder God no longer felt as heavy as it had in the past. There was none of the clumsiness of a hammer type weapon.</p>
 <p>Naturally, his speed had also increased. The Violet Star Thunder God added 10% to his speed. After practicing for a bit, Qing Shui was delighted to discover that he could use the Raging Blow whenever he wanted.</p>
 <p>However, the Raging Blow exhausted a lot of energy. The burden on his body would be too big if he kept on using it continuously. However, that was not too important. The most important thing was that he could use it any time. The Raging Blow would be his strongest battle technique.</p>
 <p>At his current realm, he could double his damage, having 2600 stars of strength!</p>
 <p>This would be one of Qing Shui’s trump cards. Although he already had the Raging Blow in the past, he was not able to use it in battle. It was like dying of hunger while guarding a gold mountain.</p>
 <p>[TL notes: Dying of hunger while guarding a gold mountain, means it is precious, but not useful in the current situation]</p>
 <p>Before, it was like guarding a gold mountain on a desolate island. Now it was like bringing the gold mountain to a bustling city. The feeling was indescribable.</p>
 <p>The excited Qing Shui brandished the Violet Star Thunder God in midair. A ball of black light dispersed, accompanied by a loud explosive sound. The sound was very resounding, but Qing Shui did not feel anything. However, he knew that it would definitely affect any opponent.</p>
 <p>After brandishing it for two hours, Qing Shui stopped. That uninhibited, carefree feeling caused him to feel an indescribable happiness. Then he toss aside the Violet Star Thunder God that was in his hands.</p>
 <p>Tiger Form!</p>
 <p>He no longer knew what realm his Tiger Form was in.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Just by taking up a stance, there was a shocking roar. The sound resembled that of a beast king roaring on top of the mountain. It was not echoed very far, but it was full of a strong oppressive might. It seemed like it was ringing in his heart.</p>
 <p>Deterrence!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was sure that in his heart, he had comprehended the aura of the State of Immovable as Mountains when he had looked at the Tiger Form inscription steele. When the State of Immovable as Mountains had reached the sixth grade, he had guessed that the Tiger Form would also have some changes.</p>
 <p>Tiger Laceration!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly waved his hands and was immediately stunned by the three-foot long golden energy claws that appeared in front of his hands.</p>
 <p>Tiger Claws!</p>
 <p>Taking Form!</p>
 <p>Tiger Form Taking Form!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood there and stared blankly for a long time. Then he rapidly struck out. Tiger Claws, Hunting Tiger Claw, Ripping Tiger Claw…...</p>
 <p>Every move he used resulted in a golden claw condensed from the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique appearing in front of him, just like that man hitting out at the Jasper Quartz Jiao in the Poison Mountain Stockade.</p>
 <p>He could feel that the might he struck out with was very strong. Qing Shui discovered that the Nature Energy and the aura of the State of Immovable as Mountains were both merged into this attack. The strength of the Nature Energy was in no doubt and this strike seemed to contain the might of Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>The might of this Tiger Form actually raised his abilities by one fold. Without a weapon, the Tiger Form achieved an attack of nearly 900 stars.</p>
 <p>What an unexpected surprise. One mysterious fruit could actually cause a chain of reactions resulting in an explosive increase in his abilities. The most important thing was that Qing Shui discovered that his foundation was very stable. It was unlike most other explosive increase in abilities, where the foundation would be shaky. If that was the case, getting stronger so quickly would not be a good thing.</p>
 <p>All of this was related to the State of Immovable as Mountains. The sixth grade was a particularly important threshold. Qing Shui had never expected this. The State of Immovable as Mountains could actually have such miraculous effects and did not seem inferior to the Nature Energy.</p>
 <p>He spent another hour on the Tiger Form.</p>
 <p>There were too many surprises today already. Qing Shui felt that it was too much, as though he was in a dream. He stared blankly for awhile before breaking out in laughter. Although his abilities now were pretty strong, he knew the abilities of a Martial Emperor. With his full force, he could just barely attack with the power of an ordinary Grade Three Martial Emperor. After all, he could not keep on using the Raging Blow, as it exhausted too much energy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finally looked at the Emperor's Qi that had condensed into a pellet, to see what the changes were.</p>
 <p>With a look, Qing Shui was quite happy. The distance the Emperor's Qi could activate over had increased. Furthermore, he could affect multiple targets in a small area by using his Spiritual Sense.</p>
 <p>This was a significant improvement. Before, he could only target one opponent at a time. Furthermore, the total number of uses was limited. It was a good thing that it could not be evaded. However, although he hadn’t needed to use it too many times before, the time it lasted and its cooldown were pretty decent. Unfortunately, he had only been able to weaken the strongest experts first.</p>
 <p>Now, the total number of targets the Emperor's Qi could work on at one time had increased. He had not expected that it would have such a change after it turned into a pellet. Overall, it was very good, as he hadn’t expected there would be such a change with the Emperor's Qi.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The second day, Qing Shui got up very early and did his morning practice. There were no changes to his Taichi Fist. It would probably take a lot of effort before it could Take Form. It seemed that the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique should be at least a legendary level technique.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Qing Shui did not understand why when he had used the Tiger Form, only the Tiger Claws had appeared. Qing Shui did not think it was because his realm was too low. He knew that that man from the Poison Mountain Stockade was not higher than him in terms of realm.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the Poison Mountain Stockade, Qing Shui thought of the Mu Clan. Although he had only left for a day, he already missed Mu Qing. He remembered the first time he saw her, the time he went to Sky Penetrating Mountains, her ten Treasure Hunting Pigs, Lightning Bees, Golden Beasts…</p>
 <p>After he had confirmed their relationship, he had given her a lot of medicinal pills. Of course, these included the ones that raised the strength of her Demonic Beasts. Those few Golden Beasts were also part of a mutated species. The Golden Beast did not have the bloodline of any Demonic Beast. Qing Shui’s pill would allow them to awaken their bloodline and stimulate their potential.</p>
 <p>Thus, Qing Shui was not very worried when he left. Those Golden Beasts would be very strong in the future. Back then, under the effect of that ‘pearl’, their strength had undergone an explosive increase.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that those pigs with the sturdiness of heavy metal did not have any attacking capabilities.</p>
 <p>When he came back, he was just in time to see Yu He walk out of her room. Seeing Qing Shui coming back from outside, she smiled, “Did your practice?”</p>
 <p>“En! Had a good sleep?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“En, let’s go down and have something to eat!”</p>
 <p>“Sure, wait for me!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked into the room and washed himself up. Then, he came out and went down with Yu He. Their room was on the highest floor. This had been specially requested by Qing Shui when he had ordered the rooms.</p>
 <p>They found seats in the corner of the great hall. There were not many people here in the morning. Soon, a waiter came over and brought them breakfast.</p>
 <p>Breakfast did not have to be ordered, as it was the same for everyone. Of course, they could also order some other dishes.</p>
 <p>Seeing the expression on the waiter’s face, Qing Shui knew that he was aware of his and Yu He’s identity.</p>
