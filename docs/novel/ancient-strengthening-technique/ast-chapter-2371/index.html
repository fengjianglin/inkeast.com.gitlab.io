 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2371 - Ten Caves, The Cave Realm’s Strongest</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the killing had started, there was no reason to let the rest go. After killing the last of them, Priest Purewood arrived. Upon witnessing the scene, he immediately destroyed the corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did Qing Shui not get surprised, he even laughed at this sight, “Many thanks for the help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sentence felt implicating but Priest Purewood did not seem to care at all. He looked at Qing Shui and said, “Sir Qing, your strength amazes me. You have already reached such a height at your age. Your future will truly be boundless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is your second time giving me words of blessings.” Qing Shui laughed without disagreeing, but also without acknowledgment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was just praising you the last time, but this time I’m not doing that. The Demon Gate’s people are always excessively arrogant, not putting others in their sights. However, you still have to be careful of the Nine Continents’ Demon Gate.” Priest Purewood said as he scoured around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mm, this junior will keep that in mind,” Qing Shui replied seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, that is good. Let us return then. We shall continue tomorrow. I’m here today to find a certain something to make a breakthrough. I think I still need your help for that.” Priest Purewood laughed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Definitely!” Qing Shui did not decline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui applied the Ninth Heavenly Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. He then took out his Heaven Healing Stone, intending to use it and break through the Ancient Strengthening Technique’s Ninth Layer. If he were able to achieve the Tenth Heavenly layer, he would have a huge increase in power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just the thought of it made him want to give up. The chances of achieving the Tenth layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was far too slim. After all, it would require one to break through the shackles of legends. There was too little hope for him so with just one stone, it was better to use it on a technique with a greater chance of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Qing Shui planned to make an all-out effort to achieve the Tenth Cave. If he managed to do so, it would be a big breakthrough in strength. More importantly, he would then be able to try to break through the Cave Realm, further increasing his strength. It would be like qualitatively changing one’s weapons or armor in a game.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arm Extension!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui’s hand, which was as shiny and white as jade, seemed as though it was turning transparent. He held the Heaven Healing stone and slowly used its godly force. A thread of mystical power was ignited which then rushed into Qing Shui’s body, traveling through his meridians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A layer of pale golden light arose, enveloping Qing Shui’s body and giving him an aura of dignity and of holy authority. As time passed, the stone’s powers were slowly being transferred to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Open!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first golden cave opened behind Qing Shui. An enormous stream of energy then came spewing out from that deep cave which had unknown amounts of energy. They kept opening up one after another, until Qing Shui had nine golden caves bursting with energy behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It did not stop after nine. The shadow of a void appeared behind Qing Shui. It was slightly further away compared to the other nine, and its shape seemed somewhat different. This Cave’s outline seemed slightly thicker, and seemed more impressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The caves before Qing Shui had all become golden, and it was after gold refinement. Similar, yet heavier than the average cave, the tenth cave’s outline was even thicker. It was not even gold, more so without gold refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though it was just a shadow, it had begun to grow clearer. Qing Shui didn’t dare to let up, focusing all of his efforts onto opening the cave by gathering all of his strength and launching it straight at the tenth cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once, twice……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a stone thrown into the sea. There was not much of an effect, but Qing Shui knew that this was to be expected. If the tenth cave was easy to open then there wouldn’t just be those few experts throughout history attaining this state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time slowly slipped away as Qing Shui was like a monk meditating. His body slowly became unable to withstand the exertion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Healing stone in his hand became smaller and smaller, and he did not know how long it would be before it was used up. If he still could not fully open the tenth cave before it was used up, it would have all been in vain; he would even face the rebound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, Qing Shui felt numb, and the Heaven Healing stone in his hand disappeared in a halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tenth cave had basically opened up already. The difference between it and the other caves was like the massive difference between a male and a female lion. Furthermore, the tenth cave opened up by itself, behind the other nine caves, not deigning to appear in a row together with the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui gathered all his energy once again for the umpteenth time with the Heaven Healing Stone all but gone. If this last surge did not work, this would have been all for naught.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Power of the Shield Attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Power of Rebirth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui gathered all the energy he could muster on this attempt. He then used his body to converge the surging power and transferred the energy from the Nine Caves to his body. His body was just like a ticking bomb at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were no outsiders in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Otherwise, they would be shocked to see Qing Shui at this status. His body was larger by a whole layer, and he looked like ripples traveling through water. Qing Shui’s body was sturdy enough to not be blown up long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">GO!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui blasted at the tenth cave with all the energy he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was neither hesitation nor reservation. Just like rivers endlessly flooding, an entire gush of energy stormed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui fell unconscious shortly after, something that had not happened in a long time, a fact that he found strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After some time, Qing Shui regained consciousness and saw that he was still in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, meaning that his time in the Realm had not been used up. He sighed in relief, and was anxious to test his power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His power had risen…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had a spurt of excitement. His strength had risen! He had been successful in opening the tenth cave! His strength would only have risen if it was opened successfully. If he had failed instead, he would have been in a weakened state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tenth cave. Qing Shui got excited at his mere imagination of it. In history, those who managed to open the tenth cave were all extremely powerful existences. Furthermore, Qing Shui’s tenth cave was about to turn gold as well, making him even more mighty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had willed it, and the caves behind him burst forth into the void. First one, second one…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tenth one appeared and its magnificent and golden facade showed how it was much more overbearing compared to the rest. Golden rays circled around intensely on top of it. It was much more good-hearted than the other caves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden cave. This made Qing Shui happy beyond words. This was amazing. He could now directly use the ancient book of “Gold Cave Refinement” for gold refinement, allowing the Cave Realm to be perfect now. He could then start searching for his breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gold refinement for caves did not require much time. He could start once he thought of it. Qing Shui then started gold refinement for the tenth cave with no time to waste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tenth cave’s gold refinement required three times the amount of time required for the other caves, but Qing Shui saw it as a good thing. Gold Refinement had no chance of failure, and would greatly boost one’s power. The sight of ten glorious and magnificent golden caves gave him great pleasure, as he felt an unprecedented sense of accomplishment.</span></p>
