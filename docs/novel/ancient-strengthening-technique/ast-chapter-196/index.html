  <p><strong>AST 196 – Cannot forget you, Bear Form of the Nine Animal Mimicry Technique</strong></p>
  <p>Quickly, the two women returned, but the familiar image of Wu-shuang didn’t appear. Qing Shui was a little dazed!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t know why, but he felt his heart sinking again. He quietly looked at the woman across from him. He wanted to know why. </p>
  <p>“Protector Wu-shuang said she was busy and that she couldn’t see Elder Qing Shui. She also said for Elder Qing Shui to not look for her again.” A girl said quietly; she was also looking at Qing Shui strangely.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui now felt very perplexed. In his previous life, he came from a rural area, and he didn’t have money or strength. He also had no talent or anything worth showing off, so he always felt felt inferior. He would not compete with others, and he wouldn’t even dare to think about taking the initiative in pursuing women. The prettier and more superior a woman was, the more Qing Shui avoided them. He also didn’t know how to tell a woman to stay with him or how to deceive her because he felt love could not be forced. </p>
  <p>Before he started cultivating in this life, he was a useless person. His broken and inferior heart further deteriorated before cultivation. Even now, he still lacked confidence in front of a woman, but his self-esteem was very high. </p>
  <p>He didn’t understand women. Who could say that he understood women? Although Qing Shui’s strength was incomparable, he didn’t like to struggle or force another to stay. He liked and believed that success would follow naturally. He just let nature take its course, like how he did with Mingyue Gelou and Shi Qingzhuang. </p>
  <p>When something was related to a person, it would affect that person’s thinking and decisions. Qing Shui even thought about the possibility that Wenren Wu-shuang liked another person after he left for half a year. After all, the Skysword Sect was not like the Hundred Miles City. There were a lot more Xiantian men here, and of those, there was an abundance of handsome and mature experts. </p>
  <p>A person who lacked self-confidence was especially weak in the matters of love. Qing Shui stood there in a daze. The others did not dare to disturb and just looked at Qing Shui staring blankly into space.</p>
  <p>After a long time, Qing Shui finally took a glance at Zhu Qing Peak. What could she not tell me directly? She didn’t even want to see me. How did it come to this? If you found another person you liked, you can just tell me. I was just joking and teasing her last time about snatching her back.</p>
  <p>He laughed at himself, then completely turned around as if he wanted to erase everything that belonged to her. He made long strides on the way back. At this moment, he felt completely defeated. </p>
  <p>“Are you really just going to forget me like this? I refuse to accept it!” Qing Shui didn’t take many steps before he turned and heard a familiar voice in front of him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui lifted his head happily and saw Wenren Wu-shuang looking at him bitterly. Qing Shui’s heart warmed; he walked towards her and hugged her so tightly as if she was the most precious thing. It was as though he was scared she might disappear again. </p>
  <p>“I tried my best to forget you all night yesterday, but I couldn’t do it. I won’t let you forget me.” Wenren Wu-shuang hugged Qing Shui’s neck and said softly. </p>
  <p>At this moment, Qing Shui’s elated mood didn’t let him say anything as he felt like he regained something he lost. He just hugged her tightly as if he wanted to knead her into his body. He didn’t even have any dirty thoughts. </p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you’re strangling me.” Wenren Wu-shuang said angrily at Qing Shui’s ear. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui loosened his grip a little and focused on that exceptional countenance that was a little thin and pallid. “When I get tired, I will let you go. It doesn’t matter how much I suffer, I will respect your everything. To be honest, I really want to have you all to myself. Even if you didn’t like me, I didn’t want to let you go, but I didn’t want to see you unhappy.”</p>
  <p>She hugged Qing Shui’s neck and listened to Qing Shui’s words. The resentment that she had also dissipated slowly. She looked up and admired that delicate and serious pair of eyes.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was startled, and he looked at Wenren Wu-shuang’s slightly flushed face. It was so beautiful and enticing, but he held himself back from any rash actions.</p>
  <p>“I want to kiss you.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the beauty in front of his eyes dumbly. He really thought he was deaf. He remembered how he let Shi Qingzhuang kiss him a few days before, but he didn’t get the kiss in the end. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui lowered his head and kissed those sexy and slightly pouted lips. They felt soft and sweet. He kept those gentle and plump lips in his mouth and pulled on it lightly, sucking on them!</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang only knew to hug Qing Shui’s neck tightly. Her loveable face was dark red, and she kept her jaws tightly closed. Qing Shui really couldn’t part her teeth, so he could only lick and suck her flower-like lips. </p>
  <p>That feeling was nevertheless splendid, especially when he admired that captivating and blushing face as he looked at her exquisite skin closely. She had a beauty that could shake one to the core.</p>
  <p>He left a string of kisses on her cheeks, her forehead, and her tall and beautiful nose. One of his hands suddenly climbed on and grabbed that round, perky, and bouncy butt.</p>
  <p>“Ah!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s evil plan worked, and he kissed those sweet lips again. His tongue made its way to wrap around Wenren Wu-shuang’s lilac tongue. He sucked the bodily fluid inside her mouth, but he only had the chance to do it for a short moment. Wenren Wu-shuang’s body trembled, and Qing Shui felt a wave of pain on his tongue. </p>
  <p>“I’m sorry, since you touched my… I panicked and bit down.” Wenren Wu-shuang said guiltily and looked at Qing Shui, who was smiling bitterly and had some blood on the corner of his mouth.</p>
  <p>“You didn’t bleed on your first time. I bled.” Qing Shui forced a smile and wiped the blood on his mouth.</p>
  <p>After all, Wenren Wu-shuang lived for a long time at Night Fragrance Court, so she knew about these kinds of things. When she heard Qing Shui teasing her, she almost said, “Did I not bite you hard enough? You are still continuing your smooth-talking.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at that little woman and hugged her again to kiss her beautiful lips. She yelped a little, but this time, it was much easier to put his tongue into Wenren Wu-shuang’s mouth and suck her tiny tongue into his mouth. He bit it softly, then loosened it to let her escape in a panic. Qing Shui again extended his tongue inside her mouth to suck her tongue back, let it escape, and suck it back…</p>
  <p>“If I didn’t come here, would you really leave me like this and never try to find me again?” Wenren Wu-shuang held Qing Shui’s hand and walked slowly through the snow. </p>
  <p>“I don’t know; I even thought of rushing into Zhu Qing Peak to see you a moment ago. I thought that you found another man who is better than me. To be honest, I don’t have much confidence in myself, and I feel like I can’t catch you.” Qing Shui lifted Wenren Wu-shuang and carried her like a princess, making her scream. However, she quickly curled up inside Qing Shui’s embrace.</p>
  <p>“After you detoxified me that time, would I have any other choice? Even if I don’t choose you, I will remain single. At the time, I felt that you were small, though a little magical. However, I still saw you as a boy. Later on, I found that you grew up and matured. I was really happy, but the number of women also started growing.” Wenren Wu-shuang said as if she was sleep talking. </p>
  <p>“Sometimes, these things are really out of my control. Humans can really be helpless in many situations. Wu-shuang, I am serious about you. I already know I am greedy.” Qing Shui said helplessly. He did not want to give up Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, or Wenren Wu-shuang. </p>
  <p>“You don’t have to be like this, or else you will be so frustrated in the future. A competent man will not have a lack of women, and you will have even more women in the future. Are you happy?” Wenren Wu-shuang jumped out of Qing Shui’s embrace and said oddly. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “Only a foolish woman like you would fall for me.”</p>
  <p>On the first day of Chinese New Year, Qing Shui spent time with Wenren Wu-shuang as if they were on a scenic tour. During the time, Qing Shui kissed Wenren Wu-shuang at least ten times, making Wenren Wu-shuang blush. </p>
  <p>He didn’t think that once they started a little physical contact with each other and when Qing Shui knew about Wenren Wu-shuang’s thoughts, their relationship became steady. His hands also silently received many benefits, especially with that round and beautifully curved butt. She let Qing Shui’s hands take advantage of it. </p>
  <p>“You are still touching it?” Wenren Wu-shuang looked at the hand that was stroking her butt. </p>
  <p>When they returned to Cloud Mist Peak, a day had almost passed. After he hastily finished eating with Yiye Jiange and the little girl, Qing Shui returned to his room and directly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui, who had reached the large success stage for Deer Cantering and the Tiger Form, was ready to learn the Bear Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique! </p>
  <p>The Bear Form was powerful yet steady, but the usage of strength and power was especially important. It was clumsy yet skillful, a technique that used strength for victories. It included Bear Lunge, Bear Stance, Bear Dazzle, and Bear Lean!</p>
  <p>Similarly, the Bear Form had its own unique way of channeling Qi. The only thing that surprised Qing Shui was that this technique of channeling Qi didn’t even have a name, but it was extremely strong. Reaching the small success stage could increase one’s strength by a thousand Jin. Three thousand Jin would be reached for the large success stage, and ten thousand Jin for the great perfection stage. Qing Shui knew the difficulty must be greater than the Tiger Form and Deer Cantering.</p>
  <p>The style of the Bear Form seemed clumsy, but its strength was firm and ferocious. This was due to its technique of channeling Qi and the effect of its techniques, especially Bear Lunge, Bear Dazzle, and Bear Lean. Those techniques plus the technique of channeling Qi would give even an average person incredible strength once he mastered its essence. </p>
  <p>The only shortcoming was that its speed was a little slow. This was for the purpose of accumulating that mountain-like strength and foundation, and creating a feeling of a motionless mountain. </p>
  <p>If he could reach the large success stage of the Bear Form and use his strength to demonstrate the great killing techniques of the Bear Form, the effect must be impressive. If he could also appropriately channel the sturdy body and incredible strength that the Ancient Strengthening Technique gave, he could win even if he just fought another using only his strength. These techniques could also blend especially well into his earth attribute Xiantian Qi. </p>
  <p>Everything was most difficult at the start. Qing Shui tried to use the Qi channeling technique for the Bear Form. It was hard to understand and very strange. Qing Shui found the Bear Form to be much more difficult to master than Deer Cantering or the Tiger Form. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui speculated that the future, more advanced kinds of the Nine Animal Mimicry Technique would be even harder to master. Just the supplementary attribute for this Nine Animal Mimicry Technique already made it significantly impressive. Qing Shui again admired the formidable strength of supplementary skills and the powerful usage of battle techniques. </p>
  <p>He tried to channel the Qi again and again, and he slowly started to move the Qi in his body. The automatically cycling Ancient Strengthening Technique seemed like an instinct in his body, and it wouldn’t interfere with any other skills. It would only support them like a shield. </p>
  <p>He practiced channeling the Qi. When he was hungry, he made something to eat in the spatial realm. He even made a pot of soup and slowly heated it on the fire, keeping it at a simmering temperature so that he could drink it at any time. </p>
  <p>With the help of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui was able reduce his work by a half to maintain good health. However, only after ten days did Qing Shui slowly get the gist of it. He also barely managed to use the technique to channel the Qi through his body. Qing Shui felt as if his body weighed a thousand JIn. Although a thousand Jin was nothing to Qing Shui, this one thousand Jin originating from his own body made him feel very clumsy. He felt a little stiff, but his strength definitely increased a lot. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that he was already at the elementary level for the Bear Form. Qing Shui was very happy. Qing Shui kept himself in the Bear Form state and used some simple skills for the Bear Form. He couldn’t learn the skills that had a strong killing power until he reached the small success stage. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui even attempted to add the Tiger’s Roar to the Bear Form or use the Tiger Form while in the state of the Bear Form. Unfortunately, wishes were beautiful, but reality was cruel. However, Qing shui believed he could successfully combine them in the future. </p>
  <p>This was so until Qing Shui was kicked out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p>On the second day of New Year, the Skysword Sect became even colder than the day before. The snow started dropping again after it had fallen for half of yesterday. The dancing snowflakes were big and beautiful.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui used the Bear Form clumsily in the snow, but it was much better than when he began. Qing Shui secretly congratulated himself!</p>
  <p>“Hehe, mother, look at daddy! He looks like a black bear.”</p>
  <p>The crisp sound of laughing and talking mixed with Yiye Jiange’s unordinary laughter. Qing Shui looked at the two devastatingly beautiful goddess and loli helplessly. </p>
  <p>“Luan Luan, during this time, you need to learn this Black Bear Form.” Qing Shui laughed and lifted the little girl in his arms.</p>
  <p>“I won’t learn it! I won’t learn it! It’s so ugly!” Luan Luan’s head shook like a rattle-drum and yelled that she wouldn’t learn it! </p>
  <p>Qing Shui was not scared that she wouldn’t learn it. When the little girl would cultivate the Bear Form, she definitely wouldn’t know if it was the Bear Form. In addition, she couldn’t see whether or not she was a “little black bear.” Only the people next to her could see. </p>
  <p>“Ok ok, we won’t learn it! We won’t learn it!” Qing Shui kissed that beautiful apple-like cheek!</p>
  <p>Once Luan Luan heard that she didn’t need to learn it, she immediately became happy and nibbled on Qing Shui’s nose. Her giggle even made Yiye Jiange unable to suppress her laughter.</p>
  <p>“Master, if you don’t mind, would it be fine if you will learn something together with me?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said, a little embarrassed. </p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange was also surprised. She then smiled and said, “Sure, you can’t keep any secrets to yourself!”</p>
  <p>“Why would I? For you, I would want to give twelve even if I only had ten.” Qing Shui chuckled. </p>
  <p>When Yiye Jiange heard Qing Shui’s words, her light smile didn’t change, but she felt a little sweetness in her heart. Qing Shui’s caring thoughts for her were like the drizzling rain, digging into her heart soundlessly. </p>

He also didn’t know how to tell a woman to stay with him or how to deceive her because he felt love could not be forced. </p>
 <p>Before he started cultivating in this life, he was a useless person. His broken and inferior heart further deteriorated before cultivation. Even now, he still lacked confidence in front of a woman, but his self-esteem was very high. </p>
 <p>He didn’t understand women. Who could say that he understood women? Although Qing Shui’s strength was incomparable, he didn’t like to struggle or force another to stay. He liked and believed that success would follow naturally. He just let nature take its course, like how he did with Mingyue Gelou and Shi Qingzhuang. </p>
 <p>When something was related to a person, it would affect that person’s thinking and decisions. Qing Shui even thought about the possibility that Wenren Wu-shuang liked another person after he left for half a year. After all, the Skysword Sect was not like the Hundred Miles City. There were a lot more Xiantian men here, and of those, there was an abundance of handsome and mature experts. </p>
 <p>A person who lacked self-confidence was especially weak in the matters of love. Qing Shui stood there in a daze. The others did not dare to disturb and just looked at Qing Shui staring blankly into space.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Qing Shui finally took a glance at Zhu Qing Peak. What could she not tell me directly? She didn’t even want to see me. How did it come to this? If you found another person you liked, you can just tell me. I was just joking and teasing her last time about snatching her back.</p>
 <p>He laughed at himself, then completely turned around as if he wanted to erase everything that belonged to her. He made long strides on the way back. At this moment, he felt completely defeated. </p>
 <p>“Are you really just going to forget me like this? I refuse to accept it!” Qing Shui didn’t take many steps before he turned and heard a familiar voice in front of him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted his head happily and saw Wenren Wu-shuang looking at him bitterly. Qing Shui’s heart warmed; he walked towards her and hugged her so tightly as if she was the most precious thing. It was as though he was scared she might disappear again. </p>
 <p>“I tried my best to forget you all night yesterday, but I couldn’t do it. I won’t let you forget me.” Wenren Wu-shuang hugged Qing Shui’s neck and said softly. </p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui’s elated mood didn’t let him say anything as he felt like he regained something he lost. He just hugged her tightly as if he wanted to knead her into his body. He didn’t even have any dirty thoughts. </p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you’re strangling me.” Wenren Wu-shuang said angrily at Qing Shui’s ear. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui loosened his grip a little and focused on that exceptional countenance that was a little thin and pallid. “When I get tired, I will let you go. It doesn’t matter how much I suffer, I will respect your everything. To be honest, I really want to have you all to myself. Even if you didn’t like me, I didn’t want to let you go, but I didn’t want to see you unhappy.”</p>
 <p>She hugged Qing Shui’s neck and listened to Qing Shui’s words. The resentment that she had also dissipated slowly. She looked up and admired that delicate and serious pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled, and he looked at Wenren Wu-shuang’s slightly flushed face. It was so beautiful and enticing, but he held himself back from any rash actions.</p>
 <p>“I want to kiss you.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the beauty in front of his eyes dumbly. He really thought he was deaf. He remembered how he let Shi Qingzhuang kiss him a few days before, but he didn’t get the kiss in the end. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui lowered his head and kissed those sexy and slightly pouted lips. They felt soft and sweet. He kept those gentle and plump lips in his mouth and pulled on it lightly, sucking on them!</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang only knew to hug Qing Shui’s neck tightly. Her loveable face was dark red, and she kept her jaws tightly closed. Qing Shui really couldn’t part her teeth, so he could only lick and suck her flower-like lips. </p>
 <p>That feeling was nevertheless splendid, especially when he admired that captivating and blushing face as he looked at her exquisite skin closely. She had a beauty that could shake one to the core.</p>
 <p>He left a string of kisses on her cheeks, her forehead, and her tall and beautiful nose. One of his hands suddenly climbed on and grabbed that round, perky, and bouncy butt.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s evil plan worked, and he kissed those sweet lips again. His tongue made its way to wrap around Wenren Wu-shuang’s lilac tongue. He sucked the bodily fluid inside her mouth, but he only had the chance to do it for a short moment. Wenren Wu-shuang’s body trembled, and Qing Shui felt a wave of pain on his tongue. </p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, since you touched my… I panicked and bit down.” Wenren Wu-shuang said guiltily and looked at Qing Shui, who was smiling bitterly and had some blood on the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“You didn’t bleed on your first time. I bled.” Qing Shui forced a smile and wiped the blood on his mouth.</p>
 <p>After all, Wenren Wu-shuang lived for a long time at Night Fragrance Court, so she knew about these kinds of things. When she heard Qing Shui teasing her, she almost said, “Did I not bite you hard enough? You are still continuing your smooth-talking.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at that little woman and hugged her again to kiss her beautiful lips. She yelped a little, but this time, it was much easier to put his tongue into Wenren Wu-shuang’s mouth and suck her tiny tongue into his mouth. He bit it softly, then loosened it to let her escape in a panic. Qing Shui again extended his tongue inside her mouth to suck her tongue back, let it escape, and suck it back…</p>
 <p>“If I didn’t come here, would you really leave me like this and never try to find me again?” Wenren Wu-shuang held Qing Shui’s hand and walked slowly through the snow. </p>
 <p>“I don’t know; I even thought of rushing into Zhu Qing Peak to see you a moment ago. I thought that you found another man who is better than me. To be honest, I don’t have much confidence in myself, and I feel like I can’t catch you.” Qing Shui lifted Wenren Wu-shuang and carried her like a princess, making her scream. However, she quickly curled up inside Qing Shui’s embrace.</p>
 <p>“After you detoxified me that time, would I have any other choice? Even if I don’t choose you, I will remain single. At the time, I felt that you were small, though a little magical. However, I still saw you as a boy. Later on, I found that you grew up and matured. I was really happy, but the number of women also started growing.” Wenren Wu-shuang said as if she was sleep talking. </p>
 <p>“Sometimes, these things are really out of my control. Humans can really be helpless in many situations. Wu-shuang, I am serious about you. I already know I am greedy.” Qing Shui said helplessly. He did not want to give up Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, or Wenren Wu-shuang. </p>
 <p>“You don’t have to be like this, or else you will be so frustrated in the future. A competent man will not have a lack of women, and you will have even more women in the future. Are you happy?” Wenren Wu-shuang jumped out of Qing Shui’s embrace and said oddly. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “Only a foolish woman like you would fall for me.”</p>
 <p>On the first day of Chinese New Year, Qing Shui spent time with Wenren Wu-shuang as if they were on a scenic tour. During the time, Qing Shui kissed Wenren Wu-shuang at least ten times, making Wenren Wu-shuang blush. </p>
 <p>He didn’t think that once they started a little physical contact with each other and when Qing Shui knew about Wenren Wu-shuang’s thoughts, their relationship became steady. His hands also silently received many benefits, especially with that round and beautifully curved butt. She let Qing Shui’s hands take advantage of it. </p>
 <p>“You are still touching it?” Wenren Wu-shuang looked at the hand that was stroking her butt. </p>
 <p>When they returned to Cloud Mist Peak, a day had almost passed. After he hastily finished eating with Yiye Jiange and the little girl, Qing Shui returned to his room and directly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who had reached the large success stage for Deer Cantering and the Tiger Form, was ready to learn the Bear Form of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique! </p>
 <p>The Bear Form was powerful yet steady, but the usage of strength and power was especially important. It was clumsy yet skillful, a technique that used strength for victories. It included Bear Lunge, Bear Stance, Bear Dazzle, and Bear Lean!</p>
 <p>Similarly, the Bear Form had its own unique way of channeling Qi. The only thing that surprised Qing Shui was that this technique of channeling Qi didn’t even have a name, but it was extremely strong. Reaching the small success stage could increase one’s strength by a thousand Jin. Three thousand Jin would be reached for the large success stage, and ten thousand Jin for the great perfection stage. Qing Shui knew the difficulty must be greater than the Tiger Form and Deer Cantering.</p>
 <p>The style of the Bear Form seemed clumsy, but its strength was firm and ferocious. This was due to its technique of channeling Qi and the effect of its techniques, especially Bear Lunge, Bear Dazzle, and Bear Lean. Those techniques plus the technique of channeling Qi would give even an average person incredible strength once he mastered its essence. </p>
 <p>The only shortcoming was that its speed was a little slow. This was for the purpose of accumulating that mountain-like strength and foundation, and creating a feeling of a motionless mountain. </p>
 <p>If he could reach the large success stage of the Bear Form and use his strength to demonstrate the great killing techniques of the Bear Form, the effect must be impressive. If he could also appropriately channel the sturdy body and incredible strength that the Ancient Strengthening Technique gave, he could win even if he just fought another using only his strength. These techniques could also blend especially well into his earth attribute Xiantian Qi. </p>
 <p>Everything was most difficult at the start. Qing Shui tried to use the Qi channeling technique for the Bear Form. It was hard to understand and very strange. Qing Shui found the Bear Form to be much more difficult to master than Deer Cantering or the Tiger Form. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui speculated that the future, more advanced kinds of the Nine Animal Mimicry Technique would be even harder to master. Just the supplementary attribute for this Nine Animal Mimicry Technique already made it significantly impressive. Qing Shui again admired the formidable strength of supplementary skills and the powerful usage of battle techniques. </p>
 <p>He tried to channel the Qi again and again, and he slowly started to move the Qi in his body. The automatically cycling Ancient Strengthening Technique seemed like an instinct in his body, and it wouldn’t interfere with any other skills. It would only support them like a shield. </p>
 <p>He practiced channeling the Qi. When he was hungry, he made something to eat in the spatial realm. He even made a pot of soup and slowly heated it on the fire, keeping it at a simmering temperature so that he could drink it at any time. </p>
 <p>With the help of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui was able reduce his work by a half to maintain good health. However, only after ten days did Qing Shui slowly get the gist of it. He also barely managed to use the technique to channel the Qi through his body. Qing Shui felt as if his body weighed a thousand JIn. Although a thousand Jin was nothing to Qing Shui, this one thousand Jin originating from his own body made him feel very clumsy. He felt a little stiff, but his strength definitely increased a lot. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he was already at the elementary level for the Bear Form. Qing Shui was very happy. Qing Shui kept himself in the Bear Form state and used some simple skills for the Bear Form. He couldn’t learn the skills that had a strong killing power until he reached the small success stage. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui even attempted to add the Tiger’s Roar to the Bear Form or use the Tiger Form while in the state of the Bear Form. Unfortunately, wishes were beautiful, but reality was cruel. However, Qing shui believed he could successfully combine them in the future. </p>
 <p>This was so until Qing Shui was kicked out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>On the second day of New Year, the Skysword Sect became even colder than the day before. The snow started dropping again after it had fallen for half of yesterday. The dancing snowflakes were big and beautiful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Bear Form clumsily in the snow, but it was much better than when he began. Qing Shui secretly congratulated himself!</p>
 <p>“Hehe, mother, look at daddy! He looks like a black bear.”</p>
 <p>The crisp sound of laughing and talking mixed with Yiye Jiange’s unordinary laughter. Qing Shui looked at the two devastatingly beautiful goddess and loli helplessly. </p>
 <p>“Luan Luan, during this time, you need to learn this Black Bear Form.” Qing Shui laughed and lifted the little girl in his arms.</p>
 <p>“I won’t learn it! I won’t learn it! It’s so ugly!” Luan Luan’s head shook like a rattle-drum and yelled that she wouldn’t learn it! </p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not scared that she wouldn’t learn it. When the little girl would cultivate the Bear Form, she definitely wouldn’t know if it was the Bear Form. In addition, she couldn’t see whether or not she was a “little black bear.” Only the people next to her could see. </p>
 <p>“Ok ok, we won’t learn it! We won’t learn it!” Qing Shui kissed that beautiful apple-like cheek!</p>
 <p>Once Luan Luan heard that she didn’t need to learn it, she immediately became happy and nibbled on Qing Shui’s nose. Her giggle even made Yiye Jiange unable to suppress her laughter.</p>
 <p>“Master, if you don’t mind, would it be fine if you will learn something together with me?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said, a little embarrassed. </p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was also surprised. She then smiled and said, “Sure, you can’t keep any secrets to yourself!”</p>
 <p>“Why would I? For you, I would want to give twelve even if I only had ten.” Qing Shui chuckled. </p>
 <p>When Yiye Jiange heard Qing Shui’s words, her light smile didn’t change, but she felt a little sweetness in her heart. Qing Shui’s caring thoughts for her were like the drizzling rain, digging into her heart soundlessly. </p>
