 <p><strong>Chapter 102 Huoyun Liu-Li’s Gold Flint Iron Cauldron.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0102 – Huoyun Liu-Li’s Gold Flint Iron Cauldron </strong></p>
  <p><span style>She was a quiet woman. Her graceful figure and expression made Qing Shui feel a little dazzled and stunned. She was a pure but flirty and stunning woman. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Although his time in Hundred Miles City was short, Qing Shui had met many women. The one woman who was better than this one would only be Wenren Wu-Shuang. Compared to Shi Qingzhuang and Yu He, the three of them were like plum blossoms, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemums–they were all beautiful in different ways. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I want a concoction cauldron!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You, come over here.” The woman glanced at Qing Shui oddly. She looked at him quickly and was surprised, then she politely smiled and turned around to walk towards the warehouse on the north side. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was flabbergasted because the room that she led him to was different from the room that the middle-aged, simple-looking uncle led him to. However, Qing Shui didn’t bother to say anything, and took the time to boldly look at the woman’s exquisite and graceful figure. </span></p>
  <p><span style>This time, they did not enter any room in the north side, but instead took a corridor from the north and exited the hall. They entered the courtyard at the interior. The courtyard wasn’t wide; it wasn’t even as big as the hall, with rooms everywhere. The woman led Qing Shui and opened the door of a shabby wing on the west side. </span></p>
  <p><span style>When he entered, Qing Shui saw that this was an abandoned warehouse with a slight smell of mold on the inside. There were cobwebs everywhere, and there were many abandoned objected sprawled on the floor. The warehouse was extremely ragged, and there was a thick layer of dust on everything. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui frowned. Why did she take me here? “Does she intend to have an affair with me? But this place is too run down!” Qing Shui starting thinking dirty thoughts, but they were only thoughts. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and watched the woman use an iron sword get rid of the cobwebs. Her swaying body was still beautiful. She was graceful, and her expression was natural even when she was doing something like getting rid of cobwebs. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman nimbly got rid of the spider webs without getting a fleck of dust on herself, and then walked towards a pile of junk to dig up a pitch black… concoction cauldron!</span></p>
  <p><span style>She then walked out and handed it to Qing Shui. “Although the appearance of this concoction cauldron is not much, it is a lot better than the ones sold outside. It’s been here collecting dust for a long time. I feel that we have an affinity with each other, so I will give it to you as a present. I hope you can become an alchemist soon!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui took this pitch-black and unremarkable concoction cauldron; the moment he touched it, he felt warmth on his hands. “Hmm? Could this be made of </span><span style>Gold Flint Iron</span><span style>?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although Qing Shui could not be sure, he was pretty close. Qing Shui saw a record of Gold Flint in </span><i><span style>Treasure Notes</span></i><span style>. In ancient times, things that were used to make fire were called flint. There were different kinds like Gold Flint, or Wood Flint. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Gold Flint was used to make fire from the sun, and Gold Flint iron was extremely precious. Not only was it scarce, but it was also very versatile. One of the ways its power could be seen the best, was by using Gold Flint iron to make concoction cauldron. The rate of a successful refining process is doubled, and it wouldn’t explode. Gold Flint Iron Cauldron was listed on the concoction cauldron ranking in the continents, which showed just how precious it was. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you know the material of this concoction cauldron?” Qing Shui looked at the woman, and decided that her action was definitely intentional, so he did not want to act confused. After all, she could just sell another one of the cauldron that the middle-aged man sold him last time. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Looks like you have good taste. The best sword is only bestowed upon a hero. This is the Gold Flint Iron Cauldron that alchemists yearn for in their dreams.” The woman’s beautiful eyes flashed a moving brilliance. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I don’t want it. It’s too precious. We have only met twice up until now, and we don’t even know each other’s’ names. This is a priceless good. If you wanted to give it away, you should give it to an alchemist that is above Xiantian. It would be much more appropriate than giving it to an apprentice like me.” Qing Shui handed the Gold Flint Iron Cauldron back to the woman. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I didn’t see that you are such a sincere man, which makes my decision even more correct. Just pretend my cauldron to be an investment. Don’t forget me when you become a mighty alchemist in the future.” The woman chuckled, and led the way out of this abandoned warehouse. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui walked out, holding the cauldron with a forced smile. It was bogus to say that he did not want the cauldron. Just the double success rate was enough to make many alchemists crazy for it, but positive pellets refined in the cauldron will also have enhanced quality.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Could it be that you have dirty thoughts about me?” Qing Shui pondered and asked the woman. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Pfft, you are a little small!” The woman rolled her eyes charmingly. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I’m not small. Definitely not small. I’m not small anywhere!” Qing Shui straightened his body.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The woman blushed and looked at Qing Shui’s delicate, ageless, and charming face. His eyes were especially beautiful; they were profound, but clear. He was a little taller than her, and his slender figure had a refined air compared to other beastly muscular men. He was better in that his tall and straight figure gave off a gentle and natural feeling. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t be such a rascal! You can’t treat me rudely.” The woman scolded Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you really giving it to me as a present?” Qing Shui asked the woman when they arrived at the doorstep of Firecloud Blacksmith Store. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“This is called an investment. Don’t forget me when you become a mighty alchemist in the future!” The woman said with a light laugh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My name is Qing Shui. What’s your name?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, Huoyun Liu-Li!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui left with the Gold Flint Iron Cauldron. He couldn’t believe Yunhuo Liu-Li’s vision to be so sharp. Could she really see that he could be an alchemist in the future? </span></p>
  <p><span style>“She likes me? This is bullshit!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is it affinity?” Qing Shui felt that this was the only explanation. Everything that did not have an explanation could be explained with fate or affinity.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, another week passed. Qing Shui lived each day with a regular schedule. Maybe it was because of the Gold Flint Iron Cauldron, not only was the amount of Golden Sore Ointment concocted doubled, but the purity was also enhanced. The white powder had a little golden shine to it. </span></p>
  <p><span style>This was not the main improvement for Qing Shui right now. The thing that made Qing Shui the happiest was that the experience he earned grew two fold ever since he started using the Gold Flint Iron Cauldron. Before, he could only accumulate a hundred and eighty experience points a week, but now, he could accumulate around four hundred. Qing Shui felt happy when he looked at his almost six hundred experience points. If he kept going like this, he would be able to concoct the Small Revitalizing Pellet in a week. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt very emotional!</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, when he thought about how he still hadn’t heard any news from Wenren Wu-Shuang, Qing Shui immediately felt anxiety in his heart. It had already been two weeks. There was only a week left. If she did not come back this week, or did not find an antidote, the poison would take over her!</span></p>
