 <p><strong>AST 1343 - Shui Clan, Imperial Cuisine Hall's Status</strong></p>
 <p>When Qing Shui found Soulsearch, the latter had actually not gone to look at Li Ji. Earlier, Soulsearch had only used that as an excuse to leave Qing Shui to have a chat with Yuan Su. Seeing Qing Shui, Soulsearch smiled and said, "Brother, you're really blessed with good fortune in love."</p>
 <p>"Alright, Elder Brother, I need to discuss something with you. Can you teach your pulse taking technique to her?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Of course. Brother, right now, your mastery of it is much stronger than mine. As long as you wish for it, you can teach it to anyone," Soulsearch quickly said. It wasn't as if his great technique had a rule of not passing it to females or any other restrictions like that.</p>
 <p>"Come, let us go in. In the future, the Imperial Cuisine Hall has one more new addition." Qing Shui smiled and indicated for Soulsearch to enter with him. Li Ji was no longer there and was resting quietly in that small manor. After all, this place was too lively.</p>
 <p>When Yuan Su saw Qing Shui and Soulsearch walking in, she quickly stood up.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, she is Yuan Su, a friend of mine from the past. You should be clear of her medical skills and things like that. If you're agreeable, she'll be officially a member of our Imperial Cuisine Hall."</p>
 <p>"Welcome. Of course I have no objections. I'm more than happy," Soulsearch said happily.</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Miraculous Physician Soulsearch!" Yuan Su smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Don't go about calling me Miraculous Physician, it's jarring to the ears. Right now, you're also a member of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Moreover, you're friends with Brother. If you don't mind, you can call me Elder Brother as well," Soulsearch waved his hand and said.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother!" Yuan Su didn't stand on ceremony.</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright, come, let's all take a seat. It's a happy day today. With Lass Yuan joining in, the Imperial Cuisine Hall's abilities has increased quite a bit."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next day, Li Ji came as well. Her figure was now more rounded but if one didn't pay close attention, one wouldn't be able to tell that she was pregnant. When she saw Yuan Su, she was very happy. The two ladies appeared to get along very well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also started to teach her the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique, as well as a few sets of medical techniques which he had taught Soulsearch. However, Qing Shui got her to place her focus on medicinal herbs. Acupuncture was only a supportive measure.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su had an inborn talent in the area of medicinal herbs. As long as she could assess the illness, she could even create her own alchemy recipes. However, the only downside was that she was slow. Therefore, Qing Shui got her to pick up some acupuncture techniques. If there were any problems, she could just apply some simple acupuncture and there would be no need to write any alchemy recipes.</p>
 <p>There was free medical consultation today.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Qing Shui had said that all three of them would have to take part in the providing of free medical consultation. However, it wasn't just the three of them. Yao Qubing, the guy from Yao Clan, was also around as well. Yao Qubing was actually quite happy that Qing Shui had also brought him along for it.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, although Qing Shui had gotten him to deal with miscellaneous work, he was often given opportunities to provide medical treatment. He realized that he had learned a lot and now knew of Qing Shui's kind intentions. Qing Shui was trying to train him. After having gone through this period of time, he also realized how arrogant he was before.</p>
 <p>In terms of medical skills, the two here both surpassed him. Even the beautiful lady who had just joined was also stronger than him. He had always felt that amongst the younger generation, there was no one who could surpass him in terms of medical skills. But now, he realized how ignorant he was and he felt very embarrassed about it.</p>
 <p>Right now, he felt that his life was more fulfilling. In Yao Clan, he was a son born by a concubine and thus wasn't highly regarded. Although that young man called Qing Shui was very young, he wasn't a simple character. One day, Qing Shui would definitely soar up. Therefore, Yao Qubing felt that it would be quite good if he himself could become a physician in the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>After having thought through this, Yao Qubing's mind was more calm and he passionately did the work he was supposed to do. He had undergone a tremendous change compared to how he was when he first came.</p>
 <p>For this free medical consultation, Qing Shui continued to observe Yuan Su as he provided consultation. Regardless the patient, Yuan Su would wear a faint smile and appeared to be very skilled. Although she still didn't know how to use the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique, she was skilled in looking.</p>
 <p>Chinese medicine emphasized on look, smell, question and to feel. Yuan Su could be said to have brought the 'look' and 'question' aspects to a great level of mastery, being able to have a rough estimation of the ailment just by looking. She would then be mostly clear after asking the patients about their reactions and condition.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would occasionally nod his head. As long as she could tell what the ailment was, this lady would be able to prescribe the proper prescription. This was why Qing Shui had wanted her to learn the Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling technique. As long as she could learn that, she would basically be considered a top notch physician.</p>
 <p>Of course, when compared with Qing Shui who had the Force of Rebirth, miraculous acupuncture skills, Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and the Life and Death Needles, she was still a far cry. The ancient legacy had made Qing Shui to be as if he was given some kind of cheat skills.</p>
 <p>"Make way, our Young Master is dying."</p>
 <p>"Scram off, what are you looking at..."</p>
 <p>"How dare you guys dare to hit others in this place owned by the Miraculous Physician?"</p>
 <p>"If you don't make way, I'll kill you. If anything were to happen to our Young Master, all of you will have to die together with him."</p>
 <p>A commotion broke out. Qing Shui felt very puzzled. In the Yehuang City, his Imperial Cuisine Hall was connected even to the Yehuang Clan. By rights, no one would dare to be so rude and brazen here, let alone to raise their hands and fight.</p>
 <p>There were guards in the Imperial Cuisine Hall and a few of them immediately went up and said, "Making a racket is forbidden here. Arrest everyone who has started a commotion."</p>
 <p>"Damn it! How dare you arrest us. If you were to cause our Young Master's illness to deteriorate, I'll make sure your entire family joins him in death!" That arrogant voice sounded extremely agitated.</p>
 <p>A few people behind them were carrying a man who was covered in a blanket. The man was convulsing and spewing white foam. The blanket was filled with blood traces.</p>
 <p>"Brother, that's Shui Clan's youngest Young Master. He probably got into trouble at the brothel."</p>
 <p>"Is Shui Clan very powerful?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>However, before he got a reply, the few arrogant people had already beaten up a number of people and had left the man who was wrapped up in blanked on Qing Shui's table.</p>
 <p>"Quickly treat our Young Master, If his condition were to be delayed, you won't be able to answer."</p>
 <p>It was only then that Qing Shui took a clear look at this man. Right now, the young man's head was covered in sweat and his face was flushed red. He didn't seem to be middle-age and his countenance was pale, his eyes slightly red. His lips were thin and his nose slightly bent upward. This was a person who gave the feeling that he was an unfeeling person.</p>
 <p>"Why would I have to answer? My place doesn't provide treatment to everybody. Moreover, our Imperial Cuisine Hall isn't a place for you to be throwing your weight about."</p>
 <p>With that, with a wave of his hand, the over ten people, together with the man wrapped up in a blanket, were sent flying out. They spewed blood in midair and when they landed, they couldn't get up for a while.</p>
 <p>"Great! They deserved to be hit! This is the air of a Miraculous Physician, to treat one and all the same."</p>
 <p>"These idiots don't even try to see what place this is. To think that they dare to throw their weight about in the Imperial Cuisine Hall."</p>
 <p>"They are from Shui Clan, a clan who it is said to won't lose out to the Yehuang Clan. It is said that there's another person in the Shui Clan who had attained False God level."</p>
 <p>"It's no wonder that this Shui Clan's Young Master is so arrogant."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Miraculous Physician, we beg of you, please save our Young Master. Please save him. Otherwise, all of us will have to die."</p>
 <p>The person who was the most arrogant suddenly crawled toward Qing Shui, shouting out loudly.</p>
 <p>"Stop begging him. Don't you know that the Miraculous Physician doesn't save people like that? Quickly bring him away. Otherwise, there'll really be no more chance to save him," an old man sighed and said.</p>
 <p>"Quick, bring him away to some other place. If you're any later, it'll be too late."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The group of people lifted that unconscious man with great effort and left.</p>
 <p>The people who were injured were given priority in receiving treatment. Very soon, the place resumed to its earlier peaceful scene.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui wouldn't be afraid of anyone. False Gods wouldn't come out just for a small issue like this, let alone for a profligate son like him. Therefore, Qing Shui wasn't afraid. Even Peak Martial Emperors wouldn't be free to deal with these issues. They would be busy striving to attain a breakthrough from the Martial Emperor realm.</p>
 <p>Even if Peak Martial Emperors came, they wouldn't be able to do anything to Qing Shui. Moreover, in a situation like this, no one would want to offend Qing Shui, On the contrary, many people would be willing to help Qing Shui. It would mean a lot for Qing Shui to owe them a favor. Right now, everyone knew that Qing Shui could extend one's lifespan and as long as the person still had his last breath, he would be able to more or less extent a bit of their lifespan.</p>
 <p>It might be that the few subordinates of Shui Clan didn't know how powerful Qing Shui was. They had been with Shui Clan for many years and had always felt that Shui Clan was the most powerful. Even Yehuang Clan might not be more powerful than Shui Clan. Therefore, they could do whatever they wished in the Yehuang City, only paying attention to a few powers.</p>
 <p>This interruption wouldn't bring Qing Shui any kind of effect.</p>
 <p>The day of providing free consultation passed by very quickly and Qing Shui was very satisfied with Yuan Su's performance. However, another thing was that there was a need to enhance the guards. For example, to get them to be able to deal with slightly stronger existences.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch was also a State Master level cultivator. Don't look down on physicians. They could provide themselves with the fastest cultivation speed. Although Yuan Su was only at Peak Martial Saint level, her abilities would be improving at a rapid rate.</p>
 <p>The free medical consultation was over. After seeing what had happened today, Qing Shui felt that there was a need to beef-up their abilities, at least so that they could take care and protect themselves. With the Yang Pills, their abilities could improve tremendously. There were also the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet.</p>
 <p>Since he had decided on it, Qing Shui got right down to taking action. Although he wouldn't be leaving in the short term, there was no harm for him if they were to get stronger. Soulsearch was just like a blood brother to him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could sense this. When making friends, what was important was the sentiments.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch was knowledgeable, having experienced a lot of things in life. Yuan Su also had great knowledge which she had gained through books and other stuff. Therefore, both of them were especially shocked when they knew that Qing Shui had Yang Pills and they were One-Yang Pills to Three-Yang Pills at that. They were also surprised that these could be taken twice.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su looked at Qing Shui. It was a pity that she couldn't take it now and had to leave it for the future. However, it should be fast. Earlier, after having taken medicinal pills and Qing Shui had applied acupuncture on her, she had already attained a breakthrough. Moreover, her breakthrough had directly brought her to a height which she would never have dared to even think about in the past.</p>
 <p>She was also a Martial Emperor cultivator right now. However, Elementary Martial Emperors were still very weak. She would still need to take some more time if she wished to use the Yang Pills.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was astonished. So many years had passed and she didn't know that Qing Shui had already reached such a level. However, she knew that there would be no way that she would be able to catch up to him. It might not be a bad decision for her to stay next to him. After having run away for so many years, was she going to end up returning in the end?</p>
 <p>Why did she still have to fuss about all this? Even she herself didn't know what she was struggling for. Could it be that she was still unable to let it go? Many years ago, he had left very coolly, with a little anger. However, she had been feeling down about it for a very long time.</p>
 <p>When they met again today, he was still very cool and she was still feeling down as before.</p>
