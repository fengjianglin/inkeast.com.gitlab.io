 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This could also be considered a fortune. She had encountered the Dragonwolf Old Ancestor by chance while roaming the Giant Beast Mountain Range at the west of the Greencloud Continent. This was a major reason as to why she could become the Great Palace Master now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that the Dragonwolf Ancestor didn’t have long to live and was on his deathbed. This was also the reason why he had granted Qing Hanye his inheritance, which made her so powerful now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragonwolf Ancestor had only granted a portion of his strength to Qing Hanye. But even so, right now Qing Hanye’s strength was immeasurably deep. Sadly, the Dragonwolf Ancestor had passed away ten years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now there were two factions in the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. Qing Hanye as the Great Palace Master was one faction, while the other faction was headed by the Second Palace Master. When the Dragonwolf Ancestor was alive, nobody dared to entertain any such thoughts or say anything, as Qing Hanye’s strength was overwhelming. But after ten years, it was inevitable to have such conflicts, as a mountain cannot have two tigers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there were more people supporting the Second Palace Master. After all, Qing Hanye was just a woman who was also an outsider. Although she had obtained the inheritance of the Dragonwolf Ancestor, they still found it hard to approve of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Second Palace Master is truly a character. If I wasn’t a woman, most probably he wouldn’t have waited ten years to do this. But now, he can finally endure it no longer. Sadly, he doesn’t know that he has just wasted the best opportunity.” Qing Hanye stood beside Qing Shui. Both of them stood side by side, glancing at the foot of the mountain not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I believe this. It’s only expected that a normal man would do this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye turned and glanced at Qing Shui. From the start, other than some agitation on her face, she looked extremely calm; as calm as water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emotions between males and females were too complex. She was fond of Qing Shui, but she had experienced much, too much in these thirty years. The death of her grandfather and many other things caused her state of heart to be no longer as pure as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humans would always grow up; there would be times when they grew more mature. She didn’t know that she had grown up, or that her love for him had faded as time passed. When she didn’t see him, she would long for him. But when he was right in front of her eyes, her state of heart was calm instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are just like back then, truly a demon.” Qing Hanye retracted her gaze and spoke lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could also sense the transformations in this woman. That sort of fluctuation in the inner heart was extremely obvious. He wasn’t disappointed but felt somewhat relaxed instead. He smiled, “I climbed up here step by step.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye seemed as though she wanted to smile. At that very instant, extreme charm radiated out from her for just a moment. Even Qing Shui couldn’t help but to be slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye and him felt like they were strangers now. But then again, it was only to be expected. She didn’t really have much interaction with Qing Shui and the separation had already lasted tens of years. It was only natural that the two of them became strangers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was so, she still felt a sense of familiarity to him, an extreme familiarity. Earlier, she also thought of that dream that happened between them, but as her personality was always filled with charm, there wasn’t too much change to her expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That dream was sufficient to make her collapse and she would never forget it, ever. She always had him in her mind for so many years, waiting for his news but sadly, she had never manage to find any traces of him. After all, she had already left the Greencloud Continent after that, while this place was the North Ocean Region of the Haohan Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She couldn’t ignore him, but she felt like she no longer knew him. There was a point of her that hadn’t changed. She still trusted this man. This man wouldn’t have any designs on her and even if he had, she wouldn’t mind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder what you plan to do regarding this problem of the Dragonwolf Palace.” Qing Hanye changed topic and spoke of the problem today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t feel strange. He then questioned her, “What do you mean what I plan to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You represent the Sunset Sea King Palace while I represent the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. Regardless of the conflict between me and the Second Palace Master, on the surface, both of our Palaces are at war. Tell me, what should I do?” Qing Hanye spoke in a relaxed manner. Somehow, after encountering Qing Shui again, she felt pretty relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There isn’t any conflict between us, unless you want us to fight each other.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you mean there’s no conflict? The Dragonwolf Palace might obstruct the advance of the Sunset Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nope, it’s fine. No one can block them. The world is so vast and it isn’t easy to get acquainted with someone. Tell me, do you think we need to fight it out here? It’s unknown how large the north ocean is. We should turn our gaze further.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye’s expression remained calm. She could see Qing Shui’s point as well. She then sighed lightly, “How good would it be if you were someone from my Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. If that were the case, I wouldn’t be afraid even if the heavens collapsed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui started a little, because he couldn’t understand those words. They sounded like a declaration of love, and although she had once told him that she was fond of him, that was many, many years ago. Right now, Qing Shui couldn’t be sure if she still had feelings for him. He felt that time could change everything. Thirty years of time wasn’t a short period.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know what to say. He knew that since Qing Hanye could arrange a meeting with him, she should be very clear of his circumstances. She should also know that Yiye Jiange was his wife, among others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although I’m not someone from the Dragonwolf Palace, we are still friends. That is, unless you are unwilling to acknowledge me, someone from your past.” Qing Shui smiled. He didn’t need to act as though they were still very close. There was simply no need for that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui knew that Qing Hanye was the Great Palace Master, he felt very relaxed in his heart. Also, he heard that there was some conflict between her and the Second Palace Master and he smelled an opportunity. If the Sunset Palace could form an alliance with the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace, they would be able to invade the Northern Ocean Region quicker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t treat you as a friend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s countenance had no fluctuation when he heard her words. Qing Hanye then slowly continued, “In my heart, you are always my kin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stared at her bright eyes. It was very rare for him to see such pure eyes filled with innocence. There were no complex emotions in them at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then just treat me like your elder brother. How do you plan to deal with the Second Palace Master?” Qing Shui solemnly nodded his head as he stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are still like this. I’m sure I’m older than you. Anyway, there will definitely be a death match between me and the Second Palace Master.” Qing Hanye smiled at Qing Shui as her countenance grew relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will aid you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t need to interfere in this. I can do it with my strength. If it were ten years ago, I might not be confident but now, he isn’t my opponent. After I gain control of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace, why don’t you come over here and be my protector?” Qing Hanye laughed.</span></p>
