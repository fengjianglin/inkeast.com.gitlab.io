 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The few ladies, as well as Lan Lingfeng and the others, found Qing Shui's decision hard to believe. However, no one stopped him. They believed in Qing Shui and that no matter what he does, it would be the right thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked over to the Second Young Master Hua without any signs of wariness. However, only Qing Shui was aware that he had already circulated his powers and that other people won't be able to sense it. This was Qing Shui's ability, having a free universe in his body where everything flowed orderly. His passive martial techniques and abilities were circulating every single moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second Young Master Hua still felt a little hesitant and uncertain. Although he wasn't afraid to die, it would be easy for Qing Shui to kill him while giving him treatment. He didn't wish to die in this manner. Moreover, he also hoped to be able to kill Qing Shui while Qing Shui was providing him with treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although these thoughts ran through his mind, he still hesitated. He was afraid if Qing Shui really were to be able to help him but he had killed Qing Shui, then it would mean that he had destroyed himself completely once again. Although Qing Shui had crippled him before, he had also made him understand a lot of things. Those who could endure pain could end up standing at the top. He was considered to have put through great pain now. If he were to be treated this time around, he would have benefited greatly despite all the pain he had been put through over the years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Put out your hand." Qing Shui walked up to Second Young Master Hua and said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Master!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An elderly man behind Second Young Master Hua called out. He had lived a long life and had experienced all sorts of things in life. He felt that this wasn't a good idea. Everyone knew that it was very easy for a physician or an alchemist to kill, let alone when the physician or alchemist was an enemy. Therefore, the old man quickly tried to stop the Second Young Master Hua.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I understand, 5th Master. It's fine." Second Young Master Hua shook his head and stopped the old man from saying anything more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man opened his mouth and didn't say anything. He took a step back but still remained very close to Second Young Master Hua, where he would be able to take action at the very first moment. He looked at Qing Shui warily, at this young man whom he couldn't see through. Qing Shui seemed to be very gentle and warm, he was not looking like a crook at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the eyes of crooks, there were also good and bad people. The bad people in the eyes of crooks were considered crooks as well. They knew that they were crooks themselves, but many of them couldn't take things lying down when they saw other people doing bad deeds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the old man didn't see himself as a crook. Second Young Master Hua wouldn't see himself as a crook either. He would only think that he was unbridled or young. It was easy for him to find an excuse for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man didn't think that Qing Shui was like a crook either. It wasn't like one could see at the first glance if a person was good or bad. However, everyone had their intuitions and would be able to make a judgment on one's speech, actions, habitual actions, and most importantly, one's gaze. People tended to have their own intuitions, regardless if they were accurate or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This intuition was very scary and many people would be able to sense something from the very start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second Young Master Hua was also making a bet. Although he hated Qing Shui and wouldn't think of his enemy as a good person, he had some kind of intuition that this person could be trusted. This was also why he could accept Qing Shui's suggestion of providing him with treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't completely a case where he would attempt anything when rendered in a desperate situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second Young Master Hua slowly reached out his hand. This arm was fair and tender, but it belonged to a man despite looking like that of a woman. However, Qing Shui's sexual preference was normal and therefore didn't think anything of it. He reached out his hand to check Second Young Master Hua's pulse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't thought of harming him in this manner. There wasn't a need for him to do that and he didn't care about doing this either. He merely felt that there was a knot in his heart. It was a strange feeling. It was like breaking through a realm. He felt that he should be able to benefit from this and he might even be able to resolve this knot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was only an assumption and he wasn't sure if he could really do it. It was a new attempt. In the past, he wouldn't do this. Enemies could only be enemies. Resolving feuds tended to be something very boring. After all, restoring a broken relationship was just a legend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, since Qing Shui had already done what he did, he wouldn't think about turning back. Since he had already crippled Second Young Master Hua back then, he had never thought of having any more interactions with Second Young Master Hua and the Hua Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, many years had passed and their paths crossed again after such a long time. Qing Shui was now attempting a new approach. This approach might allow him to jump out from his own regulations in the past, breaking through a shackle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took Second Young Master Hua's pulse seriously and soon understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The martial technique which you cultivates is one that has a strong Yin Qi. Your body had once recovered, but it was now destroyed by such Yin Qi. I don't know how long your body had recovered or was it because the duration was short and you didn't realize." Qing Shui looked at Second Young Master Hua and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The latter shook his head, "I'm not sure. What I want to know now is if you can treat my condition."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can, but I'll need at least three months' time." Qing Shui shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of that Westgate Hegemon. He had no idea where that guy had been. He would eventually meet with the Foolish Sage Inheritor. His presence was a must. There was also the Sacred Fairy Inheritor Sheng Jun and the pair of Demon King Inheritors, &nbsp;Leng Feng and Ye Mei...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second Young Master Hua didn't seem the least surprised and he looked at Qing Shui as if wanting to understand some things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can let you recover your manhood in just one day. Everything will be perfectly normal. However, if you wish for it to be completely treated, it would need three months." After a long while, Qing Shui spoke up again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, the Second Young Master Hua was very astonished and there was an unconcealable surprise on his face. He still found it hard to believe and his expression was very complicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Under what condition will you treat me?" Second Young Master Hua fell silent for a while before saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, they were enemies. It was impossible for Qing Shui to provide him with treatment without a motive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I said it before. It'll be considered repayment for not laying your hands on my friends. However, since you've brought this up, can I raise a small request?" Qing Shui drew back his hand and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Go on." Second Young Master Hua looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know that you want a fight with me. How about this, I'll give you treatment in a while and then we'll have a fight. What do you think?" Qing Shui also sensed that the Second Young Master Hua was now very strong. However, he still shouldn't have a problem to defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second Young Master Hua was once again taken by surprise. He now felt that he couldn't understand Qing Shui at all. He had no idea what Qing Shui wanted to do. Earlier on, Qing Shui had said that he was going to treat his condition as he hadn't laid his hands on Qing Shui's friends. Of course, he wouldn't believe this. However, he couldn't find a better reason otherwise.</span></p>

Right now, there was an imbalance in the yin and yang energies in the Second Young Master Hua's body. If a man didn't possess True Yang energy, he would naturally lose his ability to live as a man. The theory was very simple. Strong physicians and alchemists would all be able to tell the cause of Second Young Master Hua's condition, but they wouldn't have the means to resolve it. Such an extreme imbalance of yin and yang was impossible to treat without some kind of divine arts.</span></p>
