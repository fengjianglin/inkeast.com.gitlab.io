 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui appeared to be in much better spirit that he was before. When he was covered in bloodstains earlier, even people who were close to him were shocked from the sight. Now that he had washed off the blood on him, he appeared to be a little pale, but was already not much different from an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui sat down, the table was already filled with wine and food. Yu Niang and the others were all around. Looking at the familiar people gave Qing Shui a feeling as if he was reborn. He had gone through this scene many times already, but he would still feel extremely overwhelmed each time. After all, life and death was all in a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Today is a happy day. Why is it that no one's looking happy today? Come, let's have a drink to celebrate." Qing Shui knew that everyone was worried about his injuries. He knew that he was fine now and he picked up his wine cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone picked up their cups. Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng were fine. After all, they were men and were more hardy. Xue Nuo's injuries were now fine too. After everyone picked up their cups and had a drink, the atmosphere loosened up a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, you're injured, so you should drink less." Yu Niang said softly to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, elder sister. This wine doesn't hurt the body. Instead, it's even good for injuries." The wine that Qing Shui was drinking was the wine from his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It really wouldn't bring any harm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Niang didn't stay for long before she took her leave first. After all, she still had to take care of her children. The others didn't say much either. Yu Niang was the oldest amongst them here, the mother of four children, and Qing Shui's elder sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, do you think that the Niu Clan will really come to help us fix the Imperial Cuisine Hall?" Lan Lingfeng gave it some thought before asking Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It actually doesn't matter if they come or not. But we must let them come fix this Imperial Cuisine Hall." Qing Shui smiled and said. The Niu Clan's Old Ancestor has died and now the Niu Clan was nothing for them to fear. They probably won't be staying here for too long as the Imperial Cuisine Hall was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was seated next to Qing Shui and didn't say a word all this time. Qing Shui looked at her, "Sister Qing, why have you come? This is such a coincidence."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You'd have been able to resolve the matter no matter if I was here or not. I was only here to take a look and hadn't expected to encounter this." Qin Qing said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you here to look for me?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng smiled and looked at Ziche Sha, who also smiled and looked back. Right now, the two of them were in a very good relationship. Seeing how Qing Shui and Qin Qing were, they actually hoped that the two of them could get together in the end. This was what friends were. Friends would hope that each of their lives would only get better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing smiled and nodded, "I'm just here to take a look."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother-in-law, you didn't even go and visit Sister Qing after such a long time, making her have to come to look for you." Xue Nuo intercepted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head. It was nothing for this lass to usually call him like this. Although it was a fact, when it was brought up before Qin Qing, he didn't know what she'd feel on hearing this address. Would she feel more resistance toward him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Didn't I just return? I had been in the Ice Ocean Domain all the while previously and just came back today..." Qing Shui replied helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother-in-law, is the Ice Ocean Domain fun? Tell us how it's like there. Right, is my elder sister going to stay at the Ice Ocean Domain?" Xue Nuo asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The competition is still intense in the Ice Ocean Domain. It's the same everywhere, but it's more dangerous in the water. It's safer on land." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It'd be good if I can have a look under the water one day."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You'll have the chance to." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just then, there seemed to be some commotion outside. Not long later, Tianyi walked in and said to Qing Shui. "The Niu Clan is fixing the Imperial Cuisine Hall."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are there any direct descendants of the Niu Clan?" Qing Shui smiled, asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes, but they don't know how and are only watching from the sides as the workers are fixing up the damage." When Tianyi spoke to Qing Shui, he was very respectful. Qing Shui was the person who had given him a new life and was also a great expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that the Niu Clan wouldn't be able to fix up the mess if they were to do it themselves. Although they were strong, this was the work for craftsmen. For some of their direct descendants to be able to show up, it meant that what Qing Shui said came true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since then, there was no need for Qing Shui to head out to take a look. The Niu Clan would leave the place and he had no intention to wipe them out entirely. One must leave others a way out, but he wasn't sure if it should be done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Qing Shui didn't do anything was because there were many Demon Lord Inheritors. The Niu Clan was destined to never be able to catch up to him. Therefore, he didn't wish to chase them to their wits end, forcing a backlash. There wouldn't be any benefits from doing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Child Niu and Lei Ming wouldn't be able to catch up to him. Today, he had dealt them a blow, and it would be very hard for them to attain further breakthroughs. As time passed, they would be tossed very far behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the sun had already set and this meal was considered dinner. After the meal, the others left. It had been a tiring day today, one of mental fatigue. Therefore, everyone wanted to return to have a rest. They also wanted to leave time for Qing Shui to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, they were both considered husband and wife. Qing Shui looked at Yin Tong and Ling Fei, Lan Lingfeng and Ziche Sha... Yin Tong was more a devoted person, while Lan Lingfeng had a great infatuation. Therefore, these two men were basically going to have only one wife. Qing Shui was a little envious. Having only one husband to one wife was good. Both parties would ony have each other in their hearts, with nothing else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Nuo had also left. She also felt tired. Qin Qing stood up and said slowly, "You must be tired, you should have an early rest!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head. "I'm not tired. I'm very happy. Are you tired? If you aren't, let's take a walk together."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't give Qin Qing a chance to choose and took the lead to take two steps forward. Qin Qing shook her head helplessly and followed Qing Shui out of the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the streets that appeared familiar yet not so to him. Qing Shui hadn't walked along the streets a lot and during this period of time, the place had not changed much. The street was still filled with people. The world wouldn't change just because someone was gone. Everyone would be busy in their own circles. Take today's events for example. Although a huge commotion was created, there were very few people who knew about what had happened. Ordinary people wouldn't care. They only wanted to make their lives slightly better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a little emotional. It could be because he had just gone through a life and death battle, and felt that everything in this world seemed to be so wonderful. Many conflicting matters weren't really that conflicting. It was because in comparison, they were not worth mentioning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the meaning of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If I were to die, would you be sad?" Qing Shui asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why are you asking this?" Qin Qing looked at the surroundings. She was very quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was very beautiful, and there was no flaw to pick about her. Many people on the streets would turn to look at her. It was too normal. In Qing Shui's previous life, beautiful ladies would also have many people turn to look at them. It was a pity for the beautiful and the very beautiful ladies from his previous life if they were to compare to Qin Qing; their gap was far too great. There was nothing to compare. A large reason for this was this world's environment, spiritual Qi, and cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're cultivators and we live with our lives at risk everyday. Everytime I escape from the clutches of death, I would feel as if I had just been reborn. During times like this, I would feel very daring, as if I've seen through a lot more. Many troubling matters in the past wouldn't be as troubling anymore." Qing Shui smiled and said as he walked on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"For example?" Qin Qing gave it some thought and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"For example, I like you a lot, but you aren't willing to become mine. In the past, thinking about it would make me upset, and that I would really want to make you mine. However, right now I feel that liking someone doesn't necessarily meant that you'll have to own the person. Is this considered self-consolation?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was stunned for a moment before she nodded, her face heating up a little, "It should be self-consolation."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled, "Then will you console me? I won't have to do self-consolation then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing shook her head firmly, "I've already started to waver. Qing Shui, give me a little more time. I remember that I'd told you this before. Even if I don't marry you, I won't get married to anyone else."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sister Qing, you're a normal woman. Humans have emotions and desires. Don't you feel bad like this? If there's no means of release for your emotions, you may get into trouble easily." Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing's face turned red before she looked at the front and said, "I can still bear with it. If there's a day that I need a relationship, would you have one with me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course, my embrace will always be open for you. We're family. No matter what trouble you encounter, you must remember that there's me. don't stand on ceremony with me, otherwise, I'd feel very sad." Qing Shui reached out and plucked up the courage to take her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn't the first time that Qing Shui was holding her hand, but each time, his heart would palpitate. Qin Qing didn't resist, and even grabbed his hand tightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Women are often contradictory like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them held hands and strolled along the street like a couple, like an ordinary pair of man and woman in love. Qing Shui was very calm. He was a little agitated, but more calm. It was as if he was holding the hand of his woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How's things at home?" Qing Shui thought of the Great Qin Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Everything's fine. What are your plans?" Qin Qing looked at Qing Shui and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll stay here for a while and in the middle, I might need to go home to take a look. When I came, my youngest son was only a few months old. When I return this time, he should be able to call for his father." Qing Shui smiled and said, his eyes filled with happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had thought things through. It was good to make some things clear. He understood Qin Qing and knew that even if she wanted to know, she wouldn't ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The kid must look very good!" Qin Qing smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, he looks like his mother. In the future, if you have a child, the child would look very good as well." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing's heart beat a little faster, and the hand that was holding Qing Shui's tightened. However, she soon relaxed and looked at Qing Shui, smiling, "You're very evil. Stop bringing me into the picture."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at how she was pretending to be angry, Qing Shui smiled. "Alright, alright, I won't go on. What about you? What are your plans?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll temporarily stay at the Great Qin Dynasty and here. Do you welcome me?" Qin Qing replied very fast, as if she had already thought of this previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I couldn't ask for more. The Imperial Cuisine Hall is your home." Qing Shui knew that Qin Qing was doing this for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky had turned dark and the streets had lit up. The big trees along the street were hanging with bright light stones, causing the entire street to be, although not as bright as the day time, on par if not better than the street lamps in Qing Shui's previous life. This was the civilization of another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them reached home, the people from the Niu Clan had already gone back. The Imperial Cuisine Hall had been restored to its original appearance. There was no doubt that the craftsmen the Niu Clan had found were very good. Actually, not much of the Imperial Cuisine Hall had been destroyed and it was very easy to restore everything back to how it was.</span></p>
