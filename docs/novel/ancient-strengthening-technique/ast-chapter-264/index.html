 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>Chapter 264: She likes you, except she doesn’t realize it yet</strong></p>
  <p>Tears streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably, and her weak sobs were almost inaudible.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li already had the will to die the moment she took the death blow for Canghai Mingyue. Even after she was struck, she could still feel the sharp pain on her face. However, she didn’t care anymore because she knew she wouldn’t survive the hit. </p>
  <p>But, when she opened her eyes and saw Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue’s familiar faces, she was instantly engulfed in happiness. The feeling of being able to live again wasn’t something that could be experienced by many. When her hand felt the scary wound on her face, she knew that she was ugly in her current state even without the help of a mirror. It was to the extent that she couldn’t even use the word ‘ugly’ to describe it anymore… </p>
  <p>She was so proud of her facial features for all these years, but now that her looks were gone, she wished she never had them in the first place. The shock she received was worse than when a Xiantian Cultivators had their cultivation crippled.</p>
  <p>“It’s better this way. I can be alone forever from now on…” Huoyun Liu-Li secretly made plans for herself!</p>
  <p> After she made her decision, her mind was instantly filled with thoughts of Qing Shui’s smile and everything that had happened between them, from the first time she saw and met him at Earthly Paradise, to every delightful event that occurred after. The tears fell from her eyes, staining a large area of the the purple scarf underneath her.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue walked out of the living room. They understood that Huoyun Liu-Li was extremely heartbroken. She didn’t want her weak and delicate side to be exposed to others. In the end, they could only opt to leave her alone for a while so she could tend to her own wounds.</p>
  <p> “Qing Shui, what are we going to do about Liu-Li? She must be very upset right now.” Canghai Mingyue was also saddened by the fact. No one understands Huoyun Liu-Li more than she does. Deep inside, she knew Huoyun Liu-Li had not only lost her good looks but Qing Shui too.</p>
  <p>“You don’t need to worry about this. I’ll definitely find a way to restore her looks. Honestly, I’m more worried about what will happen to us tomorrow.” Qing Shui said in all seriousness.</p>
  <p>“True, there’s a bigger obstacle waiting for us!”</p>
  <p>Canghai’s voice came travelling from a distance!</p>
  <p> “Father!”</p>
  <p>“Senior!”</p>
  <p>Canghai and his wife both smiled gently at Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue. Qing Shui discovered no matter what Canghai faced, he would keep a calm demeanor. This was the basic bearing needed to succeed in life. </p>
  <p>Problems could not be solved if you’re blinded by hatred and anger. It would be difficult to come back from that and it never ends well.</p>
  <p> “Senior, other than the Old Blindee from Immortal Sword Sect, are there anymore especially strong cultivators?” Qing Shui was suddenly reminded of the middle-aged man in the purple robe. If more of these people existed in the Immortal Sword Sect, then his chance of survival would be extremely low. </p>
  <p> “The ancestor of the Immortal Sword Sect, Zhu Gejian is of Martial King Grade 4 and the next strongest Elder is of Martial King Grade 3!”</p>
  <p> In the Martial King realm, a difference in one grade is enough to pressure you to death and the differences in two grades cannot be won by numbers alone. Back then, Canghai’s grade was higher than Old Blindee’s, thus he could overpower the Great Sect. However, the Great Sect could have easily eliminated him if they had broken through…</p>
  <p> “Is there anyone in the Southern City who wants to destroy the Immortal Sword Sect?” Qing Shui asked Canghai.</p>
  <p> “There is, but with Old Blindee here, they wouldn’t even have the guts to do it!” Canghai laughed. He knew what Qing Shui meant but it’s useless to depend on others at this point. He felt bitter as he thought about the events that had happened before.</p>
  <p>“What if Old Blindee dies?” Qing Shui’s eyes were burning with passion. </p>
  <p>Canghai’s heart wavered, but in the end, he looked at Qing Shui and shook his head. “Nobody in Southern City is capable of killing him. ”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t reply, but his eyes gleamed with determination!</p>
  <p> “Qing Shui, remember you can count on me tomorrow. You need to listen to me at all costs.” Noticing the gleam in his eyes, Canghai hurriedly continued on. </p>
  <p>The sun shone brilliantly from the East, transforming the appearance of the land into a glistening golden state. Qing Shui realized that it was already noon and he hadn’t eaten yet. </p>
  <p>“Nevermind, cultivate! We can go home to have our meal together in the afternoon.” Qing Sui smacked his forehead as he walked towards the place where he usually did his morning training. </p>
  <p>Soaring Crane Steps!</p>
  <p>Right now, Qing Shui didn’t want to think about anything else except for speed. He wouldn’t mind exhausting all of his might in an instant if it meant his speed could be increased to the peak of his abilities.</p>
  <p>Circulating the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he kept practising the Soaring Crane Steps. Soaring Crane Steps deplete his might by a large amount, although it was said that three times the power consumed would be equal to a three times increment in speed. But Qing Shui realized that wasn’t the actual case as the larger the amount consumed, the speed would be higher than three times the consumption amount. </p>
  <p>There were advantages that came with a large power consumption. He would be able to ambush one of the Elders from the Immortal Sword Sect. During his last battle with Elder Ying, the distance between him and Elder Ying was too far so he couldn’t manage to perform a sneak attack on him. On top of it, Elder Ying was wielding a large blade, causing Qing Shui’s Soaring Crane Steps to be forced to retreat without any success. Most importantly to note is that he had already achieved the 90th cycle of circulated Qi.</p>
  <p>After he surpassed the 90th cycle of circulated Qi, his strength had increased tremendously. The fine training he did at the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal also helped to moved it up another notch.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui patiently cultivated at the empty plot of land, taking a break every once in awhile before he continued practising again. </p>
  <p>It was already past noon before Qing Shui stopped cultivating to take out the Soulshake bell and proceeded onto refining it in a slow manner. A long period of time had passed since it was raised to a higher grade, and since then nothing had changed.</p>
  <p>He refined it ten times straight without stopping, even entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal midway to release a portion of the refined energy!</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the Soulshake bell still didn’t get upgraded. He was frustrated because when tomorrow comes, he would be up against the Immortal Sword Sect, the foremost Great Sect in both the State and South City.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was worried that he wouldn’t be able to use the Soulshake bell to the best of his abilities when the time comes. He didn’t want it to end with him regretting his life. Qing Shui knew that the greatest use for the Soulshake bell was a defiance of the natural order in the world of the nine continents. </p>
  <p>It was a pity that the grade was too low!</p>
  <p>As he looked towards the sky, he walked in the direction of the pavilion Huoyun Liu-Li stayed in. When he entered her bedroom, he discovered that she was already awake, and greeted him with a light smile on her face.</p>
  <p>Grinning, Qing Shui sat by Huoyun Liu-Li’s bed side to grab her hand with his own!</p>
  <p> Huoyun Liu-Li moved away the instant she saw him reaching his hand out, but Qing Shui managed to capture both her hands in the end.</p>
  <p>Not speaking a word, he carefully circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to warm her meridians, bones and organs. </p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, I know you won’t believe whatever I say so I won’t say anything much. I just want to let you know that I’m still the same Qing Shui from before, and you’re still the Huoyun Liu-Li I know.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gently gazed at Huoyun Liu-Li as he said lthis ightly, reaching out his other hand to grasp Huoyun Liu-Li’s snowy jade white hand. </p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li’s eyes are were laced with happiness, warmth as well as loneliness and disappointment! </p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to say anything more, and was at a loss of what to do. Right now he couldn’t even crack a joke, let alone sexual ones. If he hadn’t tried to, it would make her imagination run wild with negative thoughts. But if he did, it would only make her feel worse. </p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, how are you feeling? I already looked at your wounds, it’s not a big deal anymore. Come, I’ll carry you out for a walk!” Qing Shui said as he directed his eyes at Huoyun Liu-Li who was looking bored on top of the mattress. </p>
  <p>“I can get up already?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked in surprise. </p>
  <p>“Yeah. Come, slowly!” Qing Shui grinned and then, he simply carried her in his arms! </p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, do you know when I saw you in that state, my heart felt like it was being torn to pieces. If anything had happened to you, I would never forgive myself.” Qing Shui said in a low tone, his voice hoarse. Although the change in the tone of his voice wasn’t obvious, it definitely sounded different than before.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, stop. I know. Sister Mingyue told me everything. You’re so silly, why are you treating yourself like this? If anything happens to you, I won’t even pass in peace.” Having said that, she hugged Qing Shui by the neck and burst into tears. </p>
  <p>“How dare she tell you about this, I’ll confront her later.” Qing Shui said angrily.</p>
  <p>“Don’t you dare!” Huoyun Liu-Li raised her tear-covered face. There was no trace of grace and charm left on her face right now but it didn’t look any different in Qing Shui’s eyes. She was still beautiful, just like how you would like someone even if they had flaws. </p>
  <p>“Alright alright, I won’t!” Qing Shui carried the thin clothed delicate body.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, Sister Mingyue likes you, except she doesn’t realize it yet. Please be nice to Sister Mingyue. I have never seen her treat another guy the same way she treats you.” Huoyun Liu-Li said as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, do you like me?” Instead of replying her, he questioned in a serious manner.</p>
  <p>After he asked that, he sensed Huoyun Liu-Li stilled in shock before smiling. She avoided Qing Shui’s gaze and shook her head. “I don’t like you. I don’t like you anymore.”</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, if I become crippled one day, will you be disgusted and hate me?” Qing Shui asked lightly.</p>
  <p>“No, never. I will still love you no matter what you become…”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li hurriedly said as she panicked. She noticed the smile in his pair of intoxicating eyes and fell silent.</p>
  <p>“It’s like what you said, Liu-Li, I like you. You’re always the beautiful and charming Liu-Li I know in my heart.”</p>
  <p>After he said that, Qing Shui leaned over to kiss those pale lips!</p>

But Qing Shui realized that wasn’t the actual case as the larger the amount consumed, the speed would be higher than three times the consumption amount. </p>
 <p>There were advantages that came with a large power consumption. He would be able to ambush one of the Elders from the Immortal Sword Sect. During his last battle with Elder Ying, the distance between him and Elder Ying was too far so he couldn’t manage to perform a sneak attack on him. On top of it, Elder Ying was wielding a large blade, causing Qing Shui’s Soaring Crane Steps to be forced to retreat without any success. Most importantly to note is that he had already achieved the 90th cycle of circulated Qi.</p>
 <p>After he surpassed the 90th cycle of circulated Qi, his strength had increased tremendously. The fine training he did at the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal also helped to moved it up another notch.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui patiently cultivated at the empty plot of land, taking a break every once in awhile before he continued practising again. </p>
 <p>It was already past noon before Qing Shui stopped cultivating to take out the Soulshake bell and proceeded onto refining it in a slow manner. A long period of time had passed since it was raised to a higher grade, and since then nothing had changed.</p>
 <p>He refined it ten times straight without stopping, even entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal midway to release a portion of the refined energy!</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the Soulshake bell still didn’t get upgraded. He was frustrated because when tomorrow comes, he would be up against the Immortal Sword Sect, the foremost Great Sect in both the State and South City.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was worried that he wouldn’t be able to use the Soulshake bell to the best of his abilities when the time comes. He didn’t want it to end with him regretting his life. Qing Shui knew that the greatest use for the Soulshake bell was a defiance of the natural order in the world of the nine continents. </p>
 <p>It was a pity that the grade was too low!</p>
 <p>As he looked towards the sky, he walked in the direction of the pavilion Huoyun Liu-Li stayed in. When he entered her bedroom, he discovered that she was already awake, and greeted him with a light smile on her face.</p>
 <p>Grinning, Qing Shui sat by Huoyun Liu-Li’s bed side to grab her hand with his own!</p>
 <p> Huoyun Liu-Li moved away the instant she saw him reaching his hand out, but Qing Shui managed to capture both her hands in the end.</p>
 <p>Not speaking a word, he carefully circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to warm her meridians, bones and organs. </p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, I know you won’t believe whatever I say so I won’t say anything much. I just want to let you know that I’m still the same Qing Shui from before, and you’re still the Huoyun Liu-Li I know.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently gazed at Huoyun Liu-Li as he said lthis ightly, reaching out his other hand to grasp Huoyun Liu-Li’s snowy jade white hand. </p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li’s eyes are were laced with happiness, warmth as well as loneliness and disappointment! </p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to say anything more, and was at a loss of what to do. Right now he couldn’t even crack a joke, let alone sexual ones. If he hadn’t tried to, it would make her imagination run wild with negative thoughts. But if he did, it would only make her feel worse. </p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, how are you feeling? I already looked at your wounds, it’s not a big deal anymore. Come, I’ll carry you out for a walk!” Qing Shui said as he directed his eyes at Huoyun Liu-Li who was looking bored on top of the mattress. </p>
 <p>“I can get up already?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked in surprise. </p>
 <p>“Yeah. Come, slowly!” Qing Shui grinned and then, he simply carried her in his arms! </p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, do you know when I saw you in that state, my heart felt like it was being torn to pieces. If anything had happened to you, I would never forgive myself.” Qing Shui said in a low tone, his voice hoarse. Although the change in the tone of his voice wasn’t obvious, it definitely sounded different than before.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, stop. I know. Sister Mingyue told me everything. You’re so silly, why are you treating yourself like this? If anything happens to you, I won’t even pass in peace.” Having said that, she hugged Qing Shui by the neck and burst into tears. </p>
 <p>“How dare she tell you about this, I’ll confront her later.” Qing Shui said angrily.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you dare!” Huoyun Liu-Li raised her tear-covered face. There was no trace of grace and charm left on her face right now but it didn’t look any different in Qing Shui’s eyes. She was still beautiful, just like how you would like someone even if they had flaws. </p>
 <p>“Alright alright, I won’t!” Qing Shui carried the thin clothed delicate body.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Sister Mingyue likes you, except she doesn’t realize it yet. Please be nice to Sister Mingyue. I have never seen her treat another guy the same way she treats you.” Huoyun Liu-Li said as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, do you like me?” Instead of replying her, he questioned in a serious manner.</p>
 <p>After he asked that, he sensed Huoyun Liu-Li stilled in shock before smiling. She avoided Qing Shui’s gaze and shook her head. “I don’t like you. I don’t like you anymore.”</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, if I become crippled one day, will you be disgusted and hate me?” Qing Shui asked lightly.</p>
 <p>“No, never. I will still love you no matter what you become…”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li hurriedly said as she panicked. She noticed the smile in his pair of intoxicating eyes and fell silent.</p>
 <p>“It’s like what you said, Liu-Li, I like you. You’re always the beautiful and charming Liu-Li I know in my heart.”</p>
 <p>After he said that, Qing Shui leaned over to kiss those pale lips!</p>
