 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2310 - Powerful Berserk Dragon Fist, Rebuilding the Chi Clan</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking back at their struggle until now, Chi Yang was in a daze. Right now, he had an urge to cry. He raised his head to look up into the sky, wanting to tell of the deceased members of the Chi Clan to take a look. The Chi Clan had returned!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, everyone in the Chi Clan was feeling very emotional. Everyone had their sense of belonging. A clan gave them exactly it. It was just like how things were for everyone in Qing Shui's previous life. No matter what kind of insignificant characters they were, they would have a sense of belonging to their own countries. It matched the saying that a country's prosperity is the responsibility of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked around before turning his attention onto the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique. There was now an additional Berserk Dragon Fist below the Dragon Form. It had been very long since he had last comprehended a new battle technique. He hadn't expected that this time around, with the use of the Windwhisk Willow, the Dragon Form's Berserk Dragon Fist was awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an awakening. It was a Dragon Form's battle technique. However, before this, it was just that he didn't meet the requirements to obtain it and thus hadn't comprehended it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked toward the Berserk Dragon Fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Berserk Dragon Fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon race's powerful physical fist technique for attacking. The most basic requirement for learning this fist technique was to have a powerful body. It was because the Berserk Dragon Fist's prowess was tremendous. If the body wasn't powerful enough, one would get injured when trying to attack the other party. Without a powerful body, one wouldn't be able to unleash the Berserk Dragon Fist's prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second thing was strength. Strength wasn't the most important thing, but the stronger the strength, the better. However, there must be a relative relationship with one's defense. One's strength mustn't surpass one’s own defense. Otherwise, it would be very easy for one to become injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another thing was speed. Speed was power. When two attacks were of the same level of power, speed was a very important factor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui finally understood the importance of the Windwhisk Willow. It was because without the Windwhisk Willow, he would probably be unable to comprehend this Berserk Dragon Fist anytime soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui continued to read on and felt especially happy. There wasn't a concrete strength indicator for the Berserk Dragon Fist. He only knew that speed decided the Berserk Dragon Fist's prowess. As long as one's body defense could withstand it, then the prowess for the Berserk Dragon Fist could become increasingly terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than that, the Berserk Dragon Fist itself had a unique ability—Damage Increase. If the damage you had was 5, when it hit the target, the damage could be 8 or higher. This was the Berserk Dragon Fist's unique trait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Berserk Dragon Fist used one's defense as the foundation. Each punch brought forth every bit of one's terrifying drive, and the strength of the attack would be determined by the speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Berserk Dragon Fist. Qing Shui felt that this was a fist technique that was tailor-made for him. This made sense. This technique was part of the legacy that belonged to him, and it wasn't strange for it to be tailor-made for him. After all, the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique was an existence that belonged to his own soul's imprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Legacies were good things. It was because the Berserk Dragon Fist seemed as if it was imprinted into his soul and there wasn't a need for him to study too hard into it. Thus, there wasn't much room for improvement nor any unfamiliarity. It would be as if he had practiced it for several ten thousands of times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui gave it some thought. If he were to strengthen his body's toughness and then tried hard to raise the level of his Windwhisk Willow to increase his speed, the prowess of the Berserk Dragon Fist would become increasingly strong. By then, one might be able to become like a humanoid Berserk Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui yearned for that power as well. After all, which man wouldn't like to have overwhelming strength and power? All this while, he had focused more on control skills. His output abilities would only be considered mediocre. Right now, with the Stellar Transposition and the Flying Sword, he was able to make up for the difference. However, both of these didn't have that much relation to himself. Moreover, the Stellar Transposition could only be used once every five minutes while the Flying Sword primarily focused on sharpness and speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The addition of Berserk Dragon Fist felt very exhilarating for Qing Shui. He finally had a fist technique which would allow him to engage in close combat with others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui regained his senses and noticed that the others were bandaging their wounds, taking care of their comrades' corpses, or drinking water. He walked toward Chi Yang and his wife. The two ladies were nearby as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle was over and many people were in dire straits. However, the two ladies still looked clean and untainted. It didn't appear as if they had just experienced a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The prowess that Shen Huang had displayed during the battle earlier astonished many people. She had received the Divine Flower Inheritance and thus no one had been able to get close to her during the battle. Moreover, she had an adolescent Rainbow Divine Dragon next to her. As for whether the others knew it was a Rainbow Divine Dragon, it was of little importance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, let's go to the Chi Clan. I wonder if the previous Chi Clan is still around." Qing Shui looked around and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several decades had passed, and they had no idea if the building was still around. If it was, then who did it belong to now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmm. I really don't know how to thank you." Chi Yang pat Qing Shui's shoulder and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't know what to make of our relationship previously. Chi Ao and Chi Feng are my foster children, so even if taking them into consideration, we'll be considered brothers. If we're brothers, then don't stand on ceremony. Be more carefree," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I were you, I would be carefree too. I hadn't been helped by someone else like this. To be helped when I'm in so much despair that I almost can't get back on my feet... That feeling isn't something that can allow you to be as carefree as you want." Chi Yang said bitterly with a little smile on his face,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I understand. But now that everything is resolved, you can be carefree at last. Just treat me as your best friend or brother." Of course Qing Shui understood this. If one was indebted to someone else, it would be hard to feel carefree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The previous Chi Clan’s manor was still around. It was a huge and rustic building. When Chi Yang stood before the place and looked at the rustic gates, he teared uncontrollably. He wasn't the only one. Many people also couldn't hold back their tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been close to forty years. They hadn't expected that they would be able to return to this place one day, back to the Chi Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang looked at the door of the gate. He walked over slowly and pushed open the heavy door. Back then, many people had died here. It could be due to this reason that no one lived in this great manor. Of course, only those few forces could afford to live in such a great manor, but they had their own manor anyway. If you were to let them stay in the Chi Clan's manor, they wouldn't feel at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang pushed open the doors, walked in, and a desolate scene was presented before his eyes. Wild grass grew everywhere and a lot of them was taller than that of a person. However, there would occasionally be rats or other things running past. The pond in the courtyard had already dried up, only dried up grasses could be seen inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone took out some weapons and started cleaning up the place. There was strength in numbers. With there being over 100 of them, all of them being powerful warriors, it was a breeze to clean up the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under ordinary circumstances, they wouldn't have to do such chores. However, things were different now and doing these chores seemed to be a kind of things for them to enjoy. After all the weeding and cleaning up, the place was taken care of very quickly. Some people started to fill up the pond with water, and many people started to clean up the interior of the manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui and the two ladies didn't help out. Qing Shui held the two ladies' hands and looked around, starting to set up formations. This place might become a battlefield. Qing Shui thought of that Divine Rain Sect. Moreover, the Demonic Elephant Sect, the Divine Buddha Sect, and the Wu Clan were still existing. The She Clan was the only group which was considered to have landed in a similar plight as the Chi Clan back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did they clean up, but there were also people who purchased a lot of flowers and grass to plant in the garden. Some things which needed to be replaced were also replaced. After all, the fighting back then had damaged quite a number of things.</span></p>
