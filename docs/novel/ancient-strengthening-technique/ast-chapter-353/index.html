 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 353 Qing Shui's Plan, Be Harsher, Be More Vicious</strong></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui walked over and squatted next to her. He patted her, "It's impossible to resurrect the dead. Your sister would not want you to be sad like this either."</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui, I'm just so wracked with grief. I don't know what I should do."</span></p>
  <p><span>As she said that, Wenren Wu-shuang looked up at Qing Shui with her red eyes, a sense of undescribable fatigue reflected in her expression. She seemed extremely helpless at this moment.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui could understand what she was feeling. He gave her a light hug!</span></p>
  <p><span>"You still have me. We won't let your sister die for nothing. She's looking at you from the heavens, hoping that you'll be happy and live your life. She has already left, you can't let her not be in peace."</span></p>
  <p><span>Wenren Wu-shuang looked at Qing Shui seriously and said, "I want to make Situ Clan disappear!"</span></p>
  <p><span>"I'll help you do that. There's no more reason for Situ Clan to survive. I should have done this back then. The reason everything turned out like this today was all because I was too soft-hearted previously."</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui was very regretful. If he knew that this day would come, even if there were two Situ Clans, he would still eradicate them. Qing Shui had never cared about eradicating down to the roots. But now, he understood that there were times when this was an absolute necessity.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Bring them away and scram!" Qing Shui said as he looked at Situ Clan's people. It did not matter if he did not kill these small fries now, so he might as well get them to bring the few corpses back.</span></p>
  <p><span>The few of them delightfully brought back the corpses which were in a horrible state. They had all been frightened out of their wits when they saw Wenren Wu-shuang's bloody means. Hearing that they did not have to die made them feel overjoyed.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, if they were clever enough, they would not return to Situ Clan but escape out of Hundred Miles City directly. It was because even if they were to return, what that would await them would still be death.</span></p>
  <p><span>But no matter what, everyone was overjoyed now, with the exception of Wenren Wu-shuang who was extremely down crested. Having lost her closest and only kin, no one would feel good in her shoes.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Wu-shuang, don't feel sad. This will be your home in the future, and everyone here will be your kin. Your enemies will be eradicated."</span></p>
  <p><span>The few men had not only brought the three corpse away, but even cleaned up the place as well, at an amazing speed. It might have been because they were afraid that Qing Shui and the others would change their minds.</span></p>
  <p><span>After a while, Qing Yi looked to the others and said, "Let's head in and make plans on what we should do from now on. Wu-shuang, just stay here with us in the future. We've plenty of rooms and it'll be more lively with more people around."</span></p>
  <p><span>Ever since Qing Shui appeared, Mingyue Gelou's gaze had been fixed on him, her gaze brimming with delight. When Qing Shui held Wenren Wu-shuang's hand and passed by her, his other hand reached out to pick up her tender hands.</span></p>
  <p><span>Looking at Qing Shui's slight smile, Mingyue Gelou smiled, feeling contented!</span></p>
  <p><span>"Brother Qing Shui, sisters-in-law..."</span></p>
  <p><span>When they walked past Qing You, his burning gaze looked towards Qing Shui. Qing You's life was saved by Wenren Wu-shuang, and he also knew that these two ladies of unparalleled beauty had an inseparable relationship with Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Let's head back in first and have a talk. Having not met for so long, we should have a lot to talk about." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qing You, reaching out his hand to pat on the shoulders of the man who had a much bigger build than himself, before he picked up Mingyue Gelou's hand once again, and headed in.</span></p>
  <p><span>Although no one said a word, and not even after they all entered the living room, everyone's gaze was on Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span>While they did not say anything, everyone was guessing what Qing Shui's level of cultivation was. To be able to defeat a cultivator who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian in one move, what level did it require...</span></p>
  <p><span>"Martial King?"</span></p>
  <p><span>This term felt so far away, but now that they had one in their clan, many people in Qing Clan were in great disbelief.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Brother Shui!"</span></p>
  <p><span>"Daddy!"</span></p>
  <p><span>"Brother Qing Shui!"</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui saw that it was Qing Bei, Little Yuchang, and Qing Hu!</span></p>
  <p><span>"Aunt is too bad! How could you knock us out?!" Qing Bei said angrily, but it only caused a series of well-intentioned laughters.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Carry! Daddy carry!"</span></p>
  <p><span>Little Yuchang did not grew far apart from Qing Shui just because they were separated for three years. This made Qing Shui especially astonished. She was only two years old when he left, and now she was already five. While she was in a daze for a short moment at the start, very soon, she ran towards Qing Shui happily.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui did not expect that he now had two "daughters". He quickly carried the little lass, smiling as he looked at Qing Bei and Qing Hu.</span></p>
  <p><span>"You've grown so big now. Did Little Bei miss Brother Shui?"</span></p>
  <p><span>In three years, Qing Bei had already grown into a fine lady, much more mature than the young lass she was when he left.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Of course I did. I missed you a lot. Brother Shui, what is your level of cultivation now? To think that you were able to defeat someone who's at the pinnacle of Xiantian." Qing Bei asked the question which everyone had wanted to ask but did not do so.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui gave it some thought before he replied with a smile, "I'm not very sure, but I should be able to defeat some practitioners who are at the Martial King level."</span></p>
  <p><span>"Defeat Martial King?" Qing Bei asked, astonished. Even the others who were mentally prepared were all shocked. Martial King. To them, that was a legendary existence.</span></p>
  <p><span>There was not even a single Martial King across the whole Cang Lang Country, let alone in Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui in a daze, looked at this son of hers who had made everyone envious. He had once said that within five years, he would bring her to Yan Clan. There were only two years left.</span></p>
  <p><span>He used the past three years to achieve a level others might never be able to achieve in all their lives. For the past three years, what was the price he had paid? What had this son of hers been doing? What had he experienced? What tough training had he gone through....</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Yi thought a lot, feeling varying emotions of misery, delight, and even more of pride. He was her son!</span></p>
  <p><span>"Daddy, where have you been? You weren't here play with me at all!" Little Yuchang asked seriously. Kids' emotions were very strange. Qing Shui did not expect this lass to be able to remember so much at such a young age.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Daddy has things to do. Once I'm done with them, I'll return and play with Yuchang, alright?" Qing Shui said as he rubbed his face against the lass's tender cheeks and smiling.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Mmm mmm, daddy must make good of your words!"</span></p>
  <p><span>"Of course, how would I bear to lie to our precious?"</span></p>
  <p><span>The biggest unique trait of little children was their naivety, but Qing Shui did not intend to lie this time around. It was because he had decided to stay in Hundred Miles City for a while, at least two years.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui briefly shared what he had been through for the past few years, but of course, what should be concealed was left unspoken. Just like that fling with Elder Yun from Feng Clan.</span></p>
  <p><span>A short while after Qing Shui had finished sharing, Qing Yi asked calmly, “How long will you be staying this time around?"</span></p>
  <p><span>However, Qing Shui could still sense a hint of anticipation!</span></p>
  <p><span>"This time around, I should be staying for a year, or at most two. Then I'll head to Yan Clan with mother." Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi, determined and confident.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui, I have changed my mind. We won't go to Yan Clan. Mother just wishes that you'll be safe..." Qing Yi said, misery in her eyes. Why burden the next generation with her own troubles? It was tough enough for Qing Shui as it was.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui of course knew what his mother was thinking. She did not wish to put him through all these hardships. She wanted to head to Yan Clan much more than anyone else, but she was just worried for him.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Doesn't mother wish to meet Qingqing? Don't you wish for her to return to you? Don't you wish for her to call you mother?" Qing Shui recalled that silhouette he saw back in Yan City. It was one which was going through much hardship. But now, he could not let his mother know that she was suffering yet.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui did not want his mother to be worried. He buried it all in his heart. He had already toiled through so many years, that another one plus years would be nothing much. When he stabilized his 5th Heavenly Layer, he would basically have great confidence to head to Yan Clan. Since he would be going, he must stomp down on them! No matter what the reason was or what difficulties Yan Clan had!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Yi was silent. Her flesh and blood which she had carried for ten months. All these years, there was not a day when she did not miss her. Most people would not be able to understand how tormenting it was for her, knowing where her child was but yet unable to meet her, and she did not even know if her child was doing well...</span></p>
  <p><span>"Mother, don't think about it anymore. If it's fast, it'll be after next year's new year, if not, the slowest would only be the end of next year. We'll go bring back Qingqing then, alright?" Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi's contested expression, and said softly.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Yi nodded, smiling as she looked at Qing Shui!</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui, then what should we do now?" Qing Yi asked her son, who had become the most important member in the clan. At this moment, she was still feeling very happy. To be able to see her son achieving great success, and now, in the blink of an eye, her son had also resolved the biggest crisis for Qing Clan.</span></p>
  <p><span>"First is to wipe out Situ Clan. I'd wanted to leave them a way out previously, but now, there's no need for that anymore. Treating them with kindness is to be cruel to ourselves. If I was harsher back then, more vicious back then, then things wouldn't become what it is now."</span></p>
  <p><span>"I'll go with Brother Qing Shui!" Qing You said loudly.</span></p>
  <p><span>It was an opportunity for Qing You. It was not something bad to have gone through the gates of hell. He did not just receive a fright. In that instant where one's life and death was unknown, he would be able to more or less comprehend some things.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui grinned, stood up and said, "Wu-shuang and I will be the only ones to go to Situ Clan. You guys just stay here, it'll be over very soon!"</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui..."</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui..."</span></p>
  <p><span>...</span></p>
  <p><span>"Don't worry! With me around, nothing will happen!" His strong confidence erased all doubts the others had.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Wu-shuang, let's go. We'll head to Situ Clan, and make them take up the responsibility for their foolish actions!"</span></p>
  <p><span>Situ Clan!</span></p>
  <p><span>Situ Nantian and Situ Ba looked at the three corpses before them, astonished. They could not believe that what they were seeing was the truth.</span></p>
  <p><span>He could still tell who two of the corpses belonged to. One was his grandson, Situ Shang, while the other one is a grade 8 Xiantian cultivator Yan Xu. While he could not tell from the last one's appearance, he could sense who it was.</span></p>
  <p><span>Li Long!</span></p>
  <p><span>Li Long, who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian!</span></p>
  <p><span>To think that a cultivator who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian died just like that...</span></p>
  <p><span>Now, Situ Nantian and Situ Ba no longer felt anything about Situ Shang's death. It was because they now wanted to find out who had did this, and they also could tell how serious the problem was.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Who did this? Who did this?" Situ Nantian looked at the few men kneeling before him, bellowing in fury.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui, it's that Qing Clan's Qing Shui. He did this. One move, he defeated Mister Li Long in one move!" A man who could not keep in his fear blurted out.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui? That demon from Qing Clan is back? To think that he could defeat someone who is at the pinnacle of Xiantian in one move..."</span></p>

 <p><span>After a while, Qing Yi looked to the others and said, "Let's head in and make plans on what we should do from now on. Wu-shuang, just stay here with us in the future. We've plenty of rooms and it'll be more lively with more people around."</span></p>
 <p><span>Ever since Qing Shui appeared, Mingyue Gelou's gaze had been fixed on him, her gaze brimming with delight. When Qing Shui held Wenren Wu-shuang's hand and passed by her, his other hand reached out to pick up her tender hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at Qing Shui's slight smile, Mingyue Gelou smiled, feeling contented!</span></p>
 <p><span>"Brother Qing Shui, sisters-in-law..."</span></p>
 <p><span>When they walked past Qing You, his burning gaze looked towards Qing Shui. Qing You's life was saved by Wenren Wu-shuang, and he also knew that these two ladies of unparalleled beauty had an inseparable relationship with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let's head back in first and have a talk. Having not met for so long, we should have a lot to talk about." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qing You, reaching out his hand to pat on the shoulders of the man who had a much bigger build than himself, before he picked up Mingyue Gelou's hand once again, and headed in.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although no one said a word, and not even after they all entered the living room, everyone's gaze was on Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span>While they did not say anything, everyone was guessing what Qing Shui's level of cultivation was. To be able to defeat a cultivator who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian in one move, what level did it require...</span></p>
 <p><span>"Martial King?"</span></p>
 <p><span>This term felt so far away, but now that they had one in their clan, many people in Qing Clan were in great disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Brother Shui!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Daddy!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Brother Qing Shui!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui saw that it was Qing Bei, Little Yuchang, and Qing Hu!</span></p>
 <p><span>"Aunt is too bad! How could you knock us out?!" Qing Bei said angrily, but it only caused a series of well-intentioned laughters.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Carry! Daddy carry!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Little Yuchang did not grew far apart from Qing Shui just because they were separated for three years. This made Qing Shui especially astonished. She was only two years old when he left, and now she was already five. While she was in a daze for a short moment at the start, very soon, she ran towards Qing Shui happily.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui did not expect that he now had two "daughters". He quickly carried the little lass, smiling as he looked at Qing Bei and Qing Hu.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You've grown so big now. Did Little Bei miss Brother Shui?"</span></p>
 <p><span>In three years, Qing Bei had already grown into a fine lady, much more mature than the young lass she was when he left.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course I did. I missed you a lot. Brother Shui, what is your level of cultivation now? To think that you were able to defeat someone who's at the pinnacle of Xiantian." Qing Bei asked the question which everyone had wanted to ask but did not do so.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui gave it some thought before he replied with a smile, "I'm not very sure, but I should be able to defeat some practitioners who are at the Martial King level."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Defeat Martial King?" Qing Bei asked, astonished. Even the others who were mentally prepared were all shocked. Martial King. To them, that was a legendary existence.</span></p>
 <p><span>There was not even a single Martial King across the whole Cang Lang Country, let alone in Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui in a daze, looked at this son of hers who had made everyone envious. He had once said that within five years, he would bring her to Yan Clan. There were only two years left.</span></p>
 <p><span>He used the past three years to achieve a level others might never be able to achieve in all their lives. For the past three years, what was the price he had paid? What had this son of hers been doing? What had he experienced? What tough training had he gone through....</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Yi thought a lot, feeling varying emotions of misery, delight, and even more of pride. He was her son!</span></p>
 <p><span>"Daddy, where have you been? You weren't here play with me at all!" Little Yuchang asked seriously. Kids' emotions were very strange. Qing Shui did not expect this lass to be able to remember so much at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Daddy has things to do. Once I'm done with them, I'll return and play with Yuchang, alright?" Qing Shui said as he rubbed his face against the lass's tender cheeks and smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Mmm mmm, daddy must make good of your words!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course, how would I bear to lie to our precious?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The biggest unique trait of little children was their naivety, but Qing Shui did not intend to lie this time around. It was because he had decided to stay in Hundred Miles City for a while, at least two years.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui briefly shared what he had been through for the past few years, but of course, what should be concealed was left unspoken. Just like that fling with Elder Yun from Feng Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span>A short while after Qing Shui had finished sharing, Qing Yi asked calmly, “How long will you be staying this time around?"</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Qing Shui could still sense a hint of anticipation!</span></p>
 <p><span>"This time around, I should be staying for a year, or at most two. Then I'll head to Yan Clan with mother." Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi, determined and confident.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui, I have changed my mind. We won't go to Yan Clan. Mother just wishes that you'll be safe..." Qing Yi said, misery in her eyes. Why burden the next generation with her own troubles? It was tough enough for Qing Shui as it was.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui of course knew what his mother was thinking. She did not wish to put him through all these hardships. She wanted to head to Yan Clan much more than anyone else, but she was just worried for him.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Doesn't mother wish to meet Qingqing? Don't you wish for her to return to you? Don't you wish for her to call you mother?" Qing Shui recalled that silhouette he saw back in Yan City. It was one which was going through much hardship. But now, he could not let his mother know that she was suffering yet.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui did not want his mother to be worried. He buried it all in his heart. He had already toiled through so many years, that another one plus years would be nothing much. When he stabilized his 5th Heavenly Layer, he would basically have great confidence to head to Yan Clan. Since he would be going, he must stomp down on them! No matter what the reason was or what difficulties Yan Clan had!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Yi was silent. Her flesh and blood which she had carried for ten months. All these years, there was not a day when she did not miss her. Most people would not be able to understand how tormenting it was for her, knowing where her child was but yet unable to meet her, and she did not even know if her child was doing well...</span></p>
 <p><span>"Mother, don't think about it anymore. If it's fast, it'll be after next year's new year, if not, the slowest would only be the end of next year. We'll go bring back Qingqing then, alright?" Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi's contested expression, and said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Yi nodded, smiling as she looked at Qing Shui!</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui, then what should we do now?" Qing Yi asked her son, who had become the most important member in the clan. At this moment, she was still feeling very happy. To be able to see her son achieving great success, and now, in the blink of an eye, her son had also resolved the biggest crisis for Qing Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span>"First is to wipe out Situ Clan. I'd wanted to leave them a way out previously, but now, there's no need for that anymore. Treating them with kindness is to be cruel to ourselves. If I was harsher back then, more vicious back then, then things wouldn't become what it is now."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'll go with Brother Qing Shui!" Qing You said loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was an opportunity for Qing You. It was not something bad to have gone through the gates of hell. He did not just receive a fright. In that instant where one's life and death was unknown, he would be able to more or less comprehend some things.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui grinned, stood up and said, "Wu-shuang and I will be the only ones to go to Situ Clan. You guys just stay here, it'll be over very soon!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui..."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui..."</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>"Don't worry! With me around, nothing will happen!" His strong confidence erased all doubts the others had.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Wu-shuang, let's go. We'll head to Situ Clan, and make them take up the responsibility for their foolish actions!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ Clan!</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ Nantian and Situ Ba looked at the three corpses before them, astonished. They could not believe that what they were seeing was the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span>He could still tell who two of the corpses belonged to. One was his grandson, Situ Shang, while the other one is a grade 8 Xiantian cultivator Yan Xu. While he could not tell from the last one's appearance, he could sense who it was.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Long!</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Long, who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian!</span></p>
 <p><span>To think that a cultivator who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian died just like that...</span></p>
 <p><span>Now, Situ Nantian and Situ Ba no longer felt anything about Situ Shang's death. It was because they now wanted to find out who had did this, and they also could tell how serious the problem was.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Who did this? Who did this?" Situ Nantian looked at the few men kneeling before him, bellowing in fury.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui, it's that Qing Clan's Qing Shui. He did this. One move, he defeated Mister Li Long in one move!" A man who could not keep in his fear blurted out.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui? That demon from Qing Clan is back? To think that he could defeat someone who is at the pinnacle of Xiantian in one move..."</span></p>
