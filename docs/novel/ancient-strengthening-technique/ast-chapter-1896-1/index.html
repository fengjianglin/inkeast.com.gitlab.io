 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grand State Master said with a smile when he saw the expression on Qing Shui’s face. However, his smile was extremely cold. At the same time, his aura was heightened to its peak, as if he would make his move once more should Qing Shui decided not to hand over those items to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t even expect that the Grand State Master would actually develop such a thought in his head. Indeed, he had some decent items with him, but nothing that the other party could use. Unfortunately. Even if Qing Shui did not have the Paragon Strike, the Grand State Master wouldn’t be able to do anything to him, much less intimidate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have some items with me. But I don’t know if you have the capability to take them away from me.” Qing Shui said as his grip on his Golden Battle Halberd tightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, then I will let you try again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he was done talking, a circle of black demonic Qi rose up from his body and enveloped his surrounding, it was preventing anyone else from seeing him clearly. The attack the Grand State Master had inflicted on Qing Shui contained poison, but Qing Shui was unharmed from the attack. Because of that, the Grand State Master was able to tell that Qing Shui had a powerful artifact that could prevent him from getting poisoned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thousand Poisonous Centipede Hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were dark red stains on the Grand State Master’s blue palm as well. However, after taking a closer look, there were also hints of grey and white in between those colors. Moreover, there was a faint green glow emanating from his palm too. As time went by, various colors began to show up as the unpleasant stench of rotting flesh grew stronger, inducing an urge to vomit almost instantly. This type of stench could be detected even without sniffing through the nose as the smell was able to enter through the pores of a human body. Thus, it would be useless to hold one’s breath to avoid getting a whiff of the unpleasant stench.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui was able to see the Grand State Master once more, he realized that there were numerous arms flailing about in his surroundings. They were like flexible snakes while making a light hissing sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui dared not to be careless despite being able to avoid being poisoned. He could be said as a man who would not be affected by a hundred types of poison. Even so, he would not be able to avoid all poison with absolute precision. As long as his opponent’s poison could restraint him or that the toxicity was strong enough, he would still end up getting poisoned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sensed his opponent’s aura for a moment and could clearly tell that the Grand State Master’s aura was more staggering than his own power. Because of that, Qing Shui decided not to hide anymore. As he was about to make his move, the woman suddenly stood in front of him and intervened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t make a move on him!” The woman looked at the Grand State Master with determined eyes. Her aura had risen to its peak as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, alright. Do you want to fight me then?” The Grand State Master was preparing to make a move at first, but when he saw that she was about to fight him, he quickly stopped instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you make a move against him, I will stop you too.” The woman said, straightforwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have never forced you to do anything before. In my heart, you are the purest woman in the world. Why did you hook up with this kid so quickly? Have both of you move on to the stage of sleeping together?” Even though the Grand State Master was smiling, anyone could tell that he was actually furious inside based on his aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why does it concern you whoever I hook up with?” The woman shot a displeased look at the Grand State Master. Her eyes were filled with animosity and disgust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression on the Grand State Master’s face became even more gloomy upon seeing her disgust. His eyes became slightly red as he exerted his focus on the woman, “I changed my mind. Initially, I wanted to make you my woman through your own willingness. But now, even if I have to snatch you away, I will definitely make you mine today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really think you can have your way with me? Even if you succeed, you will only get a dead person in the end.” The woman said, coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you know that in many situations, death isn’t actually the most terrifying thing in this world? Even if you die, I will reanimate your body and you will still belong to me. We will spend every night together.” Grand State Master said as he stared at the woman with a ruthless expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman grew slightly pale this time. This was truly more terrifying than death itself. However, there was actually one way to avoid being reanimated, and that was to die with her body smashed into pieces. Even so, there would be times where she wouldn’t be able to control how she would die. She was afraid that the outcome would be different than she had intended. If she ended up dead one day, her death would be considered a luxury anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For someone like you, who’s not even a human nor a ghost, to have such dirty, evil thoughts at this age, you only know how to scare a little girl. What else can you do?” At that moment, Qing Shui began to make a disdainful taunt at the Grand State Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kid, I will let you know what it means to beg for death in just a little while. They are your women, right? Heh heh…..” The Grand State Master turned his attention to the ladies behind Qing Shui after he said that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand State Master was quite surprised to know that this kid actually had so many beautiful women by his side. Each of them was as beautiful as Dongfang State Master herself. He even had a hard time ranking their beauty in order too. If men kept holding on to their desires, they would always treat women as their priority, which was much better than having money in their opinion. This concept would apply to his past life as well. One would be able to get women once they become rich. Money was the only condition of having women. Women were regarded as the ultimate goal, at least after one had become wealthy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was indifferent at first, but when he heard those words coming out from his mouth, his expression grew deep and cold, “You will definitely die today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha!” Grand State Master burst into laughter when he saw Qing Shui becoming furious. It also seemed as if he had heard the best joke ever in his entire life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman, on the other hand, was gazing at Qing Shui with a strange look. Her expression was quite exuberant too. Previously, when Qing Shui said that the Grand State Master had frightened a little girl, wouldn’t that mean that he had regarded her as a little girl…..&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, Dongfang girl, I say we team up and exterminate him. What do you think?” Qing Shui said as he turned to look at the absent-minded woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman rubbed her forehead with her pale arms and gave a firm stare at Qing Shui as she asked, “Can we beat him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t try, you’ll never know. Heh heh, I can guarantee that he will at least lose some layer of skin if not dead. However, he will certainly die. I know how to use poison too.” Qing Shui smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn’t used poison in a very long time as he always felt that poison could never be utilized in the open fight. Poisons were considered dark due to its ability to poison himself if overused. Not only that, it could corrupt his heart too, which was why he would never use poison unless it was absolutely necessary. However, Qing Shui could care less about not using poison now that he had met this poison expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite Qing Shui not using poison for a long period of time, he had been researching on poison regularly. Moreover, whenever he encountered things that contained poison, he would collect and keep them together. The poison beings in his poisonous lake in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had accumulated to an incredible amount. Besides, due to the survival of the fittest, those without sufficient toxins would never survive. Those that survived, however, were definitely beings of extreme venom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would occasionally cultivate these venoms before mixing them whenever he had free time. Moreover, the small lake had the Triple-eyed Grass Green Frog and other crystals now, which would allow the venom to multiply in toxicity. After that, he could quench and refine the poison, thus compressing its toxicity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This one’s for you. This is an item of poison too. If you can make a cut on his body, he will find himself in a serious situation. You can use this to block against his attacks by utilizing its deflecting ability to dodge or whatever.” Qing Shui said as he handed her the Poison Dragon Dagger.</span></p>

He had also forged about ten daggers from those one section of the extremely tough bones. The remaining parts of the bones, however, were left to soak under the poison lake instead.</span></p>

One word difference in those words had caused a major distinction in grades [1]. Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd was a Divine Artifact, but its current capability and aura could only be considered to be of a high-level False God grade. A true Divine Artifact was as if it had a soul infused in it, especially those of the high-level Divine Artifacts.</span></p>
