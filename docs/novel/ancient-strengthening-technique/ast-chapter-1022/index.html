 <p><strong>AST 1022 - Holy Bracelet, Working Together Silently, Buddha Swordplay</strong></p>
 <p>This day, Mo Hongluo stayed at the Qing Clan. Having not met for so many years, they had a lot to talk about but Qing Shui had his own plans. The Buddha Sect at the Central Continent was divided into nine sect or nine gates and the Buddha Sword Sect was one of it.</p>
 <p>At the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, he had previously stayed at the Golden Buddha Temple. There, he had a flash of realization, being able to improve his strength. Being at the Golden Buddha Temple, he knew the basic situation of the Buddha Sect.</p>
 <p>The Abbot at the Golden Buddha Temple told him about some things regarding the Buddha Sect. Of course, it was just some minor problems, such as the Buddha Sect and Nine Sect not being very united, but were unanimous about external things.</p>
 <p>Buddha Sword Sect!</p>
 <p>This was the Sect in which Huoyun Peng was. The Master was someone of the Huoyun Sect and Huoyun Peng was the fifth son of the Master. Qing Shui was not sure about other things aside from that and so he would have to head to the Demon Gate once again.</p>
 <p>After cultivating for a night, Qing Shui, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mo Hongluo and Qing Yu rushed to Demon Gate on the second day.</p>
 <p>While on the way, Mo Hongluo carried Qing Yu, a few little items and some toys and snacks to bribe the naughty girl. Many people of the Qing Clan had received gifts from Mo Hongluo. Everyone had one, but the one Qing Yi received was the most expensive.</p>
 <p>Golden Silk Cicada Wings Dress were something precious. Even if Qing Shui could find it, the item was not easily available. Yet Huoyun Liu-Li actually received a Golden SIlk Cicada Wings Dress. It was clear that the quality given to Huoyun Liu-Li was good.</p>
 <p>It is not that Mo Hongluo did not love his daughter. It was a type of appreciation. Liu-Li has what she has today because of Qing Shui. Mo Hongluo knew everything now and Qing Yi was Qing Shui’s Mother.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi wanted to give it to Huoyun Liu-Li, but how would Huoyun Liu-Li accept it. She pulled Qing Yi to the room to change into it. She had already seen Qing Yi as her mother long ago and had given everything to Qing Shui. A man that she loved deeply, loved everything about him including those close to him. Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, and the others were like sisters to her. She had been in the Qing Clan for many years already and felt this it was a warm and comforting place.</p>
 <p>“Grandmother, you are really beautiful. As beautiful as Mother.” Qing Yu chuckled, letting out a sharp and clear laughter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed. This girl could really “flatter” someone. Perhaps it was not considered as flattering. As long as she saw a good looking woman, the girl would not forget to compliment them. She knew that when she complimented them, she would be able to get a benefit.</p>
 <p>“You sneaky girl, come tell Grandmother how am I pretty.” Mo Hongluo liked the little girl.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, they had reached the Demon Gate. This time, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant flew above Demon Gate. Many people from Demon Gate were shocked and envious after seeing the huge and powerful Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Even some Elders of the Elder Association from Demon Gate would be shocked. That was because some of them felt that the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was very scary. Some could even tell the level of strength that the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had. If the mounts of this youth people was already that strong, exactly how strong could that youth be?</p>
 <p>An ordinary mount usually would not be stronger than their Master. It was not impossible, but it was very rare.</p>
 <p>A few elders from Demon Gate were caught up in pondering. They had a little over five thousand stars strength and were the strongest of the Elder Association from Demon Gate. However, a few of them realized that even with a few of them combining their strengths, they could not bring down such a strong Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>The reason why he flew over was that Mo Hongluo had asked Qing Shui to do so. At Demon Gate, Mo Hongluo was being called Mo Hongxiu. Only those of Demon Gate Elder Association and those from the Demon Clan knew that she was Mo Hongluo.</p>
 <p>No matter what it was, the Master of the Demon Gate pampered this daughter the most. Therefore, nobody had dared to say anything to Mo Hongluo.</p>
 <p>Landing at a spacious and empty place, Qing Shui then put away the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. The figure of an old man who was far away earlier already appeared there. Seeing the few people that arrived, the elders behind them smiled with joy.</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>Mo Hongluo called out excitedly. Seeing his daughter being the happiest she has been in so many years, he naturally was happy as well.</p>
 <p>“You must be Liu-Li,” the old man thought about Huoyun Liu-Li for a short while before saying. His voice was very benevolent. With the saying, love the house and its crow, perhaps Liu-Li was Hongluo’s daughter.</p>
 <p>[TL notes: Love the house and its crow: This is a Chinese idiom that means that you love everything about a person including his shortcomings. It is an analogy of how a person loved a house so much that he ending loving the crows that were there too.</p>
 <p>The old man did not have many children but there was a significant number of them, he even had a significant number of grandchildren. However, he looked upon the one before him differently.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li greets Grandfather before!” Huoyun Liu-Li said to the old man in a lukewarm tone.</p>
 <p>The old man laughed and he knew what she meant. After all, the old man had restricted Mo Hongluo’s freedom. There were something that had no explanation and there could not be an answer to it.</p>
 <p>“Alright, you have grown so much. This is for you. Consider this as a gift for meeting you for the first time. Take it as something to make up for what I have done.” the old man handed over what looked like a bracelet to Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was shocked by the amount of Spiritual Qi on it. He was stunned right as his Heavenly Vision Technique swept across it.</p>
 <p>Holy Bracelet!</p>
 <p>It would increase the cultivation speed of a cultivator by ten times!</p>
 <p>Strong and heaven defying, Qing Shui knew about the existence of such sacred objects long ago. He knew about it when he found out about the Spirit Concentrating Pill that could increase by six times. Later, he also saw this item as Mu Qing had one of the Holy Bracelet.</p>
 <p>The Holy Bracelet was the most basic of all the sacred objects. However, it had a special use. If a useless person has the Holy Bracelet in his hands, cultivating ten times the speed would turn him into quite a genius.</p>
 <p>The effect of the Holy Bracelet differed from one to another. The Holy Bracelet that the old man gave to Liu-Li was the most basic one and increased ten times of the cultivating speed. Mu Qing’s one enabled her to increase her cultivation speed by twelve times.. However, even the version that increased cultivation speed by ten times was already a heaven defying object.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not understand as to why the old man gave it to Liu-Li. Demon Gate was incomparably wealthy and had ample treasures, but it was not to the point where they could afford to give a Holy Bracelet to everyone.Mo Zitong would definitely had one and was definitely much better than this. There should be other good items he had, if not he would not be able to have two thousand stars strength given his age.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Mo Hongluo and could already be certain that her aptitude was not exceptionally good. Adding to her problems that she had over the years, her strength had already stopped at its peak. If she could accomplish her desire, she could perhaps make a breakthrough within a short span. She had already used the necessary Medicinal Pills and other items in her body and it was just that her mood had suppressed a significant portion of her strength.</p>
 <p>“Grandfather, this is the Holy Bracelet!” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>“Yes! Do you like it?” the old man laughed while looking at Huoyun Liu-Li</p>
 <p>“She does like it, but it is too precious.” Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Grandfather owes you this. No matter what it is, you are my granddaughter. You calling me Grandfather is already much better than this bracelet.” the old man smiled.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, take it. This is Grandfather’s token of regard.” Qing Shui laughed. He could actually tell what it meant. Besides, in the future, they could not draw a clear line with Demon Gate and would need the help of them.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Grandfather!” Huoyun Liu-Li thanked him and looked at the exquisite bracelet in his hands. A bright ray shone and Spiritual Qi radiated on the surface of it. However, once it recognized the Master, it would look like an ordinary bracelet.</p>
 <p>Sacred objects. Some sacred objects were terrifying, just like how Qing Shui obtained the Arhat Rosary Beads. Unless a Master dies, then the next person cannot become its Master.</p>
 <p>The Holy Bracelet did not go as far as that. As long as the one who received it erases the imprint on it and with some refining, it would be very simple.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, this is for you!”</p>
 <p>The old man took a Longevity Lock out and handed it to Qing Yu. It was unknown how many Longevity Locks Qing Yu received already, but this piece was made with silver essence containing high Spiritual Qi and had the effect of anti-poison.</p>
 <p>This was a token of regard from the old man. Qing Yu pouted her lip while taking it. To a child, this item would be more attractive if it were something they could eat.</p>
 <p>A few people walked in from the manor Qing Shui was at. This was where Mo Hongluo lived. In the past, people would generally not leave this manor. Those that were previously imprisoned would be imprisoned here.</p>
 <p>The time used up to rush back during the whole journey was about half a day. It was now time for another meal. Not long after he entered the room, a few people brought in some fragrant dishes.</p>
 <p>Everyone chatted while eating, the atmosphere was rather relaxed. Everyone would generally look ahead. At least Demon Gate and the Qing Clan were united. Huoyun Liu-Li was relaxed as well since she was able to settle her problems, as well as acknowledging her Mother and Demon Gate.</p>
 <p>Although they acknowledged each other, it did not mean that they had to always be together. The old man loved his daughter dearly and might have loved his granddaughter, he might even notice the presence of Qing Shui, who was negligible. The wisdom of an elderly was sharp.</p>
 <p>“Old Master, what is the situation at the Buddha Sect Nine Gate now? I heard that the Masters of the Buddha Sect Nine Gate is not as united as before.” Qing Shui asked while eating.</p>
 <p>The old man was not baffled by it. He then laughed, “The Buddha Sect seems to not be united on the surface, but if anything were to happen, they are very united. For example, if someone were to kill one from either Sect, they are intimately interdependent and will definitely interfere.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did know about it and hence did not expect that he would only have to face the Buddha Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>“Old Master, how is the Huoyun Clan of Buddha Sword Sect?”</p>
 <p>“Very strong, the Buddha Sect Nine Gate are all strong. If they were to battle with Demon Gate, Demon Gate will not be an opponent of the Buddha Sect. However, even if they won, there will be many casualties. Additionally, if there were a few experts among Demon Gate that sneakily attacked, it could lead them to be under pressure and therefore this was the balance that has been maintained all the while.” the old man answered Qing Shui without being baffled about Qing Shui’s questions.</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Qing Shui laughed. The great sects had sent people that had the same apprehension as them. It is no wonder that as long as anyone from a Clan or Sect became an immortal, the rest could too. If an expert viewed them as an enemy and a few of them gets killed, if they would ran when the expert had arrived, they would sneak an attack on the elites of the younger generation from the Sect. If they do continue on as such, the sect might end up in a state where opinions differed, leading to a point of no return.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not ask again. He knew what to do. With such a strong Sect, he could only use his martial skills as there was no other way to do it. Hence, he stopped asking, however the old man laughed and said</p>
 <p>“Buddha Sword Sect is one of the Buddha Sect Nine Gate. Their Sword Art is known as the Buddha Swordplay. The teachings of Buddhism are very profound and legend says it was very strong as well. Even though I do not believe in Buddhism, the Buddha Swordplay was certainly strong. Their Sword Art has a profound power and was one that was incisive, firm, able to jolt opponents back at a fast speed. The main Sword art of Buddha Sword Sect is the Buddha Swordplay.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui listened quietly. The old man had said what the opponent would not want to get their moves being meddled with. Qing Shui could not understand the thinking of the old man and did not know what he was thinking.</p>
