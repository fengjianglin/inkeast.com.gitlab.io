 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From his voice, Qing Shui could tell that the Second Palace Lord liked Qing Hanye a lot. This wasn’t weird, it was just that he was now sure of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Qing Shui didn’t think that Qing Hanye would have a picture of him. If he guessed correctly, that picture was drawn by her, and she even let the Second Palace Lord see it, which felt a little weird to Qing Shui, but he knew that she was doing it deliberately to spite the Second Palace Lord. She was still indifferent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she really cared, it seemed that it was hard for her to say, unless she knew a few years ago that he would be where he was. If that was the case, it made Qing Shui feel a little uneasy from head to foot, and made him think that she was indifferent even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know why he was suspicious of Qing Hanye’s actions before, but perhaps it was because more time had passed. He shook his head to get rid of these eerie thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Qing Shu!”</span></p>

He felt that the topic was not one that he needed to talk to the man in front of him about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I came here today to find you,” the Second Palace Lord said warmly. Now he was even more peaceful than before, to the point where Qing Shui couldn’t feel the waves of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was hard to determine the strength of the other at this point. Perhaps the auras of some people were really weird. Even if he was stronger, it was hard to feel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now what are you here to talk to me about?” Qing Shui already was able to guess a big part of it. The other person wasn’t here to come drink with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t see anything too special about you, so I was wondering why she liked you,” the Second Palace Lord’s aura became very sharp, like the glow from razor-sharp needles..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smile on Qing Shui’s face didn’t change, and he wasn’t made uncomfortable by the presence of the other person. He said to him, “Before I thought that you weren’t too bad, but now I know why she doesn’t like you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” The color of the Second Palace Lord’s face changed. This time he couldn’t keep his composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye was his weakness. Just like the seven inches of a snake, once it had been grasped, nothing it could do was effective. What Qing Shui said had hit where it hurt most. This move made his mind very turbulent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A man, a strong, handsome man has vision and boldness. You can assess whether you possess any of those qualities,” Qing Shui didn’t have any good feelings toward that man, but not because he liked Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha ha ha, the boldness of a man isn’t to let his own woman be taken,” the Second Palace Lord suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now it’s even harder for me to acknowledge you,” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t need you to acknowledge me. All I know is that you’ll have nothing to say once I beat you,” the Second Palace Lord’s eyes turned a shade of green, as though they were a wolf’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eyes of the Dragonwolf!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the eyes of the Second Palace Lord became a dark red, emanating an ominous glint that threatened to kill. People that didn’t have strong willpower would have been scared stiff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, that would only apply to normal people or people that had low cultivation. Qing Shui wasn’t so easily affected, but he knew these eyes of the Second Palace Lord weren’t only for scaring enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragonwolf eyes were a innate bloodline battle skill that transferred through the Dragonwolves. Once the Dragonwolf eyes were activated, they would greatly increase sensory powers. It would also see the actions of other people at a slower speed. As for how much slower, that would depend on the user’s strength and the opponent’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides this, the Dragonwolf eyes were also called the Eyes of Hell, as it could affect spirits. This was not affected by strength, and since Soul Energy could be counted as Spirit Energy, if one’s Spirit Energy wasn’t stable enough, it would also be affected by these eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s eyes squinted. It was just like the glow from needles, a gold, pale light of disorientation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha’s True Eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought that it was better to be careful. He couldn’t be careless during times like this. After all, he couldn’t determine the strength of the Second Palace Lord of the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. People that were able to do that would potentially be able to cause him harm. If he died because he was careless, then tears would come too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From what Qing Shui knew so far, even the strongest Martial Artists had one life. If they lost their head, they’d die. Even if they were revived the head wouldn’t grow back, but regrowing hands, feet, legs, or arms were still possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two red beams of Spirit Energy and two pale beams of gold hit each other, affecting the area to an unthinkable degree. They even stuck together and didn’t dissipate, a colorful chlorine-like energy emanating where the beams crossed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Battle Halberd appeared in his hand within a second, and he raised all his strength to the apex. Sometimes the one that attacked first had the advantage, and since he understood the Dragonwolf Palace a bit, he knew that their specialty was on sensory skills, meaning that their strength was the same as a dragon, their smell, ferociousness, and stealth the same as wolves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this, he knew that he couldn’t cheap out on defense. Qing Shui’s specialty was his defense, but his attack was also just as good. In addition, he had speed, but he didn’t want to use his defense, instead deciding to use his strong attack power to wear down the enemy. He didn’t like the person in front of him. Even if he wouldn’t be his enemy forever, he would never his friend, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At times like this, he couldn’t afford to give himself any doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique were practiced and combined in many different ways, and now they were already combined with the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique. He could quickly destroy his enemy’s weapons with the technique’s strong attack power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He already combined his Spirit Energy and his own Origin Qi. Although it hadn’t been brought to the point of perfection, Qing Shui had already brought it to a higher stage. The world of the Divine was just the Heavenly Dao Power and this mysterious power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Battle Halberd and the weapon of the Second Palace Lord clashed and a colorful light shined. In an instant, the hills around the area were leveled and smoke diffused, but was quickly combined into the surrounding water, which boiled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power of the Dragonwolf Clan was indeed strong. Qing Shui’s own strength could be said to be pretty strong too, especially his physical body, but all his attack did was move his opponent back a few steps. It didn’t even hurt him.</span></p>
