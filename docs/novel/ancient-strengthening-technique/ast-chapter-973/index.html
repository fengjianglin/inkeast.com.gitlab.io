 <p><strong>AST 973 - The Formidable Skywolf Claw</strong></p>
 <p>The day was still early. Qing Shui had passed them the required things, including the Formation Techniques. It was still very easy to make arrangements for the night. Qing Zun and Qing Yin had already been sleeping separately from Canghai Mingyu but Mingyue Gelou and Shi Qingzhuang’s children hadn’t yet.</p>
 <p>It was even impossible for Huoyun Liu-Li’s child. Thus, the first bedroom that Qing Shui visited was Canghai Mingyue’s. Even a reunion after a brief parting would be just as sweet as a honeymoon. On top of that, it had been a few years. This made even a kingdom toppling beauty like Canghai Mingyue a little nervous.</p>
 <p>This amused Qing Shui and also greatly tempted him. He was admiring the woman who was at the edge of the bed. She didn’t look any different even after delivering two children. She was still as devastatingly beautiful as she had always been. Her face had a faint red tint and her beauty was very impressive as always. It made one want to look up to her but in a different way to how one would look up to a Queen. Qing Shui leaned against her side, sharing the same snowy white blanket that covered their bodies.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very fond of the fragrance in the bedroom. It was sweet and pleasant. He also loved the faint fragrance coming from his side. His shoulder pressed against hers. His head was turned to the side as he lovingly admired her gorgeous profile.</p>
 <p>“You had to take care of the two children alone. Was it hard on you?” Qing Shui pulled her into his arms and gently embraced her.</p>
 <p>“No, they are our children. My flesh and bones. I am only grateful, how would it be hard on me?” Canghai Mingyue leaned into Qing Shui’s arms as she laughed softly.</p>
 <p>“The two children have a closer resemblance to you.” Qing Shui pointed out with a smile as he thought about Zun’er and Yin’er.</p>
 <p>“But they are actually very fond of their father. It’s just that Zun’er isn’t really good with words and Yin’er is very shy.” The smile on Canghai Mingyue’s face was especially warm when she talked about her son and daughter.</p>
 <p>“Our children are the best. They should start cultivating.” Qing Shui said softly, seemingly a little helpless about it. The Qing Clan could already be considered an aristocrat clan now. It was still vital for the next generation to be well nurtured, so they must cultivate. Thus, Qing Shui was thinking of some methods during the day time to get Qing Ming to agree with cultivating.</p>
 <p>“Zun’er loves to practice martial arts. However, Yin’er doesn’t seem to have much interest in it.” Canghai Mingyue said with a slight worry.</p>
 <p>“That’s fine. No need to worry about our daughter. I will agree to whatever she wants to study. It’s fine if she doesn’t want to cultivate. I will find some Gifted Earth Treasures to help her.” Qing Shui said after thinking for a moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was curious to see what that lass was interested in. When the time came, she’d be cultivating in a different way.</p>
 <p>“We mustn’t spoil the children.” Canghai Mingyue shook her head.</p>
 <p>“You think Yin’er would be spoiled? That lass is very intelligent, she just doesn’t show it. You don’t have to worry about it.” Qing Shui was especially happy when he remembered the way Yin’er looked at him fondly during the daytime and the wise look in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“It’s getting late. Let’s sleep!” Qing Shui suddenly pulled her into an embrace again and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>The bedroom was soon filled with noises that made one’s blood race. Qing Shui was admiring Canghai Mingyue’s gorgeous countenance. She looked as if she was lost in pleasure. Her alluring lips were slightly parted, letting out soft moans. The wonderful feeling was simply ecstatic.</p>
 <p>They only stopped about two hours later. Canghai Mingyue didn’t ask for Qing Shui to stay the night in her bedroom. She knew that there were still people waiting for him.</p>
 <p>“This is too troublesome. We should get a huge bed next time. That will be much more convenient.” Qing Shui smiled mischievously at Canghai Mingyue as he dressed himself.</p>
 <p>“Don’t even think about it.” Canghai leaned towards the edge of the bed, The afterglow on her face almost made Qing Shui strip off the clothes that he had just put on himself.</p>
 <p>He embraced her and kissed her with all his might before leaving!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only went to Huoyun Liu-Li’s bedroom after midnight. She wasn’t asleep yet and smiled when she saw Qing Shui. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and immediately climbed onto her bed.</p>
 <p>The little lass was in a deep sleep. He lowered his head and planted a kiss on his daughter’s delicate cheek.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li embraced Qing Shui from behind. “I missed you!”</p>
 <p>It only took these brief words for Qing Shui to quickly strip both of their clothes off. He stared into her long and narrow lovely eyes as he embraced her delicate figure that had grown a little fuller compared to before.</p>
 <p>……….</p>
 <p>Looking at Huoyun Liu-Li who was sleeping contently in his arms and his young daughter who was sleeping soundly at one side, Qing Shui felt extremely happy. Since there was still some time left, Qing Shui got up as he didn’t feel sleepy. He quietly left and entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>There was currently a little more than two hours before daybreak. Qing Shui was thinking about Mingyue Gelou’s weapon, the Beast Claw.</p>
 <p>The Skywolf Claw!</p>
 <p>He thought of the claw that was left behind when he killed the Skywolf before and immediately searched for it. He took the first two for building the frame and then added the violet jade along with some pure gold. He had gotten the pure gold from melting a small part of the Pure Gold Dragon-Headed Cane.</p>
 <p>Refine!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui refined the Skywolf Claw first. The forepart of this kind of claw wasn’t made of bone and was harder than pure metal. It was also extremely sharp. With a frame available, it was much more convenient to forge.</p>
 <p>Only a little bit of pure gold was added while mostly violet jade was used. This was Qing Shui’s first time forging claw-type weapons. The Skywolf Claw was about two feet long. The most notable thing about Claw Fist Techniques were the effects it had in transmitting ‘dantian’s qi’, just like the sword qi weapons. Other than not being sturdy enough, an ordinary sword would break or shatter because the transmission of dantian’s qi was too weak.</p>
 <p>Violet jade, pure gold, and that Skywolf Claw frame were all excellent materials for forging weapons. On top of that, Qing Shui’s current abilities in the Pentacolor Rainbow Art of Forging were still quite formidable. He was definitely the best in the five continents.</p>
 <p>There should be a lot of people who could forge weapons with an additional effect of threefold increase in strength. But the difference between their success rates and Qing Shui’s were like the Heaven and the Earth. Additionally, the weapons that were forged by Qing Shui would occasionally possess some special additional abilities.</p>
 <p>When a flash of pentacolor light shone, Qing Shui smiled at the splendid and magnificent Skywolf Claw before his eyes. Even a picky person like Qing Shui couldn’t help but sigh in amazement at the beauty of the Skywolf Claw. It was even sharper than the Violet Jade Sword.</p>
 <p>He immediately took a look at the Skywolf Claw’s abilities.</p>
 <p>Skywolf Claw: Wearer will possess a very strong poison immunity. Increases strength twofold. Additional 10% chance of doubling damage. Increases attack speed by 5%.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised when he saw the Skywolf Claw’s abilities. Although it was not as powerful as the Violet Star Thunder God, this Skywolf Claw was definitely a very decent weapon for opponents lower than Martial Emperor. It was quite a lot stronger than the Violet Jade Sword.</p>
 <p>That 10% chance of doubling damage mustn’t be underestimated. A 10% chance meant that it would happen once every ten times on average, and it could even consecutively happen twice. Then again, it was possible that it wouldn’t happen even once in twenty times. But then again, a 10% chance was definitely not little during battle.</p>
 <p>An increase of twofold meant that the wearer’s strength would be multiplied by three. Doubling on top of that would mean multiplying it again by two. Qing Shui was even a little envious right now. If only the Violet Star Thunder God could have such an additional ability…...</p>
 <p>But then he still remembered what Qin Zongheng had mentioned. There wouldn’t be any cultivator with a strength of more than 5,000 stars in the five continents. Even if some other cultivators from outside the five continents with more than 5,000 stars strength came here, their strength would also be restricted to 5,000 stars. This worked a little similarly to the Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
 <p>If this was really true, then wouldn’t Qing Shui be invincible here in the five continents if his strength reached 5,000 stars……?</p>
 <p>Looking at the time, it should be almost morning. He exited the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and saw that the sky outside had turned bright. The people who were doing their morning practice should be up by now. The moment he went out, he saw Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“Morning!” Qing Shui greeted Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue gave Qing Shui a rare charming glance. When she saw the slightly naughty smile that Qing Shui gave her, she immediately blushed a little when she recalled the events of last night. Although their children were already seven years old, her time spent with Qing Shui after their marriage was a lot less than that.</p>
 <p>“Is Zun’er up?”</p>
 <p>“He has already started cultivating in the morning since two years ago. He’s at the backyard right now!”</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll go see if Ming’er is awake.”</p>
 <p>“He’s there too. He has actually started following the rest to cultivate about two months ago.He only wanted to get some benefits from you that day.” Canghai Mingyue laughed.</p>
 <p>“This brat is already deceiving people at such a young age. What are we going to do with him?” Qing Shui was speechless.</p>
 <p>“Gelou is someone with virtue and dignity. Who do you think Ming’er takes after?” Canghai Mingyue chuckled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui extended his arm and groped Canghai Mingyue’s perky rear before leaving with a laugh. Canghai Mingyue cursed inwardly with a crimson face as she watched Qing Shui leave. Nonetheless, her heart kind of warmed. This was life. It would have been good if this man stayed home all the time.</p>
 <p>At the backyard, he discovered that other than Qing Yu, the rest were there too. Qing Shui saw Qing Zun with a single glance. The little guy was practicing Tiger Form and had already somewhat grasped the qi stance. Qing Ming, on the other hand, looked stiffer.</p>
 <p>The two lasses, Qing Yin and Qing Yan, were slower but nevertheless seemed decent. Qing Bei, Qing You, Qing Qing and the others were practicing alone at one side.</p>
 <p>Those who wanted to practice Tiger Form would look at Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou was cultivating the Tiger Form right now and then guided a few children. She was currently practicing by herself. Every time she struck out, a snowy white tiger claw would be unleashed from her palm. That was materialized from the qi of Xiantian. Qing Shui could see the form. But due to her strength, it didn’t seem mighty to him. But of course, it was still formidable for opponents on the same level as her.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, Mother said that you are good at it so you’ll be the one to teach me. And where’s my bow?” Qing Ming ran over. He was looking at Qing Shui with his pair of shining black eyes.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for Canghai Mingyue, Qing Shui wouldn’t be able to tell that the child was lying because he didn’t seem like he was doing so right now. “Give Daddy a few more days. I will find you a good one.” He laughed.</p>
 <p>Qing Ming could only nod his head. Qing Shui patted him. He then glanced towards Mingyue Gelou, who had already stopped and was coincidentally also looking towards him.</p>
 <p>“Catch! Give this a try!” Qing Shui tossed the Skywolf Claw that he had forged towards her.</p>
 <p>“It’s gorgeous!”</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou exclaimed with a smile when she caught it. The moment she put it on, she gave Qing Shui an amazed look. Her beautiful eyes sparkled with an extraordinary splendor. She then started to practice her Tiger Form.</p>
 <p>Her power was instantly raised by a few folds. She slowly executed the moves of the Tiger Form. The snowy white tiger claw that she unleashed had become a lot bigger and appeared to be much sharper. She suddenly unleashed a Critical Tiger Attack. A tiger claw that was a lot bigger than the earlier ones instantly exploded. It was at least a fold more powerful than before. This instantly stunned Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>“10% chance of doubling your damage again.” Qing Shui explained to her from the side.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou instantly felt relieved and came over happily. “Mother, let me have a look at it.” Qing Ming said when he saw Mingyue Gelou approaching them.</p>
 <p>“Ming’er, this is not something a child can play with. It’s prickly.” Mingyue Gelou crouched down and explained to Ming’er.</p>
 <p>“I’m all grown up. I know better than other children, I’ll be careful.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled at Qing Ming’s words and looked towards Mingyue Gelou. Mingyue Gelou was instead smiling happily. He didn’t think that this little fellow would be this shrewd.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou took it off and left it on the ground. “If you can pick it up, then I’ll let you play with it.</p>
