 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speaking of walking the immoral path, there were actually many kinds to it. There was a joke in his previous incarnation, it was about a woman who insisted on dissecting her stomach to give birth to her child. She feared that once she successfully gave birth to her child, it would influence her life with her husband. At the moment when the child was born, the child’s grandpa already mentioned one thing, he said that the child wouldn’t walk a righteous path and that he would have a pathetic future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also some other that didn’t walk on the right path. For example, the happy moment between men and women. Other than just an ordinary happy moment, there were also some that were related to the imperial harem. That was meant by not walking on the right path. These were all self-taught. Even if this woman didn’t know exactly what was going on, she could still feel that it was not something good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t need men.” The woman said straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. To think that this woman would act so dominantly. Nevertheless, he still smiled and continued on to joke, “The reason you don’t need men is because you have yet to feel how good a man can be. In the future, once you have found yourself a man, you will know that women can’t live without men.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman stopped saying anything. Qing Shui injected the needle into the top part of her breast. It didn’t hurt, but it made her feel numb and ticklish. It felt like someone used their hand to rub it. That feeling was difficult to bear. It was even harder to endure than pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman blushed. After all, Qing Shui injected the needle at quite an awkward position. Though there was a cloth in the way, she still felt a bit unnatural about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have gotten enough asset to be proud.” Qing Shui once again injected three needles as he spoke. The reason why he talked, was to make the situation between them less awkward. However, at the moment he said that, he only made the situation even more awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You aren’t anything good too.” The woman lifted up her head and shot Qing Shui a glare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s so unreasonable. I am trying to compliment you. Back in where I live, those that have huge breasts often tend to be very confident. It’s only when they are big that a woman is considered to be a true woman.” While Qing Shui was injecting the needles, it was unknown whether he did it on purpose or by accident, his fingertip slightly rubbed past the top of her breast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You vulgar and shallow man. What a woman has from the inside is what makes them even more beautiful.” The woman slightly trembled. But then she noticed that Qing Shui didn’t seem to know that he had touched her, making her also unsure whether he did it intentionally or by accident. At that instant, she almost moaned. Luckily, she managed to control it. That feeling was very hard to bear, but at the same time, there was also a kind of comfort which was indescribable. It even caused her to subconsciously felt like letting Qing Shui go and squeeze both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This intention made her feel as if she was being burned. Deep down, she had even begun to blame herself. She was an ordinary woman, hence, she would naturally have emotions just like other humans. Her only difference was that she wouldn’t look up to ordinary men. Even if it meant she would have to live a solitary life, she would still be unwilling to let those men take advantage of her. This was because she wouldn’t feel happy about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since she couldn’t find happiness in it, why do something unnecessary?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every woman tended to be very emotional, no matter how rational they might be. On many occasions, they would use their feelings as a guide. They would rather believe in their own feelings than facing the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui extended his arms, a formless energy carried up the woman and brought her in front of him. Qing Shui’s head was almost at the same level as the woman’s underbelly. This caused the woman to feel even more embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman had slender legs. While in the air, she looked very attractive. Though it was separated by a cloth, her beautiful and goddess-like body could still make people go wild with their imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Put me down.” The woman quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, do you want me to squat down in front of you instead?” Qing Shui lifted his head and looked at the woman. He moved his sight from the bottom to the top. Her upright breasts were soul-takingly attractive. Both of them were bulging and were perfectly shaped. Qing Shui was unable to control himself and took a gulp of his saliva down his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Qing Shui was awkward about, was the sound of him gulping. It was also a bit loud. Being in a place where the surrounding was so quiet, the noise was even more obvious. Furthermore, both of his eyes were fixed on the woman’s breast. The woman witnessed all of these things happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a bit panicked and scared. If the man in front of her was to lose control over himself, she wouldn’t have any ways of stopping it. Other than that, it was also because she felt something she has never felt before in her life. It was the fact that this man could still act a bit arrogant despite being in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s a normal reaction, please don’t overthink about it.” After finding an excuse for himself, Qing Shui quickly continued injecting the needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui who turned serious stopped looking at the bulging spots on the woman’s body. This caused the woman to let out a sigh of relief. Now, she was the one looking back at Qing Shui. He didn’t look that bad, in fact, he could be considered handsome. Though looking a bit gentle and reserved, he didn’t make people felt that he wasn’t manly. He also looked a bit bewitching, but not to the point that people would find it awkward. That was a very unusual temperament and attractiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His strength was very obscure. Despite his young age, he had formidable cultivation which wasn’t in the least inferior compared to herself. Even if she was at her peak, she might not be that much stronger than him. However, she was considerably older than him. Nevertheless, to them, people beyond the age of a hundred was still considered young, let alone the woman’s age wasn’t beyond a hundred. It was just when compared to Qing Shui, she was considerably older.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when Qing Shui injected the needle into her perineum, the woman’s face turned totally red. Her face at that moment looked extremely gorgeous. Qing Shui, on the other hand, remained silent and lowered his head. His face also looked a bit red, because of the very close distance and the position in which the Gold Needle was injected in. Despite there was a cloth in the way, the part which the needle was injected into was still one of the most embarrassing position. That soft and spongy sensation caused Qing Shui’s hand to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five Elements Art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five Elements Compatibility, Qing Shui’s Gold Needle which he injected into the woman’s body turned into Five Elements Compatibility and boosted the toughness of her organs. The organs across a human’s body were originally already equipped with the function to remove poisons. Particularly, the organs of experts, they were even tougher than ordinary people. However, there would still be a limit to how tough it could get. Once a person got affected by poisons, their organs would only fail gradually. As time went on, their organs would become weaker and weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no medicine which could treat the poison Beauty Fatal Death which the woman received. The only way for her to recover was for her to remove it herself. Hence, Qing Shui adjusted her organs to its peak so that it could be strong enough to remove the toxin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, it could be said that many physicians would know about this method of treating illnesses. The sole problem was that they couldn’t manage to make adjustments to the woman’s organs. Actually, Qing Shui was also unable to do it. In the sense that, he couldn’t make her organs resist against the poison within her body. However, it wasn’t necessary for Qing Shui to do so. All he needed to do was to make adjustments to it for just a temporary period of time, long enough for her to remove the poisons out of her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman closed her eyes. She seemed to be able to feel Qing Shui’s eyes which made her feel a bit nervous. She could also vaguely sense that Qing Shui was staring at certain parts of her body. Actually, it was true that Qing Shui was looking at it, but he knew his limit. Nevertheless, he didn’t intentionally try to avoid it. Her cloth was in the way, but he still needed to inject the needles into her, and hence, he would casually take a look at it, which was a perfectly normal reaction from a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A warm sensation started spreading out across the woman’s body. It felt very comfortable. The woman clenched her teeth to prevent her expressions from changing. She also refused to let herself make any noise. The reason was because at the moment, both the comfortable feeling from within and the numb and ticklish feeling from the outside made her felt as if she was in the amalgamation of ice and fire. It was a mixed feeling of pain and at the same time a pleasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Gold Needle outside could be seen constantly shaking, making soft buzzing noises. From time to time, Qing Shui would poke the woman’s body. Naturally, it was unavoidable that he would poke some of the sensitive spots of the woman’s body. The soft and spongy sensation made Qing Shui almost lost control over himself.</span></p>
