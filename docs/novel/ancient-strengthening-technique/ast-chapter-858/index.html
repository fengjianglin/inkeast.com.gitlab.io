 <p><strong>AST 858 - Attending the banquet，Dong Yan and Sun Yan</strong></p>
 <p>“Brothers, why don’t you count me in?” Qing Shui looked like a Xiantian cultivator and perhaps even a low grade Xiantian cultivator if he did not show his actual abilities.</p>
 <p>Dong Yan and the considerably handsome 30 year-old looked at Qing Shui and laughed.</p>
 <p>This laughter seemed to have brought them together, as if they were birds of a feather.</p>
 <p>“I am Sun Yan!” the handsome man smiled.</p>
 <p>“I am Dong Yan. It’s my pleasure to meet you!” the mild-mannered middle-aged man said smiling.</p>
 <p>“I am Qing Shui. It’s my pleasure to meet both of you,” Qing Shui responded with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Good. It is getting late, the banquet must be starting. Let’s not delay any further!” Dong Yan grinned at the two other men.</p>
 <p>They got into a beast carriage and it sped quickly along the wide roads towards the Dongfang residence, as it swept pass the changing scenery.</p>
 <p>“Brothers, is the Dongfang Aristocrat Clan very rich and powerful?” Qing Shui was unsure if this particular Dongfang Aristocrat Clan was the one mentioned by the old man at the Golden Buddha Temple. However, seeing that they were in Dongfang City, he reckoned that this particular clan must still be very powerful and influential.</p>
 <p>“Dongfang Aristocrat Clan is the biggest clan in Dongfang City, I’m sure you can tell from its name. They are kind and charitable and the people here in Dongfang City only have praise for them. We are going to the wedding banquet of a talented member of their fourth generation, Dongfang Ye,” Dong Yan replied, smiling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could tell from the man’s tone that the Dongfang Aristocrat Clan had quite a good reputation. However, to Qing Shui, everyone had a reason to be good or bad. The reason wasn’t important to him, even if their purpose was to boost their reputation, it was a good thing that they were being charitable.</p>
 <p>People who deceived the public to gain reputation weren’t the worst. The worst were those who appeared to be charitable but instead donated to themselves. Such actions are detestable. They may appear to be open and aboveboard but they only care about their own benefits, even to the extent that they could boldly justify their actions by declaring that other people should not reap the benefits of their efforts. These people were worse than the former. In other words, this was the difference between a poseur and someone truly despicable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not condemn them. It was a fact that many large clans in the World of the Nine Continent would usually bring benefits and advantages to the people around them. This was how their families established themselves in a particular city or country, gaining dominance in the region.</p>
 <p>They reached the residence of the Dongfang Aristocrat Clan very quickly. It was a huge magnificent-looking manor which was located in a bustling district. Three of the men got down from the carriage and just when Qing Shui was about to pay, Dong Yan laughed, “How can we let you pay for the trip? Just wait and see.”</p>
 <p>Dong Yan walked up to the lavishly decorated gates. A middle-aged man walked up to him and smiled saying, “Sir, are you here to attend the banquet?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes. May I ask if you work here?” Dong Yan smiled at the middle-age man.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am in-charge of some miscellaneous tasks,” the man replied, still smiling.</p>
 <p>“So you are the housekeeper? That’s fantastic. You see, I came here in a hurry so I forgot to bring any money. The ride here was a little expensive. I’d heard that Dongfang Aristocrat Clan is very generous, do you think…”</p>
 <p>“Sure, sure.”</p>
 <p>The man gestured to one of the guards. That guard immediately ran to the beast carriage and paid for the trip and even gestured politely for the three men to enter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a little stunned by Dong Yan’s antics. At that moment, many of the people who were entering and leaving the residence looked at the three men with contempt. Who would believe that these three men did not have the money to pay for their ride? Even though they were not well-dressed Xiantian cultivators not having enough money to pay for a carriage ride? What a joke...</p>
 <p>Of course, there were people who found that little incident quite hilarious. With this, there were comments about Dongfang Aristocrat Clan’s generosity and kindness. The housekeeper happily accepted these compliments on behalf of the clan.</p>
 <p>Dong Yan did not show any hint of embarrassment, Sun Yan even held his head high, just like a proud cockerel... And, Qing Shui looked totally like an outsider...</p>
 <p>The people around them seemed to be driven speechless by their behavior. Anyone would see them as a bunch of stingy people. They did not bring any congratulatory gifts, yet they even expected the Dongfang Aristocrat Clan to pay for their ride here. Who knows if they would need the family to pay for their trip back? If they did not have the money to come to this place, it was highly unlikely that they would have the money to go back...</p>
 <p>“It is a disgrace to attend a banquet with such guests,” a fat man sighed, shaking his head.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Why would these random people attend the banquet? I wonder if they have a invitation?” an ugly young man with a monkey-like face added.</p>
 <p>“Invitation? Do you think Dongfang Aristocrat Clan would send an invitation to such people?” that fat man replied, once again casting a look of disgust at the three men.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, do you know what a pig is?” Dong Yan laughed while he walked. Everyone could clearly hear his words.</p>
 <p>“This question is quite difficult, please enlighten me, Brother Dong,” Qing Shui asked, with a false look of seriousness on his face.</p>
 <p>“Phish!” Just then, a young lady laughed when she heard Qing Shui’s reply. That bell-like laughter was like a breeze in spring.</p>
 <p>Dong Yan contemplated for a moment, “Pigs are omnivorous mammals. They are heavy, their limbs are stubby, their movements are slow and they’re easy to rear but are stupid.”</p>
 <p>With this, laughter erupted from the crowd. Everyone knew who he was talking about and they looked at the fat man. The fat man was wearing a large silk coat and was definitely heavier than 500 jin. The man flushed red with anger as he stared at Dong Yan, unable to say a word.</p>
 <p>Dong Yan then looked at the monkey-faced young man. Looking similarly as ugly, the monkey-faced young man quickly left the fat man once Dong Yan eyed him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui disliked such people who criticized others to display their superiority, that was the reason why he cooperated with Dong Yan to annoy that man. He could tell that they were rather successful when he saw that man’s fuming face.</p>
 <p>In the end, the man left with his tail between his legs.</p>
 <p>Following the crowd, Qing Shui, Dong Yan and Sun Yan walked towards towards the manor. Just then, the beautiful young lady, who had laughed just some moments ago, approached them. “Uncle, that man is quite vengeful, you have to be careful.”</p>
 <p>“Young lady, thank you. We are just people of lowly status, he won’t waste his time with us.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The residence of Dongfang Aristocrat Clan was quite extravagant. After all, they were the largest clan in Dongfang City, so this was nothing unusual. All corners of the residence were dazzling and well-decorated. Once again, the family members of the clan welcomed their guests.</p>
 <p>They saw a large area with tables and chairs, that was where the banquet was held. There were many people already seated. There tables were filled with wine and dishes but everyone was busy talking.</p>
 <p>Birds of a feather flock together, this was also how the people grouped themselves. The other purpose of the banquet was for the guests to network so banquets that are held by such large clans usually do not have empty seats.</p>
 <p>“Look how lonely that fellow is, let’s go over and chat with him. See, nobody is willing to sit with him. How pitiful,” Dong Yan said, smiling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed when he looked over. Dong Yan was actually referring to the same fat man they had angered. Oddly, the ugly skinny man was not with him.</p>
 <p>As there were many people around, that comment did not go unnoticed. The fat man was so embarrassed that he even felt like dying. He almost wished that he could just dig a hole and hide himself in it. He wanted show-off by criticizing those men but he didn’t expect such a situation. He couldn’t even do anything against them. Nobody ever dares to cause any ruckus in Dongfong Aristocrat Clan’s residence but he would never forgive those men.</p>
 <p>Everyone around them knew that they were the three men who did not pay for their carriage ride. Humans are like that, they all like to watch a good show. The crowd watched them finding the situation hilarious.</p>
 <p>“This fat brother looked for a table without others because he is afraid that there won’t be enough food.” Dong Yan’s words almost made the fat man faint.</p>
 <p>“Come. I haven’t eaten since morning. Let’s start eating first. I don’t think the host will find fault with us.” Dong Yan passed Qing Shui and Sun Yan each a pair of chopsticks.</p>
 <p>They sat at the end seats of the banquet table. Even though there were no rules about eating. It was a fact that the banquet had not officially started. Besides, the people here did not come to the banquet to eat. With their statuses, they could eat whatever they wanted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took the chopsticks. He was clueless as to how to react with these two people. He only followed their funny antics because he could sense that these two people were not really Xiantian cultivators. Just like him, they were hiding their true strength. Unfortunately, he only knew that they were very powerful and was unable to tell their actual capabilities accurately, especially Dong Yan.</p>
 <p>People who could hide their actual strength from Qing Shui were definitely not ordinary. Furthermore, they even dared act in such a manner in Dongfang Aristocrat Clan, with no concern of how others viewed them.</p>
 <p>“I knew it was you, younger brother Dong Yan when I heard that there was someone who couldn’t pay for their carriage ride. Why didn’t you tell us first?” A gallant, strong laughter came from the distance.</p>
 <p>“Dongfang Third Elder!”</p>
 <p>“Dongfang Third Elder!”</p>
 <p>“Hi everybody. Just take a seat, eat whatever and enjoy the food. We are all friends here!” the man spoke with a straightforward tone, greeting everyone, giving a friendly impression.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Third Elder’s words stunned the other guests. He actually called the stingy man who didn’t even pay for his own ride his brother.</p>
 <p>Who was this man?</p>
 <p>Just then, not far from them, cold sweat appeared on the fat man’s forehead. He had ridiculed them just now, even though he did not say anything else after that. He could not believe that he even thought to seek revenge...</p>
 <p>“This is my nephew’s wedding. Of course, I came.” Dong Yan stood giving a sheepish smile.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Please sit over there. My big brother and second brother will come over shortly. You should help yourself with the drinks.” Dongfang Third Elder seemed very happy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, knowingly. Now everyone knew Dong Yan was no ordinary man. A person who Dongfang Third Elder acknowledged was definitely a somebody.</p>
 <p>“I won’t go over now. Let’s meetup after the end of the banquet. I have some friends here,” Dong Yan said, smiling at Dongfang Third Elder.</p>
