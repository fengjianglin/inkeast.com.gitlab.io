 <p><strong>AST 1340 - The Super Ren and Du Meridians Strengthening Pills Could Be Used Twice? Recklessness</strong></p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan wanted to leave, but she was pulled back by Qing Shui. With a yelp, she landed into Qing Shui’s arms.</p>
 <p>He had no idea if Tantai Xuan really wanted to leave or if she was just being reserved. During this hold up, Yehuang Guwu and Yu Ruyan had already left. Tantai Xuan threw Qing Shui a glance and grew silent, obstinately staring at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui naturally wasn’t intimidated. He was instead admiring her exquisite, jade-like skin from as close as possible. Her velvety and fair skin exuded a faint fragrant that was so irresistible that one would be tempted to take a bite out of her.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan instantly pulled backwards when Qing Shui leaned forward. “Don’t stick your tongue out, that’s so disgusting!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was taken aback and licked his lips. “Xuan’er… are you a germaphobe or are you just being cold?”</p>
 <p>“I’m neither…!” Tantai Xuan reached out to knock Qing Shui on his head.</p>
 <p>“But you were disgusted just now. Could it be that you’re pregnant? Come, let me take your pulse.” Qing Shui grabbed a hold of her delicate wrist while laughing.</p>
 <p>“Enough, Qing Shui. Stop fooling around.” Tantai Xuan pouted.</p>
 <p>“Then do you still feel disgusted?” Qing Shui smilingly asked her.</p>
 <p>“Not anymore. Qing Shui, let us just have a chat tonight, alright?” Tantai Xuan glanced at Qing Shui nervously.</p>
 <p>“That’s my plan. Xuan’er, were you thinking about doing something else?” Qing Shui carried on with his teasing.</p>
 <p>“Y-You’re a ridiculous, big meanie!” Tantai Xuan exclaimed in both embarrassment and anger.</p>
 <p>“Come, let us talk about our life goals on the bed.” Qing Shui lifted her up and moved towards the bedroom.</p>
 <p>She had a bedroom here, and of course the other bedroom was added in later for Qing Shui. The bamboo building at the place where Putuo Mountain had viewed as the most sacred of the sacred land actually included a bedroom for man. He wondered what the rest would think when they discovered that three of the most sacred women among the Putuo Mountain actually belonged to a man.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do not touch me. You can only do that when you make me fall completely in love with you.” Tantai Xuan didn’t struggle in Qing Shui’s arms, but instead wrapped her arms around his neck.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t stop either. “Don’t worry, as long as you don’t give me permission to put it in, I won’t do it. That’s good enough, right?”</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was taken aback by his words. They were vulgar and barbarous, yet still held a lot of impact. She couldn’t restrain herself from biting Qing Shui’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan wasn’t in love with Qing Shui. To be more exact, she wasn’t completely in love with him. A woman like her who chased after perfection would not be willing to wholeheartedly devote herself to a man as long as she wasn’t completely in love. If Qing Shui was persistent, then she wouldn’t strongly resist it either. However, it would certainly leave a sore spot in her heart.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui wasn’t some love expert, he still understood his own women. On top of that, being a person who had lived two lives, he had also gained some knowledge on human nature. He had already told Yehuang Guwu before that he might not devour Tantai Xuan tonight. In fact, he actually wished to do it only when the time was right.</p>
 <p>As for Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui had sworn that he would make her strip for him and take the initiative to ride him...</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui didn’t want to admit that even though he had said such daring words, he reckoned it was very unlikely to happen. Qing Shui would be in disbelief if the otherworldly woman just settled down on her own accord. Although there was no need to take things so seriously between a man and woman, Qing Shui would still try his best, because that scene was also something he looked forward to...</p>
 <p>The bedroom wasn’t big, but it was very cozy. The bamboo bed was covered by a jade-green bed sheet that was very thin, yet seemed especially comfortable. It looked indescribably harmonious when it was set against the green bamboos in the surroundings.</p>
 <p>The bamboo bed wasn’t too high, only reaching up to a person’s knees. It was a very exquisite and refined small bed. Although it was a little too narrow for two people to sleep on, it was quite spacious for a single person. Qing Shui looked at the bamboo bed in amusement. “Will it collapse under both of our weights?”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t allow you to come on my bed…”</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan’s lovely face was flushed. She had a pair of divinely gorgeous eyes that were somewhat otherworldly, graceful and deep. They also held a little perfection-seeking sensuality that was bone-deep. In Qing Shui’s eyes right now, her sensuality was unusually intense.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted her up and directly sat on the bed. Unexpectedly, the bed didn’t collapse. It only bounced for a little bit, without even making any noise in the slightest.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t a wonder either, as the bed was made out of special bamboo from the Southern Sea that was flexible yet extremely tough. Even under the weight of four people, it would also only be bouncy, let alone two people. Besides, Qing Shui had already experienced that effect on Yu Ruyan’s bed. He was only teasing Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>“Xuan’er, this bed is pretty good. It’s so bouncy. Oh right, Xuan’er, come explain to your husband how do you usually take care of your needs?” Qing Shui pressed against her body. A prideful lady like her must be given some intense encouragement, so he could bring out the lewd side within her.</p>
 <p>“You’re the only one who has needs…”</p>
 <p>“I do and I can feel it now again. Tell me, how should I take care of it?” Qing Shui smiled and slowly leaned his head towards her.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you forget what you said earlier.” Tantai Xuan pushed against Qing Shui’s chest with both of her hands.</p>
 <p>“Of course. I won’t be devouring you, but I still can do something else to you.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as one of his hands traveled slowly upwards from her delicate waist. The places he caressed caused Tantai Xuan to slightly shut her eyes and shiver in pleasure.</p>
 <p>Perhaps due to Qing Shui’s words earlier, she gradually calmed down. Her eyes were still shut and both of her arms were slack.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and pecked on her soft lips, sucking on them a little. Both of his hands were also gently caressing her waist and delicate back. Before he realized it, his hands had already gone underneath her clothes.</p>
 <p>The moment his hands came in contact with her well-rounded breasts, his tongue also managed to breach her clenched jaw and skillfully captured her wonderfully soft tongue.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan didn’t recall when she had opened her eyes, but her small face was fiery red.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui reached out and slowly undressed her. She didn’t resist it. She knew exactly what he wanted to do. That familiar scene was already imprinted on her mind.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui buried his head between her soft roundness, her body trembled the moment he sucked. Her arms were wrapped around Qing Shui’s heads, very tightly.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Xuan’er, you nearly suffocated me to death.” Qing Shui was embracing Tantai Xuan. The upper half of their bodies had been stripped of clothes. Tantai Xuan wouldn’t allow him to strip her any further and Qing Shui had no desires to find trouble, so he would have to make do with that.</p>
 <p>“You still dare say that...”</p>
 <p>When Tantai Xuan thought back to the earlier moment, she didn’t even realize when she had her arms wrapped around his neck. It was as if she wanted to stuff him into her body with all her might. That wasn’t good... this big meanie was going to tease her about it.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, I’m not gonna say anything. That tasted really good!”</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was speechless.</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui had the three ladies use the Two-Yang Pills and Three-Yang Pills. After using two Two-Yang Pills and two Three-Yang Pills, Yehuang Guwu’s instantly gained 16 sun of strength. This was neither a lot nor a little. The Yang Pill mainly brought great benefits to a body’s constitution, and these benefits were not at all inferior to a direct increase of strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also used two pills. Unfortunately, the pills weren’t for increasing physical strength. Though his increase was only very little, his strength was still much stronger than that of Yehuang Guwu.</p>
 <p>However, it was different for Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan. Their strengths were nearly doubled. This was how powerful the Yang Pills were. The exponential increase of strength wasn’t only stable in its foundation, but also the Yang Pills also had the effects of establishing the foundation and enhancing constitution and bones.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a feeling that his constitution and bones had been enhanced by most. Perhaps this was due to his Nine Yang Golden Body constitution.</p>
 <p>He recalled the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellets and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets that he had prepared for them. These two types of pellets had been strengthened by him. He then recalled the Double Portion Medication and a thought struck him. Could he use it again?</p>
 <p>Back then, Qing Shui had never considered using this type of medicinal pill two times. Now that he thought about it, it could probably work. It was just for strengthening, so there was no limit to it. Normally, a person could be strengthened twice, or even thrice. Of course, this was provided that they had a Triple Portion Medication.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t in a rush to test it out. It was going to be his second time after all, so he figured he should just let the few ladies to use them first. These two types of medicinal pills were considered the best for body strengthening, so it was good to let them use them before he left.</p>
 <p>The Ren and Du meridians were the most important meridians in the human body. They were blood vessels that could allow massive strength increases. The first person to use the pills was Yehuang Guwu. What shocked Qing Shui was that he wasn’t certain if it was due to the strengthening or because Yehuang Guwu’s strength was a lot more powerful than his prior to it, but Yehuang Guwu’s strength increased by a little more than onefold, reaching nearly 70,000 sun of strength. Both Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu were stupefied.</p>
 <p>This was a type of medicinal pill that had very special requirements towards a body’s constitution. The strength increase varied for each individual. Since it was not fixed, one’s strength could be amplified by between 50% to 300%. This was the result after being strengthened. Of course, it was could be less than 50% too, depending on the individual’s constitution and innate talents. Those with good innate talent would store the medicinal effect in their body. This meant that if one was too weak in strength to absorb it, it would gradually melt into the body and increase cultivation speed when cultivating in the future. The outcome was the same as using the pills with higher strength.</p>
 <p>The next ones to try were Tantai Xuan and Yu Ruyan. Qing Shui was once again amazed by the strength that the two ladies had gained, because their strength were increased by nearly twofold… But of course, twofold for them was still merely tens of suns, barely anything comparable to Yehuang Guwu. However, the medicinal effect stored within their bodies were much more than Yehuang Guwu. Even without cultivating in the future, their strength would still be increased gradually over time at a very fast pace, until the medicinal effect in their bodies was completely used up. The results on both of them were a lot better compared to when Qing Shui had consumed it back then.</p>
 <p>With the Double Portion Medication, Qing Shui reckoned that it would probably be great this time. He stopped hesitating in trying it out for himself too. They didn’t need any for now since their bodies had had enough. Yehuang Guwu had the most satisfying outcome. Her strength was very close to 70,000 sun. If she condensed it into White Tiger strength through the Tiger Form, it would be nearly 140,000 sun.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized that he had already been surpassed. Then again, around 150,000 suns of strength could still be taken care of during a fight.</p>
 <p>He consumed the Double Portion Medication and Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill.</p>
 <p>He hesitated for a moment before directly consuming the Double Portion Medication and Du Meridian Strengthening Pill.</p>
 <p>Soon enough, a wave of boundless energy erupted from within his meridians. Qing Shui instantly regretted it. His action earlier was simply too reckless.</p>
