  <p><strong>AST 193 – Fireworks grows cold quickly, beauty is transient</strong></p>
  <p>When it was almost dark, Yiye Jiange returned from Skysword Peak to Cloud Mist Peak. Her heart was restless throughout the day. She was still concerned about letting Qing Shui take a blanket from her. She regretted it, and now she only hoped that Qing Shui would not enter her bedroom. There were blankets in the closet outside, and she prayed that Qing Shui did not get the blankets from her yet. </p>
  <p>When she entered her house, and especially her bedroom, she turned expressionless. Her two sets of blankets were gone, but she didn’t feel that it was important now. She found out that she didn’t get the chance to put away her panties from this morning. It was under the blankets before, but now it was out in the open for display on the bed, and was obviously touched by someone. </p>
  <p>Suddenly, the goddess’s face turned scarlet like the dawn. Unfortunately, there was no one to appreciate this beautiful sight!</p>
  <p>“Die Qing Shui, stinky Qing Shui!” The more she thought about it, the more embarrassed she was. How could her used panties fall into that kid’s hands? Who knew what that kid was thinking about…?</p>
  <p>The Triannual Exchange Competition was disrupted by Qing Shui’s appearance. Both elders and youngsters felt that competition had suddenly become tasteless. After Baili Jinwei showed his great perfection stage for the eighth Xiantian level, no one dared to challenge him. After all, the Skysword Sect still had an old devil monkey who was at the peak of Xiantian.</p>
  <p>“Wasn’t the Skysword Immortal injured? How come he became more experienced and dedicated than before?”</p>
  <p>This wave of discussion made some people give up the idea of challenging him!</p>
  <p>Although the Exchange Competition usually lasted ten days, it ended in five days this time. The people from the other sects gradually left. Compared to the Exchange Competitions held before, this was the only one that made the Skysword Sect most flushed with success. Since Baili Jinwei had healed, everyone was deterred. In addition, the presence of Qing Shui, a gifted Skysword Sect youngster, dissipated the Skysword Sect’s worry for the next few hundreds of years.</p>
  <p>In the end, almost no one besides a few Elders of the bigger sects that wanted to get a share of Cang Lang Country participated!</p>
  <p>Shi Qingzhuang lived at Qing Shui’s place for a few days, and she left with Fen Xianggu after no one was injured in the Sect Exchange Competition. In a few days’ time, Qing Shui felt that Shi Qingzhuang obviously had more feelings for him, showing that a frozen side of the iceberg had melted away.</p>
  <p>During these few days, Qing Shui found that Yiye Jiange seemed to avoid him intentionally, and even the way she looked at him was strange. It made Qing Shui very uncomfortable. Is it because he used her blankets?</p>
  <p>Hm… Qing Shui thought about the panties that he touched… Qing Shui was stumped.</p>
  <p>“I made a mistake. I’m still new to this, so I lack experience!” Qing Shui felt remorse… </p>
  <p>Qing Shui thought about how he felt guilty for holding his goddess master’s panties, so he just tossed it on the bed… If he just took it that time, it wouldn’t be so troublesome like now. He will also have a souvenir… </p>
  <p>Could it be that she suspected he did something dirty with her used panties…? </p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that the matter was very serious and that he needed to clarify it. Otherwise, she will always use that uncomfortable gaze to look at him. He really couldn’t tolerate it anymore. The more he thought about it, the more restless he was, so Qing Shui went to Yiye Jiange and called her out. </p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you’re in such a hurry to find me. What’s so urgent?” Yiye Jiange asked, amazed, as she was walking down the stairs. It was the first time that Qing Shui was so urgent to find her.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui tried hard to speak seriously, “Master, I need to talk about that time when I went to get the blankets from your room. I saw your panties accidentally, and at the time, I thought it was strange that even a goddess-like master would wear panties… It was a little unimaginable. In order to make sure that I was not dreaming, I grabbed it with my hands. I swear that I didn’t use it to do anything else.” Qing Shui felt relieved after finishing his words with one breath.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange lowered her head, and her face was bright red. Qing Shui talked so fast that she didn’t have time to stop him. Especially when she heard that she actually wore panties, Yiye was embarrassed, speechless, and a little happy at the same time because she actually had quite some status in his heart… </p>
  <p>“Did you want to find me to say this?” Yiye Jiange calmed down and said softly. </p>
  <p>“Yah. These few days… you looked at me as if I was a dirty uncle. I felt really awkward, so I needed to clarify. Or else, I won’t be able to sleep.” Qing shui said with a bitter expression.</p>
  <p>When Yiye Jiange heard that Qing Shui didn’t do anything with her panties, she was a little embarrassed, but also a little baffled. What can you do with a pair of panties? She didn’t know that there were a lot of dirty things in Qing Shui’s head. Among all the things he heard from books and other people, there were some about undergarments… </p>
  <p>It was quickly approaching Chinese New Year after the Exchange Competition had ended. It was festive everywhere at Skysword Sect. It was the first time that Qing Shui spent Chinese New Years outside his home. Unconsciously, a year had passed. Qing Shui thought about the Qing Clan, and his train of thought also flew to the Qing Clan as he remembered the sight of when he was celebrating at the Qing village. </p>
  <p>“I hope Mother is ok. Mother should be thinking of me, and she must be worried for me. I hope the others in the Qing Clan are okay! When I left, Feng Yanfei was also pregnant, and she must have given birth to Qing Zi’s child. It meant that the fourth generation of the Qing clan was born!”</p>
  <p>He thought about Mingyue Gelou and the little girl. He didn’t know whether they would be celebrating with the Qing Clan as well or if they would still stay with the Qing Clan. Mingyue Gelou’s shadow was very deep in Qing Shui’s heart, and he couldn’t forget that pure, holy, dignified, and beautiful woman.</p>
  <p>“Daddy!”</p>
  <p>A cheerful voice sounded, breaking Qing Shui’s train of thought. When he lifted his head, he saw Yiye Jiange holding the hand of Luan Luan who was dressed like an angel and walking towards him. The sight of an extraordinarily refined goddess with a devastatingly pretty loli was so beautiful like a mist, making him dazzled and stunned. </p>
  <p>“What happened? Did you miss your home and your mom?” Yiye Jiange’s tender voice sounded. Although Qing Shui heard this musical voice for a year, he still felt a great joy.</p>
  <p>“Mom? Why don’t I have a mom? I want a mom…” Luan Luan suddenly said noisily.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange looked at each other, then looked at the little girl whose eyes were filled with the radiance of hope.</p>
  <p>“Luan Luan, actually, your Auntie is your mom. Remember how happy she looked when she first saw you? She was scared that you wouldn’t recognize her, so she said that she was your aunt. Don’t you think that you look like her? She is the nicest and closest person to you.” Qing Shui made something up helplessly. Since Luan Luan was still young, she would believe whatever anyone said, so he could only lie to make her happy. Four or five-year olds were at a stage when they had fuzzy memories.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange had a light smile as she watched Qing Shui communicate with the little girl. She was happy. Maybe it was because she knew the soul-deep loneliness from not having parents or relatives, but she didn’t want the little girl to feel this way again. </p>
  <p>To make sure that the little girl believed it, Yiye Jiange nodded her head and said that it was true. When the little girl happily called “dad” and “mom”, Yiye Jiange’s face turned scarlet. Qing Shui looked at and hugged a happy Luan Luan. The sight was so beautiful it could make one suffocate. They combined together happily, heavenly, beautifully, and perfectly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had planned to spend his Chinese New Year with Huoyun Liu-li at Earthly Paradise, but he couldn’t handle Luan Luan’s disturbance. In addition, Yiye Jiange was also lonely by herself. It was better now though since she had another angel-like daughter. Another reason Qing Shui stayed on the mountain was to accompany Wenren Wu-shuang. </p>
  <p>He didn’t get the chance to meet Huoyun Liu-li even though half a year had passed. Huoyun Liu-li was actually quite lonely by herself. Fireworks subsided quickly; beauty was transient. Pretty woman were so lonely that they could only admire themselves!</p>
  <p>The fruits from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were ripe now, but there was no one to use them. Qing Shui gave Yiye Jiange two Endurance-Enhancing Fruits, and he also gave the little girl some. He also accumulated quite a bit of Drunken Fragrance Fruits. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui actually kept thinking about when he could reach the fourth layer in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was also concerned about the Life Extension Fruit and whether the little girl’s Seven Apertures Mystical Heart could be alleviated. Could the reward for the fourth layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal extend the little girl’s life?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui guessed that leveling up the spatial realm had to do with women. He made love with two women before, and the spatial realm levelled up twice. Could it be that whenever he made love with women, the spatial realm would level up? In multiple occasions, Qing Shui wanted to find those women who would do it for money. </p>
  <p>The New Year’s bell sounded. Under the light of the moon and the light stones, the entire Skysword Sect was beautiful. From the distance, it looked like a huge Moonlight Sword, a tilted finger like the blue dome of heaven looking disdainfully on the whole world. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange dragged the little girl for a stroll around the Skysword Mountain. Qing Shui was surprised that he could find pairs of young men and women; many of the men were the Protectors of the Skysword Sect, but there were also many Attendants. The women could only be from Zhu Qing Peak. Under the moonlight, they were especially intimate with each other and whispered to each other!</p>
  <p>Whenever they saw Qing Shui or Yiye Jiange and whether they were kissing or hugging, they would stop and say awkwardly, “Hello Jiange Master; hello Qing Shui Elder.”</p>
  <p>“We are just passing by. Sorry to bother you; you guys can continue!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui chuckled, making them and Yiye Jiange speechless.</p>
  <p>“Child’s mom, the Skysword Sect doesn’t ban interactions between males and females right?” Qing Shui chuckled. </p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange was obviously shocked and glanced at Qing Shui bitterly, but Qing Shui pretended to not see. He was mostly joking, but he regretted it as soon as he said it. He could only hope to end this matter quickly! </p>
  <p>“The Skysword Sect won’t ban interactions of mutual consent, but just don’t be too over the top…”</p>
  <p>Skysword Sect’s New Year was very monotonous. Although there were lights and banners everywhere, and the mood was festive, it was not comparable to the sight of Cang Lang Country’s night scene while standing on the mountain from afar.</p>
  <p>Except for the disciples on duty, everyone else actually could leave during New Year. They had a little more than half a month to go home and visit their relatives. </p>
  <p>When Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange brought the little girl to go sightseeing, he didn’t notice Wenren Wu-shuang who was by herself. When she saw Qing Shui standing with Yiye Jiange, along with an extremely cute little girl, she felt the scene was very harmonious, well-matched, and heartwarming. However, she felt a little disappointment in her heart. </p>
  <p>“You said that you would try your best to pursue me; you said you wanted me to be your woman, but why aren’t you ever by my side? Why am I not the one by your side? Why are you more and more distant from me?”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang silently looked at Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange’s silhouette become more and more fuzzy; the restraint in her heart also disappeared as she watched Qing Shui disappear.</p>
  <p>Two drops of clear tears slid off her beautiful eyes, and she turned around to walk towards Zhu Qing Peak. </p>

Especially when she heard that she actually wore panties, Yiye was embarrassed, speechless, and a little happy at the same time because she actually had quite some status in his heart… </p>
 <p>“Did you want to find me to say this?” Yiye Jiange calmed down and said softly. </p>
 <p>“Yah. These few days… you looked at me as if I was a dirty uncle. I felt really awkward, so I needed to clarify. Or else, I won’t be able to sleep.” Qing shui said with a bitter expression.</p>
 <p>When Yiye Jiange heard that Qing Shui didn’t do anything with her panties, she was a little embarrassed, but also a little baffled. What can you do with a pair of panties? She didn’t know that there were a lot of dirty things in Qing Shui’s head. Among all the things he heard from books and other people, there were some about undergarments… </p>
 <p>It was quickly approaching Chinese New Year after the Exchange Competition had ended. It was festive everywhere at Skysword Sect. It was the first time that Qing Shui spent Chinese New Years outside his home. Unconsciously, a year had passed. Qing Shui thought about the Qing Clan, and his train of thought also flew to the Qing Clan as he remembered the sight of when he was celebrating at the Qing village. </p>
 <p>“I hope Mother is ok. Mother should be thinking of me, and she must be worried for me. I hope the others in the Qing Clan are okay! When I left, Feng Yanfei was also pregnant, and she must have given birth to Qing Zi’s child. It meant that the fourth generation of the Qing clan was born!”</p>
 <p>He thought about Mingyue Gelou and the little girl. He didn’t know whether they would be celebrating with the Qing Clan as well or if they would still stay with the Qing Clan. Mingyue Gelou’s shadow was very deep in Qing Shui’s heart, and he couldn’t forget that pure, holy, dignified, and beautiful woman.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>A cheerful voice sounded, breaking Qing Shui’s train of thought. When he lifted his head, he saw Yiye Jiange holding the hand of Luan Luan who was dressed like an angel and walking towards him. The sight of an extraordinarily refined goddess with a devastatingly pretty loli was so beautiful like a mist, making him dazzled and stunned. </p>
 <p>“What happened? Did you miss your home and your mom?” Yiye Jiange’s tender voice sounded. Although Qing Shui heard this musical voice for a year, he still felt a great joy.</p>
 <p>“Mom? Why don’t I have a mom? I want a mom…” Luan Luan suddenly said noisily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange looked at each other, then looked at the little girl whose eyes were filled with the radiance of hope.</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan, actually, your Auntie is your mom. Remember how happy she looked when she first saw you? She was scared that you wouldn’t recognize her, so she said that she was your aunt. Don’t you think that you look like her? She is the nicest and closest person to you.” Qing Shui made something up helplessly. Since Luan Luan was still young, she would believe whatever anyone said, so he could only lie to make her happy. Four or five-year olds were at a stage when they had fuzzy memories.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange had a light smile as she watched Qing Shui communicate with the little girl. She was happy. Maybe it was because she knew the soul-deep loneliness from not having parents or relatives, but she didn’t want the little girl to feel this way again. </p>
 <p>To make sure that the little girl believed it, Yiye Jiange nodded her head and said that it was true. When the little girl happily called “dad” and “mom”, Yiye Jiange’s face turned scarlet. Qing Shui looked at and hugged a happy Luan Luan. The sight was so beautiful it could make one suffocate. They combined together happily, heavenly, beautifully, and perfectly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had planned to spend his Chinese New Year with Huoyun Liu-li at Earthly Paradise, but he couldn’t handle Luan Luan’s disturbance. In addition, Yiye Jiange was also lonely by herself. It was better now though since she had another angel-like daughter. Another reason Qing Shui stayed on the mountain was to accompany Wenren Wu-shuang. </p>
 <p>He didn’t get the chance to meet Huoyun Liu-li even though half a year had passed. Huoyun Liu-li was actually quite lonely by herself. Fireworks subsided quickly; beauty was transient. Pretty woman were so lonely that they could only admire themselves!</p>
 <p>The fruits from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were ripe now, but there was no one to use them. Qing Shui gave Yiye Jiange two Endurance-Enhancing Fruits, and he also gave the little girl some. He also accumulated quite a bit of Drunken Fragrance Fruits. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui actually kept thinking about when he could reach the fourth layer in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was also concerned about the Life Extension Fruit and whether the little girl’s Seven Apertures Mystical Heart could be alleviated. Could the reward for the fourth layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal extend the little girl’s life?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui guessed that leveling up the spatial realm had to do with women. He made love with two women before, and the spatial realm levelled up twice. Could it be that whenever he made love with women, the spatial realm would level up? In multiple occasions, Qing Shui wanted to find those women who would do it for money. </p>
 <p>The New Year’s bell sounded. Under the light of the moon and the light stones, the entire Skysword Sect was beautiful. From the distance, it looked like a huge Moonlight Sword, a tilted finger like the blue dome of heaven looking disdainfully on the whole world. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange dragged the little girl for a stroll around the Skysword Mountain. Qing Shui was surprised that he could find pairs of young men and women; many of the men were the Protectors of the Skysword Sect, but there were also many Attendants. The women could only be from Zhu Qing Peak. Under the moonlight, they were especially intimate with each other and whispered to each other!</p>
 <p>Whenever they saw Qing Shui or Yiye Jiange and whether they were kissing or hugging, they would stop and say awkwardly, “Hello Jiange Master; hello Qing Shui Elder.”</p>
 <p>“We are just passing by. Sorry to bother you; you guys can continue!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui chuckled, making them and Yiye Jiange speechless.</p>
 <p>“Child’s mom, the Skysword Sect doesn’t ban interactions between males and females right?” Qing Shui chuckled. </p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was obviously shocked and glanced at Qing Shui bitterly, but Qing Shui pretended to not see. He was mostly joking, but he regretted it as soon as he said it. He could only hope to end this matter quickly! </p>
 <p>“The Skysword Sect won’t ban interactions of mutual consent, but just don’t be too over the top…”</p>
 <p>Skysword Sect’s New Year was very monotonous. Although there were lights and banners everywhere, and the mood was festive, it was not comparable to the sight of Cang Lang Country’s night scene while standing on the mountain from afar.</p>
 <p>Except for the disciples on duty, everyone else actually could leave during New Year. They had a little more than half a month to go home and visit their relatives. </p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange brought the little girl to go sightseeing, he didn’t notice Wenren Wu-shuang who was by herself. When she saw Qing Shui standing with Yiye Jiange, along with an extremely cute little girl, she felt the scene was very harmonious, well-matched, and heartwarming. However, she felt a little disappointment in her heart. </p>
 <p>“You said that you would try your best to pursue me; you said you wanted me to be your woman, but why aren’t you ever by my side? Why am I not the one by your side? Why are you more and more distant from me?”</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang silently looked at Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange’s silhouette become more and more fuzzy; the restraint in her heart also disappeared as she watched Qing Shui disappear.</p>
 <p>Two drops of clear tears slid off her beautiful eyes, and she turned around to walk towards Zhu Qing Peak. </p>
