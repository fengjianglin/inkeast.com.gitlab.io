 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle started and ended quickly. They didn't show any leniency and the enemies were completely wiped out. Even though this was a battle between Divinities, there was no doubt about the outcome. They were unable to break through Qing Shui's defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's main worry had been that the opponent would turn their &nbsp;sights onto Yin Sha, Qingfeng, or Mingyue out of pure desperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle could be considered a huge victory. Other than Qing Shui, the rest of them all thought the same. Everyone were beaming happiness. This was the feeling of hope from the feeling of desperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw Tantai Lingyan smiling and nodded at him. Her quiet smile made him feel strangely peaceful . He felt that his lady wasn't as cold as she was before, although she was still cold, there was an indescribable feminine feeling coming from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you guys alright?" Feng Xi asked Qing Shui and the others, showing her concern for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're all fine, mother, this time around. It's all thanks to Qing Shui." Yin Sha said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew this. Anyone who had fought with Qing Shui before would feel that he was very dependable. After all, as long as he was around, everyone could have a tremendous boost in their powers and this wasn't something that they could estimate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is because of everyone's effort. Unity is strength. The mood and teamwork is also very important." Qing Shui said politely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Qing Shui said was true as well. The battle mood and teamwork could be replaced by formations and Unison Assault, as well as the control over the Heavenly Dao. Although it was rare for the weak to emerge victorious against the strong, such situations would still exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the previous battle , Qing Shui had not only used the Phoenix Battle Intent and other skills, but he also used formations and the Nine Palace Law as well. The Nine Palace Laws would accelerate the enemies' energy depletion, but could also allow some targets to slowly recuperate and save their energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's Nine Palace Laws had also been constantly improving. Right now he could lock onto his targets and choose whether to weaken or strengthen them. All it took was a single thought from Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to before, the Nine Palace Laws had improved a lot. The stronger it was, the more obvious the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still many people left in the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. All of them cheered at the Divine Moon Immortal Sect's victory. Everyone of them was so agitated as if they themselves were the ones who had won over those Divinities. This situation was to be expected after all. If Qing Shui and the others had lost or had even died, the rest of them wouldn't end up in a good situation either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Sha looked toward the people from the Divine Moon Immortal Sect and said, "Today, all of us shall have good food and drinks and celebrate!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one objected to this. After all, the greater the pressure the more they needed to relieve their stress and to relax. Although they had won today, the threat wasn't completely over either. Very soon, even more powerful cultivators would appear. It was impossible for things to end calmly between both sides. With how the situation had occurred, no one would want to end things amicably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and the others also ready for a sumptuous feast. Qing Shui, Yin Sha, Qingfeng and Mingyue had all washed up before coming to the table. After all, they had been through an intense battle earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We're all family, so there's no need to stand on ceremony with each other. However, I must still have a drink with Brother." Yin Sha lifted up his wine cup in Qing Shui's direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You’ve already said that we're brothers so there's no need to stand on ceremony. Come, let's drink up." Qing Shui smiled and picked up his wine cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I really don't know if you're the one who brings us great luck of if is our daughter that is." Feng Xi smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aunt Feng, it's not about us bringing you great fortune. We just have an affinity."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When people could not explain it well, they would believe that it was due to their affinity. &nbsp;Affinity is an inexplicable phenomenon between people. The affinity between husband and wife, the affinity in becoming friends, and amongst all the people in the world, their meetings and encounters, it was such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi wasn't an ordinary lady either. Although she could tell that Qing Shui was one who valued relationships, she had always been the one to receive his goodwill. The reason they could become so close as kin was because she had taken Tantai Lingyan as her goddaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan had been very lonely, but she wouldn't just let anyone take her in as their goddaughter. Feng Xi was very suitable. Qing Shui had also understood Feng Xi's intentions back then. Qing Shui and the others were not on the same standings in positions as they were before, so this event was also a form of repayment to her. Relationships were priceless and what that was most important was to let Tantai Lingyan feel a little bit more warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, the banquet lasted for about four hours. Qing Shui was still deciding on not making the first move and was just waiting for the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect to make the next attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the meal, Yin Sha and the others went back to rest. Feng Xi, Yin Sha, and Old Wang also left. This had not been the last battle, and the final outcome was still undecided. Therefore, they all treated every peaceful moment preciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pulled Tantai Lingyan away and left the place. As they were were husband and wife here there was nothing inappropriate about their actions. On the contrary, this made the others envious of this pair that they felt was a match made in heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, when do you think the people from the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect will come next?" Tantai Lingyan asked as shewalked with Qing Shui to the little place that belonged to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm not sure, but it will definitely not be in these few days. For now they'll need to reassess the Divine Moon Immortal Sect's abilities."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui said relaxed manner, as if he didn't take it to heart. &nbsp;It wasn’t that Qing Shui wasn’t worried, it was because everyone had placed their hopes on him. If he didn’t remain calm, it would be make the others all the more worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Qing Shui still had a little confidence in his abilities. The Paragon Strike was definitely a terrifying existence. Also now that he had the Diamond Staff, his Five Elements Divine Refining Technique was also very terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had his formations, the Battle God Halo, weakening abilities, and other skills. Even if the opponents were to be slightly stronger than himself, it'd still be fine. The other side would definitely not have that many Divinities who were exceptionally powerful. After all, the people who had came forth previously had already revealed a lot of things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the previous losses wouldn't deal a huge blow to the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect, it did deal some effect to them. Even though it might not be equivalent to breaking off one of their arms, it was more like they had lost half of an arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're always like this. It's as if you aren't scared of anything." Tantai Lingyan smiled and said. She liked this guy's confidence. The feeling of security which he gave was irreplaceable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who said so? I'm very scared of you." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
