 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2405 - Sacred Blue Immortal Grass, Head to the Demon Gate</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui followed the man into a very spacious hall with simple decor. There was a faint smell of medicine in the hall and there was a smaller hall within. The medicinal smell originated from the inner hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We'll have to trouble Mister Qing," The man said politely as they walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's fine. Let me take a look at the Palace Lord's condition first," Qing Shui replied, but kept thinking that the Palace Lord must have been injured by Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They entered the smaller hall, which wasn't really that small, just a lot smaller than the outer hall. There were several tens of people here who belonged to the Divine Palace. The Palace Lord's life was at its end and everyone was in deep grief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They saw the man walking in together with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Palace Lord Xiao, this person is...?" A lady walked over and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sister-in-law, this is Mister Qing. He is a physician and is also a Battle God like us. He might be able to save the Palace Lord," the man introduced Qing Shui to the married lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hello, we'll have to trouble you," the married lady said respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Madam, there's no need to stand on ceremony. Let me take a look at the Palace Lord's condition first." After saying that, Qing Shui walked up to the bed and took a look at the man on the bed. He appeared slightly old, at about his fifties. Right now, he was very pale and his vitals were very weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took his pulse and then used Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling. If no treatment was given, this person would not live past the next two days. He might even die at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His injuries were very serious and they were all infected. The inside of his body was seriously damaged from powerful attacks and ordinary physicians weren't be able to deal with them, even if they had powerful medicinal pills. It was because the vessel to absorb the medicinal effects was greatly damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how amazing the medicinal pills, even if they could grow one's flesh and bones or bring one back to life, they all had one condition. The person's head mustn't be separated from the body, the heart must still be intact, and the time of death mustn't exceed two hours. All of these meant that there were still certain conditions when absorbing miracle medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, why was it that some people would say that even the Great Firmament Golden Immortal [1] couldn't save them at the verge of their deaths? Those were situations like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Palace Lord's condition was that his internal body was seriously damaged, to the degree that it was unable to absorb any medicinal effects. Therefore, alchemists and physicians were unable to do anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was very quiet in the hall, so quiet that one could even hear a needle drop. The Palace Lord's life or death was very important to the Divine Palace. If the Palace Lord wasn't around, it'd be all over for the Divine Palace. They wouldn't be able to survive in the Forsaken Heaven City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long while, Qing Shui drew back his hand. The man on the bed woke up and when he saw the people in the room, he smiled. He was very weak, but Qing Shui's Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling could ensure that his life wasn't at risk for the next three days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Palace Lord, you're awake. How do you feel?" Palace Lord Xiao immediately said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people around also asked him about his condition agitatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm fine. I feel very good. Cough cough..." The Palace Lord was still wearing a smile, but he coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made the others panic once again. The married lady looked at Qing Shui, "Miraculous Physician, quick, take a look at Old Tang. Is he alright?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled and said, "I can cure him, but I need some time. I also need an additional medicinal herb."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Really? Go on, what do you need? I'll go look for it immediately." Palace Lord Xiao said quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sacred Blue Immortal Grass." Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is that? Where can it be found? What must I do to find it?" Palace Lord Xiao immediately raised all the questions everyone else had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Although this thing is very precious, it isn't that rare. Forsaken Heaven City's auction halls or some bigger medicinal halls should have them. However, it’s hard to say if you'll be able to buy them. It's very precious and not many people know how to utilize it. However, everyone knows that it's something precious. If you can offer good conditions, it shouldn't be hard to get." Qing Shui said after giving it some thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Qing Shui say that, everyone felt more assured. They immediately sent people out to search for the Sacred Blue Immortal Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason Qing Shui wanted the Sacred Blue Immortal Grass wasn't for treating the Palace Lord's injuries. With his medical skills and the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal's Flower of Life and Spring of Life, he would be able to treat him with relative ease. However, he still had to act as if he were doing something. Moreover, he happened to need the Sacred Blue Immortal Grass. It wasn't that much to ask as compensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then started to treat the Palace Lord, applying the Gold Needle Acupuncture. He first treated one of the Palace Lord's major internal organs. After doing so, he would be able to use the theory of mutual reinforcement to continue the treatment using the Five Elements Divine Needle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After bringing out a drop of the Spring of Life and dissolving a Flower of Life into it, he let the Palace Lord consume it. He then used his powerful vitality and Force of Rebirth to heal the Palace Lord's body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Qing Shui wasn't able to cure this condition instantly. He would still need some time to do so. It wasn't that he wasn't putting in his utmost effort. Even though his medical skills were extraordinary, he wasn't a god. Moreover, there were no gods in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a series of treatments, the Palace Lord's condition and mental state was clearly a lot better. Most importantly, he wasn't hurting as much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Palace Lord Tang!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, I'm called Tang Yude. You can just call me Old Tang," The man was very forthright and said to Qing Shui, who was preparing a prescription for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then I'll call you Brother Tang."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, alright. Brother, your medical skills are really amazing. There was an old physician who said that even an immortal wouldn't be able to cure me," Tang Yude exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You flatter me. Right, Brother, I want to find out about the situation you encountered back then," Qing Shui said casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sigh, the Divine Palace and the Demon Gate have been evenly matched all along. Although we've always had numerous small clashes, we've basically never had an all-out battle. Both parties are aware that we aren't able to destroy each other. However, a number of Demon Kings appeared one day and they are very powerful. They control the current Demon Gate and even the previous Sect Leader was willing to become their subordinate. They then brought people to the Divine Palace. In particular, she is very strong and is top notch in the Forsaken Heaven Region. I'm also at the maximum level, but I'm still a far cry from her. Her destructive power is very terrifying...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then why did she stop?" After hearing Tang Yude's words, Qing Shui knew that it wasn't impossible for Tantai Lingyan to wipe out the Divine Palace. However, after Tang Yude was seriously injured, she suddenly left with her people. Qing Shui was very curious why she did that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have no idea either. I only know that back then, she fell into a short daze when she saw the sword in her hands." Tang Yude tried to recall what happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui knew that the sword was something he had given her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui left the Divine Palace. He didn't need to see Tang Yude everyday, but it was still necessary for him to see him once every few days. After leaving the Divine Palace, Qing Shui headed straight for the Demon Gate. With his current capabilities, he wasn't afraid of anyone in the Forsaken Heaven City. He wanted to take a look at Tantai Lingyan. He must see her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Palace wasn't that close to the Demon Gate. However, it wasn't far by Qing Shui’s standards. Therefore, it didn't take him long before he arrived at the Demon Gate. The Demon Gate was also located on the Sky Mountain.</span></p>
