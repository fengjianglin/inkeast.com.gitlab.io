 <p><strong>AST 1213 - Heaven and Earth Battle Beast, Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Dragon Species Force</strong></p>
 <p>The Dragon Elephant Force has increased from the original ten folds to the present twenty folds. This was the true Dragon Elephant Force. Only this was able to match up to the nickname Heaven and Earth Battle Beast. As Qing Shui observed the current Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the elegant and ancient aura of it made him really excited. It somehow gave him a nervous feeling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt like laughing. Right now, merely the Dragon Elephant Force had already increased the strength of the dragon elephant up to four hundred thousand nimbus. If he has had this Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant previously, it would have been a piece of cake for him to kill that baby dragon. However, that baby dragon in a way was also considered to have helped him a lot.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t wait to check out the battle techniques of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Even the old battle techniques from before could help increase the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephants by a number of folds. If that was the case, just with its current strength, he was already able to instantly kill the fire baby dragon from before.</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant’s Recklessness, three folds of standard attacks. It could hit twenty targets at most.</p>
 <p>This still hadn’t changed. Despite so, Qing Shui smiled happily. The Dragon Elephant Force was the key, and that had increased by one whole fold. Even if the rest were to stay the same, Qing Shui would still feel quite happy about it. But merely the Mighty Dragon Elephant’s Recklessness already increased his strength up to a 1.2 million nimbus.</p>
 <p>1.2 million nimbus. Even though this was within Qing Shui’s expectations, he was still shocked by it. What kind of strength was this? He wasn’t really clear about it. Could this be considered as the strength of peak fourth grade State Masters?</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp, Great Perfection Stage. Ten folds of raw offensive strength. There was a fixed chance that it would cause the opponent to experience paralysis which as a result immobilize them.</p>
 <p>Other than it have a fixed chance of paralyzing opponent, it basically didn’t contain much wounding power. Furthermore, the chance of it paralyzing its opponent was very small as well.</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi: Instantaneously shot out Core Qi to attack opponents. It possesses powerful wounding power. It could decrease the opponent’s strength by twenty percent. The effect last for two hours.</p>
 <p>This battle technique would be useful in the future. Not only so, it was quite a decent offensive battle technique. More importantly, it carried the function to decrease opponent’s strength by twenty percent.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdue Demons: Once used, it would cause a lot of the targets within a thousand meters radius to experience decrease in strength as much as ten percent. The targets cannot exceed fifty people. This effect would last for two hours.</p>
 <p>In the past, due to the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant being not strong enough, it resulted in the very rare use of Vajra Subdue Demons. Now, things were just perfect, it could finally be used now. Unfortunately, it still only weaken opponent by one fold. Even so, when used together with Emperor’s Qi, it would definitely have heaven-defying results.</p>
 <p>A man who was never content was like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. This was precisely what Qing Shui felt he was at the moment.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion: Within five thousand meters, the dragon elephant could instantly jump off from one spot to another.</p>
 <p>This ability has gotten stronger by more than a fold.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack: Instantly trigger five folds of user’s original strength to attack a single target.</p>
 <p>This too didn’t change. This was one of the most powerful single kill attacks belonging to that of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. It was capable of increasing the strength up to 2 million nimbus in an instant. This was the biggest killer weapon for the dragon elephant, especially when it was used together with Instantaneous Diamond Evasion.</p>
 <p>Now, it’s already considered to be a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast. It’s born solely for the purpose of battling.</p>
 <p>Dark Infernal Flames: The dark flame below its legs enabled the attacks of the dragon elephant to have twenty percent chance of breaking armors. Simultaneously, it also increases the speed of the dragon elephant in the sky by one fold.</p>
 <p>Dragon Scale Armor: Passive battle technique, enable a significant increase in dragon elephant’s defense. The powerful body of the dragon elephant is its biggest ability.</p>
 <p>The last one turned into Dragon Scale Armor. It also turned into a passive Battle Technique. Even though the way it was described was almost the same as in the past, Qing Shui knew that its defensive ability had been raised enormously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui came back to his senses. The surprise he felt in his heart was indescribable. Now, merely the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant already made him felt a lot braver. The maximum strength he could draw out now was a hundred and seventy thousand nimbus. But now, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was able to draw out two million nimbus. Just how big was the difference in strength? Let alone the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had the Dragon Scale Armor… It was just too powerful.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui sensed something new within his Dantian, he stunned. He quickly took a peek into it. A grey pellet has appeared within his Dantian. Without much thought, Qing Shui could already tell that it was a feedback of strength given by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant due to the Divine Marionette.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thought up to this point, he stunned. This time, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant has increased its raw strength as much as around twenty thousand nimbus. It was a transformation in its nature. This was considered as a breakthrough for dragon species. Since that happened, how much of the feedback strength would he get?</p>
 <p>Two thousand nimbus? Or more?</p>
 <p>He could get an additional two thousand nimbus worth of raw strength? Qing Shui froze in shock. The impact he got from before which he got from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant got stopped by his current thought. Previously, his raw strength was worth forty nimbus…… If he achieved a strength worth two thousand nimbus, it would mean he has increased it by fifty folds.</p>
 <p>Previously, with the usage of Big Dipper Sword, he was able to achieve thirty thousand nimbus of strength. Under the circumstance when he met the twenty percent chance to double his attack prowess, it would worth sixty thousand nimbus. If his raw strength was to really increase by fifty times, that would mean he would have strength worth 1.5 million nimbus. If the condition for strength double was met, it would be around 3 million nimbus.</p>
 <p>What kind of concept is this? How strong is the eldest princess?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt both agitated as well as unbelievable being hit by all of these sudden news. It seemed like his Spirit Energy has become even stronger, particularly under the situation when he used the Seal of Rocs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped thinking. He calmed his mind. For now, he was thinking mainly about whether he should refine this terrifying strength. Would his body be able to cope against it? Or would it explode and as a result cause his death?</p>
 <p>The Violet Gold Bloodlines within his body has become a lot thicker. With his Nine Yang Golden Body at Large Success Stage, he didn’t know if he would be able to stand it. After all, the feedback of his strength this time was way too powerful. He would tremble every time he thought about increasing two thousand nimbus of his raw strength. It’s just that this would require him to add in the amplification of both his golden pellets and seven-colored pellets, which was why he was feeling so worried.</p>
 <p>Forget it, the current matter at hand was for him to first meet the girls. He would only ponder over this issue a bit later. Qing Shui gestured the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and stepped onto it. After that, he disappeared into the direction where the girls were.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui felt a lot more brave standing on top of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. This was precisely just as the theory said, a very able person would be very daring. The strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was equivalent to being his own strength. “The sky was high and broad for birds flying; the sea was wide and deep for fish swimming”, this was exactly the mindset he was having right now. He quickly proceeded into the direction where the Fire Bird went just now. Along the way, he would from time to time, use the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion.</p>
 <p>After flying for awhile, Qing Shui kept his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. He used the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring and flashed across the sky. For every one time he used it, he would travel a distance of two hundred Li. He continued on until he traveled about ten thousand Li. The remaining times he could use the ring has also been used up. However, Qing Shui was already able to sense the Fire Bird’s aura.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he seemed to have also sensed noises of people fighting.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got shocked. He increased the speed of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant all the way to its maximum.</p>
 <p>“Surround them. I am interested to see how the people from Breezing Wind Veranda are going to try to run away. Since you are here, don’t blame us for not showing any politeness. If you want to blame, blame yourself for sticking with Breezing Wind Veranda.”</p>
 <p>A rough voice could be heard faintly.</p>
 <p>“You guys are harming people from your own academy. Are you not afraid of getting punished by Heaven Secrets Academy?” A bold and powerful voice came through. It sounded loud and clear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled. It’s very likely that they’re together with other people from Breezing Wind Veranda.</p>
 <p>“Haha, foolish. The Heaven Secrets Academy were too busy to intervene with small issues like this. Let me repeat one more time, join the Saint Child Band. Or else, the outcome today will be beyond your expectations. Don’t say that I haven’t made myself clear enough.” The rough voice from before sounded a bit arrogant.</p>
 <p>“Do you guys not fear that the Breezing Wind Veranda might come back and seek revenge from you guys?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, this is funny, even Yu Sunu, the leader of Breezing Wind Veranda is unable to break free from the grasp of our Saint Child. Aren’t you aware that the Saint Child is after Yu Sunu? Be obedient and join us. This way, we will be able to maintain a good image with each other. If it isn’t because these girls look pretty, do you really think that it will be that easy for you guys to join Saint Child Band?” A soft voice came through.</p>
 <p>By now, Qing Shui has already arrived. Standing on top of the mighty Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, he was able to observe the situation down below. The girls as well as a few other ten people were being surrounded by a large group consisting of around four hundred men. They weren’t actually the people associated with Prince Fu from before.</p>
 <p>Judging by their conversation which Qing Shui overheard from before, he was able to tell that they should be people from Saint Child Band as well as Breezing Wind Veranda respectively. Or rather, it could also be said to be the problems between the eldest princess and the person known as Saint Child. It’s very likely that they purposely treated people from the Breezing Wind Veranda this way to put pressure on the eldest princess.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized that the three girls were fine. It’s just that around them, there were a few people who were injured. It’s very likely that they have only just started fighting. They have yet to go all out, which meant they were just demonstrating their strength. With this being the case, Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a huge demonic beast appeared in mid-air. Furthermore, it was a beast which looked unusually malevolent and fierce. Its dragon head in particular, caused the people from below to feel a bit shocked.</p>
 <p>But upon seeing the body of the demonic beast, they stopped fearing it as much. After all, it only carried a bit of dragon bloodlines. It wasn’t an actual dragon. There were a lot of demonic beasts which contained features of dragons. Other than their looks, their strength wasn’t as powerful.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don’t come near us. Leave quickly.” The seventh princess screamed loudly from below.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui didn’t see it as an issue. He gradually dropped down near the girls. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant on the other hand, it remained in the sky.</p>
 <p>“Yet another one here trying to dig his own grave…. I am just going to say this one more time, join us Saint Child Band. Young Master Du will serve you well.” A gentle and reserved voice came through.</p>
 <p>“Let us go. I will pretend like nothing happened today.” Qing Shui was looking at the man standing at the heart of the area. The man wore luxurious costumes. Certainly, he had an impressive presence. It’s just his eyes…... Both of his eyes looked perverted. Around him, there were also two flirtatious women but their level of beauty could only be considered decent.</p>
 <p>“Who do you think you are? You want me to let you guys go? Du Xing, kill him. Does he really think that he is invincible just because he owns a giant demonic beast?” The man’s voice was heard. He sounded arrogant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got startled and smiled. He observed the old man who was slowly approaching him before proceeding to do the same to the surroundings. It’s very likely that the man with the name Young Master Du held quite a decent position in the Saint Child Band. He would at least be an elite disciple or if not, a core disciple. There were quite a lot of core disciples within the Heaven Secrets Academy. The reason being that the actual powerhouse of the Heaven Secrets Academy were their core disciples. As for the normal, high grade as well as elite disciples which came in the biggest quantity, they belonged to the most bottom part of Heaven Secrets Academy. They were regarded as hopes of the academy. The reason being that core disciples as well as future masters all started off from said positions. There would come a day when they would encounter the same obstacles just to ascend to core disciples.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui had come to this place in the past, it’s very likely that he wouldn’t have been able to change anything. But now, in his eyes, these people were just equivalent to a group of mole cricket and ants.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, you are courting death. Don’t blame me for it.”</p>
 <p>As the old man finished speaking, he immediately charged towards Qing Shui. He totally ignored the people in the surroundings and saw them as nothing.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Seal of Roc!</p>
 <p>Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t bear to see people acting tough. The old man thought of Qing Shui as someone who could be bullied easily. Watching as the old man charging towards him, without any hesitation, Qing Shui instantly performed his strongest techniques.</p>
 <p>Almost immediately, an enormous golden roc appeared once again, Qing Shui smiled at the old man and activated his consciousness.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>Actually, the elderly man was significantly stronger than Qing Shui in terms of strength. But because he overestimated himself, he didn’t even use his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. Added on that he was further weakened by Qing Shui’s techniques, eventually, despite his utmost effort to defend himself, it has already been decided that he would suffer a tragic end.</p>
 <p>The old man right away spurted out fresh blood and got blown into the distance. As this happened, everyone around the scene got stunned. The old man has now lost his consciousness. It’s unknown whether he was still alive. But even if he did manage to survive, he would most likely be half-dead.</p>
