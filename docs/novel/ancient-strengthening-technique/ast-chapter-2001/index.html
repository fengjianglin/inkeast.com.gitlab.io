 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A beam of golden light flashed and the Paragon Golden Armor appeared. Qing Shui was very shocked. It was because when that flying sword came piercing toward him again, its speed was too fast. There would be no more Paragon Golden Armor next time. Qing Shui felt anxious. However, he quickly thought of his Heavenly Vision Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly Vision Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This slowed down the speed of the flying sword by a lot, but it was still very fast. However, he could now see it clearly and could dodge it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui attempted to use the Art of Pursuing on the flying sword, but hadn't expected to succeed. It wouldn't be a threat to him anymore. Qing Shui couldn't even be bothered to use the formations and the Emperor's Qi. Qing Shui once again used the Golden Battle Halberd to fend off the flying sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui already knew about the flying sword. The old man's face was extremely pale now. Qing Shui knew that the sword of the old man couldn't be considered as a flying sword, but was just a skill that was similar to it. The old man's mastery of the skill was clearly insufficient and if he was to forcibly use it, there would be a backlash and the old man could end up being crippled. He could even lose his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prowess of the flying sword was huge, but the depletion was also tremendous. This was why the old man had almost depleted a large part of his Origin Qi when he had only used it for such a short while. He had only launched three attacks so far, and would probably be able to use it for three more times at most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if he won't be crippled after using it, the skill could be considered as a great killing technique. Qing Shui's speed and spiritual sense were already considered to be very powerful. However, the flying sword's speed was so fast that he didn't have the time to dodge. Thankfully, he still had his Heavenly Vision Technique. Otherwise, he would have to depend on the Nine Continents Mountain and the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had no idea if the Dragon Slaying Beast could fend off the sharpness of this flying sword. Qing Shui had the feeling that it should be able to, but he couldn't be sure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing this flying sword's ability, Qing Shui felt like forging his own flying sword. If he were to forge his own flying sword, it would be much more powerful than the old man's. Plus, he would be able to fly while standing on the sword. Doing so would allow him to fly much faster than if he were to fly himself. It was said that flying while standing on the sword wouldn't deplete Origin Qi at a very fast rate and one could continue doing so for very long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui wasn't sure about these things. He had only thought about them. After all, if the depletion of energy for flying on swords was so great, then one would only be able to fly for a very short distance. It would lose its effect since one might as well choose not to fly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used his Golden Battle Halberd to block two more times. He kept being pushed back or sent flying. This showed how powerful the flying sword was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prowess of the flying sword wasn't its strength, but its prowess and penetrating force. If it wasn't because of the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand, he would have been pierced through a long time ago. The flying sword was no longer considered as an ordinary weapon. Even Divine Weapons would clearly be worse off when compared to the flying sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like the difference between ordinary items and spiritual items</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the old man's flying sword could only be considered as an ordinary item. Despite so, it was of a Divine grade and wouldn't lose out to Qing Shui's Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the thought of this, Qing Shui increasingly hoped that he would be able to forge his own flying sword as soon as possible. When that was to happen, his battle prowess could probably increase by several notches, being able to kill his opponents from a far distance with great ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flying sword shattered and the old man spurted out a mouthful of blood, falling down limp onto the ground. He looked at Qing Shui, "Give them a way out."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that the old man wouldn't be able to survive. He looked at him calmly and said, "Everyone here has to die. The rest of the people from your Sacred Medicine Palace can leave."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui won't eliminate them completely from the roots. The Sacred Medicine Palace was a great sect with many people. It would be very difficult even if he wished to kill all of them completely. Moreover, Qing Shui didn't want to cause a massacre. He had the Buddha Light Treasure Qi in his body. It was an invisible power of Buddhism, and it was important in Buddhism to be benevolent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had five disciples and 30 grand disciples. They were practically a goner. Some people deserved to be killed. The old man could say extremely shameless things before these people, which showed that they were his trusty aides. There was a saying ‘when the leader sets a bad example, his subordinates would follow.’ Qing Shui could sense from Qiu Di, Hong Chen, and many other people here that their kidneys weren't doing well. Although they had been taking nutritious medicines, the damage was still very high. This showed that these people had indulged in sex too much. This was not only it. Qing Shui had also seen the greed in some of these people's eyes when they saw Qing Ci.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since they wanted to snatch something that belonged to him, Qing Shui decided to go along with the idea of not wasting things and swept off some of the things present, such as interspatial silk sachets, and tossed them into his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He then brought Qing Ci and Little Mo, and walked towards the interior of the Sacred Medicine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast hadn't lost its treasure-searching ability at all and led Qing Shui directly to the Sacred Medicine Palace's treasure chamber. Qing Shui was shown a great sect's collections and treasures. This was the Sacred Medicine Palace and most of the things collected was actually medicinal herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then there were metals, otherworldly meteorites, as well as some strange and unknown things, including a treasure pagoda. Qing Shui found yet another treasure pagoda. Although this thing might look good and amazing to ordinary people, having a hint of dignified aura. They wouldn't know how to use them. Even then, they could not bear to throw them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a brief look. There weren't much of them--three treasure pagodas. One of them was the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda of Violence. It could double one's attacking prowess within a certain success rate. It wasn't stated what the success rate was, but it shouldn't be too high. However, it shouldn't be too low either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two were the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda and the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda of Defence. The latter would increase the user's personal overall defense abilities by 20%.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kept them. He was quite satisfied with them. Such things were useful in training the body, especially in building his resistance of attack. If one's defense was too low, the effect wouldn't be much. However, no one in this world would detest the thought of getting stronger. Following on, Qing Shui didn't use them immediately since he knew that the treasure pagodas had a limit. He had already used two of them and wasn't sure if he could still use more. In his memories as a Battle God Inheritor, there was something similar to the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda and a person could only use five of them. And this was the case when one's cultivation had reached the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he reckoned that he should be able to use three or even four of them. However, it was unlikely for him to be able to use five of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to find some which were practical for him. When his flying sword is out, he might get himself one of those vitality treasure pagodas. Although his endurance and recovery abilities were both very strong, no one would detest the thought of getting stronger. Therefore, he would put this aside for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the right decision for him to come to the Sacred Medicine Palace's hidden treasure chamber. He managed to gather a lot of medicinal herbs and they were those which had aged well. Moreover, there were some of them which he needed now. There were even some seeds for medicines which had very high requirements in order to be used. They were placed here since the requirements couldn't be met.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmmm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Star Iron！</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked agitatedly at a piece of pale blue metal. He thought of the old man's sword. This was an indispensable material to forge a flying sword and Qing Shui hadn't expected to find it here. Moreover, that old man's sword had this Divine Star Iron added in.</span></p>
