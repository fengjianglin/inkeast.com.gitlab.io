However, since the Demon King Inheritance appeared mostly in water, I’ve never had any contacts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Before my arrival to the Haohan Continent, I had met some of them whose might were strong. They weren’t even in the deep sea.” Qing Shui thought of the Vicious Shark Palace, the Sea Dragon Palace, the Sunset Palace, and even the Ancient Battle King Crab in the Sunset Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;"Have you heard of the existence of the Immortal Sect in the Haohan Continent?" Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui with a trace of hope in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An inexplicable feeling surged in Qing Shui’s heart. As expected, she still couldn’t let go of the Five Tigers Immortal Sect. Although Qing Shui knew that this would be the case, he still felt the heavy burden on his shoulders at the confirmation. He couldn’t just turn a blind eye to her affairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a soft sigh, he replied. "Before I came back, I came across someone from the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. They were a couple. The man had been in a coma for more than ten years from a case of poisoning. When I go back again, I would probably be able to heal him drastically."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching the expression behind Qing Shui’s eyes, Tantai Lingyan knew what he was thinking. At the very least, she could make an accurate guess. With a smile, she shook her head. “I know what you’re thinking. There’s no need to feel pressurized. I’m not going to die in vain. I have already waited for so many years. I won’t go if I don’t have the might to do so."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan in surprise. “Oh, the lass is capable of taking others into consideration too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan donned a peculiar look as she regarded Qing Shui. "You’re not allowed to call me lass. Why is an ignorant young rascal like you acting like an elder?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. Looked at her with a trace of pleasantness, the cloud in his heart seemed to have cleared as well. With just her smile, he didn’t seem to care about anything else anymore. The idea rendered Qing Shui still, unable to gather himself for a moment. Was she really so important to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan, who had never reacted strongly before. "Maybe should I call you Aunt Yan instead?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was taken aback for a second before huffing in anger. "I don’t want such an old nephew like you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled happily when he saw Tantai Lingyan’s reaction. "I don't know how old you are. I just feel that you are at the very most, an immortal."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan gazed at the rascal in front of her and her heart became surprisingly calm. In fact, she hadn’t truly been angry before. When she was with him, she had always felt serene, as if everything would be okay. As long as he was there, they could withstand anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright. Once we settle the matter here, I would like to take a trip to the Haohan Continent as well and take a look for myself." Tantai Lingyan said seriously and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Can't bear for me to leave?" Qing Shui said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wouldn’t have dared to do that in the past but he realized there was a peculiar connection between them now and he could feel the hatred she once bore towards him dwindling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you aren’t willing, I'll go on my own!” Even though Tantai Lingyan's expression was calm, Qing Shui was delighted with the tone she used. There was a hint of emotional turbulence in her speech like she was saying it out of spite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why wouldn't I be willing? It’s all I could ever wish for. Lingyan, what will happen to Demon Lord Palace if you leave?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan has been immunized by the names Qing Shui had used to address her. Whatever way he wished to address her was fine by her. Without second thoughts, she replied, “Demon Lord Palace will be fine. Nothing will happen with Rumei around. Plus, there the elders and others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only halfway through the afternoon when Qing Shui proposed, "I want to strengthen your Origin Qi."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan couldn’t keep a calm composure at the thought of their previous encounter. She blushed as she watched at Qing Shui’s earnest gaze. Without knowing what to say, she nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last time was for him to get through her acupoint. This time it was to strengthen her Origin Qi. There was no need to strip bare but it was necessary to take off her outerwear, leaving her in a thin layer of pajamas. It would be best to have her hands and feet exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan changed into a set of pajamas, reminding Qing Shui of the scenario when he saw her for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyes were closed and her hair in a bun. Her brows soft, her face had no makeup, but yet had a tinge of red on her fair skin. She was unbelievably beautiful and looked as though she was asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her snow white clothes could not hide the curves of her body. She had thin shoulders with the curves of her bosom capable of making one’s heart race. Her waist looked incredibly slender. Her delicate body was like a jade sculpture made by God, her exposed legs had a sparkling luster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even as she laid there with her eyes closed, she still exuded a temperament that others dare not profane. She was the most unapproachable woman Qing Shui had ever seen. Not because of her coldness but the pride and loftiness that was within her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that she was standing in front of him, the impact was even greater. Qing Shui could not conceal his admiration. With a shake of his head, he spoke with a smile. "Sister Yan, you must not blame me for my ill manners. It’ll be more pathetic if I don’t. I’m a man after all…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you trying to imply that I’m at fault then?" Tantai Lingyan had a small smile to her, her words spoken without a hint of displeasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Beauty is the cause of trouble for a country in peril. Sister, I think you’re even better than all of these. A smile of yours would be enough to overturn a city. If you desire to extinguish a dynasty, all you have to do is to flash your smile at them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can’t tell if that’s a compliment or a scolding." Tantai Lingyan sat down beside Qing Shui and his heart raced in reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How could I scold you? I wouldn’t dare to, nor would I bear to." Qing Shui seized the chance when their atmosphere felt that slight bit flirtatious and Tantai Lingyan didn’t seem as indifferent as she was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stretched out his hand and held hers. When she tried to retract, his finger pressed against her veins and Tantai Lingyan stopped her attempt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah, how great it was to be a physician</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, Qing Shui thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood of Demon Lord was already abundant in Tantai Lingyan's body but it was pure in essence. Qing Shui had come across several successors of Demon King Inheritance but believed that the blood in those people's body was not even half as pure as Tantai Lingyan’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui discerned if that was good or bad news. Her bare hands were warm and gentle as jade. It touched his heart in an inexplicable manner as his hand covered hers. After a long time, Qing Shui raised his head and gently retracted his hand. “Your strength is really strong now. Your realm has caught up as well, and your foundation is stable."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do I still have to strengthen my Origin Qi then?” Tantai Lingyan asked in haste.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes, because you’ve had two breakthroughs in a row. Although your foundation is good, it is like a pavilion. If it grew twice in height abruptly, the burden on its foundation would likewise increase drastically. Without strengthening it, the stability of this pavilion will suffer immensely." Qing Shui explained with a metaphor that was easy to understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could sense Tantai Lingyan's dilemma. "Don’t worry, you won't have to take off your pajamas."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sentence made Tantai Lingyan flush a deeper red. Still, she was relieved to hear his words. If she had to take off her clothes, she didn’t know if she could accept it. Maybe not, but this terrible man would definitely to give her a reason to sway her. Without conscious awareness, she had realized that she had stopped discriminating against him as much as she used to. When did that happen? Was it the moment of their reunion?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll throw you out if you continue spouting nonsense." Tantai Lingyan snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words were a pleasure to Qing Shui’s ears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had Tantai Lingyan lie on the bed. With the white quilt on the white bed, it looked both seductive and soft. The way Tantai Lingyan laid on it shyly complimented the bed. It was a perfection beyond words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was more perfect was her beautiful curves. They were incomparably perfect without a hint of exaggeration. Her white pajamas were a little loose, giving her a languid look. She lost a bit of her usual coldness with her eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's hands rested on her shoulders and felt her body tensing up. He smiled. "Don't be nervous. Although I am not the most upright gentleman, I wouldn’t take advantage of you either. If I like anyone, I would woo them openly."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's body relaxed at his voice and Qing Shui's hand began to apply pressure. Qing Shui used a special technique when strengthening Origin Qi to instigate her body's activity. It was like stimulating the body cells so that he could do more with less and the medicine could be absorbed effectively as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This technique was in no way inferior to the Soft-Tendon Hand Technique, nor did it feel any less satisfying in comparison to the joy between men and women. Qing Shui really had no other motives. When he was with Huoyun Liu-Li, she had always liked this method of Qing Shui’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan bit her lip and felt the heat from his hands seeping into her body. It numbed wherever he touched, reaching deep into her body. She held herself back from making any sound. At some point, she had buried her face into the bedding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's hand slowly slid down her back until it reached between the waist and hip. The arc there held a fatal attraction. When Qing Shui's hand touched Tantai Lingyan's waistline, he felt Tantai Lingyan's body tensing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By logic, her body shouldn’t have been this tense by this time and he would soon realize that she had underestimated his technique. He didn’t know that the waistline was a sensitive point for this woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's body trembled a little which caused Qing Shui to feel hot all over. Still, he pretended that he didn’t realize anything, skipping past her nice buttocks with great determination and working his way down her slender legs, towards her jade feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The foot was the reflex zone on a human body. Thus, it could not be skipped. This was the second time. The small and exquisite lines of the jade feet were soft and exuded the general luster of jade. Qing Shui could never have imagined that a pair of feet could be this beautiful in his past life. The sole of it was as delicate as white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He started on the acupuncture after. They were a lot quicker this time around and was done by the darkening of the sky; their result was still surprisingly good. Even Qing Shui was a little shocked but he knew now that Tantai Lingyan was embarrassed. In understanding, he covered her up with the quilt before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui's departure, Tantai Lingyan lifted her head. Those indifferent eyes were no longer cold. Instead, they were filled with a hint of gentleness, her face blushing from their contact. If Qing Shui were here to witness this, would he be able to control himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan covered her face with both hands and ran into the bathroom. Her pajamas were now drenched with sweat, and before she had actually...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She couldn't believe that it had happened in front of him and she wasn’t sure if Qing Shui had seen through it. Still, she felt that that rascal must have known. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have left so fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the thought of that, she smiled. He was still a considerate person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After showering, she felt relaxed all over and exceptionally satisfied. It was an indescribable feeling. At that moment, she felt as though her soul was about to leave her own body…</span></p>
