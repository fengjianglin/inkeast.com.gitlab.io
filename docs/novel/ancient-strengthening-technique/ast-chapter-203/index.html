  <p><strong>AST 203 A Beauty Helping to Massage</strong></p>
  <p>“Master, can we really do this?” Huoyun Liu-Li grabbed onto Canghai Mingyue’s arm and asked as she secretly sneaked a glance at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“When did Master ever lie to you before? Master didn’t tell you before, but my home is actually in Greencloud Continent. You are, after all, my only disciple, so I can also take the chance and bring you home to introduce you.” Cang Hai Ming Yue smiled warmly and said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was speechless as he was simply left out. “This lady’s obstinance is not at an ordinary level. I wonder if she’d still be so headstrong when she’s in bed with a man.” Qing Shui thought about it evilly while feeling jealous of the man whom she would be with.</p>
  <p>“Are there a lot of people in Master’s family?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked apprehensively!</p>
  <p>Seeing how nervous Huoyun Liu-Li was, Canghai Mingyue’s sexy red lips could not help but perked up into a light smile. Even Qing Shui, who had met a lady like Yiye Jiange, could not help but be in a daze as he stared at the peerless beauty.</p>
  <p>“I’m the only child in the family and there are only three of us, myself and my parents. They are very nice people and would definitely like you when they meet you.” Canghai Mingyue smiled and said.</p>
  <p>Each smile and each frown from this lady would lead others to her rhythm and even affect others’ emotions. When one saw her smile, one would uncontrollably smile; when one saw that she was happy, one would feel happy as well. When one saw that she was sad, one would feel sad as well…</p>
  <p>This master-disciple pair was the best. Qing Shui had already thought that Huoyun Liu-Li was an extremely intoxicating demoness. After seeing this lady who was comparable to someone mentioned in the history of his previous life who could destroy the country and cause sufferings to the people, he realised that she was the great demoness while Huoyun Liu-Li could only be considered a small demoness of low cultivation.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, let us leave together tomorrow!” Huoyun Liu-Li said as she turned her gaze, although she seemed to be slightly avoiding Qing Shui’s gaze.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue looked at this disciple of hers who had an extremely well disposition and look. She never thought that she would sink so quickly into the feelings of love and yet was unaware of it herself. It was just that this fellow was a bit strange. To think that she was not able to assess his level of cultivation. He should be young, very young!</p>
  <p>“Alright, but what are your plans for this Earthly Paradise?” Qing Shui smiled gently and asked.</p>
  <p>“Anyways, no one in Cang Lang Country would dare to court trouble here, so I can just leave it to Yanxue. Maybe I’ll be back after a while.”</p>
  <p>“You two can continue to chat. I will go have a rest!” Canghai Mingyue looked at Huoyun Liu-Li warmly and said before she turned and headed for Huoyun Liu-Li’s room. Her loosely fitted black coat made her back view seem like the queen or sovereign of the night.</p>
  <p>“So, she is your Master.” Qing Shui recovered his intoxicated gaze and looked towards Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p>“Why, have you met my Master before?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
  <p>“I’ve had a glance of her on the first day I came to Cang Lang Country. She was standing on the back of a Golden Winged Thunder Condor. I only felt that she was very strong, but would never have guessed that she is your Master and the strongest person in Cang Lang Country. Seeing how it is, it seems like she can’t be considered as someone from the Cang Lang Country.” Qing Shui said.</p>
  <p>“I think my Master can be considered as one who belongs to the rank of the deities. I’ve never seen any woman more beautiful than her.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled charmingly and looked at Qing Shui, her words unable to hide the pride and respect she had for her Master.</p>
  <p>“You’re not bad yourself, so don’t lower the standards for yourself. There are actually many factors in deciding whether one is beautiful or not. It also depends on the individual perspective.” Qing Shui laughed and said.</p>
  <p>When Huoyun Liu-Li heard Qing Shui’s words, she felt very happy but still lowered her head slightly in embarrassment. “Qing Shui, is there something you need to attend to in Greencloud Continent?”</p>
  <p>“No, I just want to go and take a look, and to see the world out there. Don’t they always say read a thousand book and walk a thousand li. It’s good to go out more.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Then, do you have any plans when you reach Greencloud Continent?” Huoyun Liu-Li grabbed Qing Shui’s sleeves and headed upstairs towards the highest level.</p>
  <p>“I don’t. I just want to venture around. Maybe I’ll get lucky by suddenly attaining the legendary Divine state of cultivation. I will stand above everyone else with beauties in my arms while I enjoy my life…”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui’s joke in amusement but eventually could not control her laughter. “Why is it that when you attain power, you must have beauties in your arms? Are beauties just accessories for those who have attained power?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said, “It’s an inside phrase of a younger brother back at home. I’m just borrowing it for use.” Qing Shui smiled awkwardly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s expression caused Huoyun Liu-Li to break into a charming and intoxicating laughter. When Qing Shui heard it, he had the urge to hug her close and squeeze her well-embodied figure.</p>
  <p>When they got to the rooftop, the winter afternoon’s sun that shone down was not only pretty, but also heartwarming. Only half of the rooftop was not sheltered, while the other half was tented by specialized wooden planks with a sofa and a bed below. It was very suitable for one to stay in the shade and enjoy the sun in both the summer and winter.</p>
  <p>Standing atop of the side of the rooftop allowed them to have a good view. They were able to see the scenes nearby and even the far yet blurry mountainous view. Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li who was standing quietly besides him, “What are your plans when you go to Greencloud Continent? I may run about everywhere, so will you be following your Master?”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was stunned for a moment before she lowered her head and said softly, “Do you not like me following you or are you afraid that I would be?”</p>
  <p>“I’m worried that it’ll be exhausting for you. I can’t bear to put a delicate beauty like you through all that.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p>“I’m also a Xiantian. Don’t put me in the same light as those frail women. I can even take care of you if I’m at your side.” Huoyun Liu-Li said shyly.</p>
  <p>“Can you cook?” Qing Shui smiled and said seriously.</p>
  <p>“No!” Huoyun Liu-Li answered embarrassedly. If it were not for the Drunken Fragrance Fruit, the food that she made would not be edible.</p>
  <p>“Can you do the laundry?”</p>
  <p>“I can learn.” Her voice went even softer!</p>
  <p>“Then what do you know? Come share with me. I’m very curious how a great beauty like you can take care of people. I’d like to know.” Qing Shui looked at the embarrassed Huoyun Liu-Li and said.</p>
  <p>“I know how to massage…” After saying this, she felt stunned. Qing Shui fell into a daze as well…</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li had recalled the other time when Qing Shui was massaging her. How could she think of doing it better than he did? At the same time, she also thought of that striking scene and was stunned as she fell into a panic.</p>
  <p>“Oh, massage is good. I’ve not tried it before. How do you know how to give massages?” When Qing Shui regained his sense, he smiled and said, looking at Huoyun Liu-Li with hopeful eyes.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li lifted her flushed red face and said, “Master and I used to give each other massages often in the past, so it should still be acceptable. It’s just that it’s a far cry from your techniques the…the other day.”</p>
  <p>“It’s fine, or shall we give it a try?” Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li “yearningly” and said.</p>
  <p>“Mmm!” Huoyun Liu-Li gave a straightforward reply.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go over there!” Huoyun Liu-Li tugged Qing Shui’s sleeves and headed for the nearby bed. It was also a bed with purple sheets and blankets.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Huoyun Liu-Li who was putting up a front before he laid face down on the bed, stretching out his arms and legs!</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li clenched her teeth and sat by the bed. She slowly reached with her slender, trembling hands towards Qing Shui’s shoulders and gently massaged him.</p>
  <p>When her hands just reached Qing Shui’s shoulder, he could not help but feel like crying out. It was the first time he enjoyed such treatment, especially by an unparalleled beauty.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-LI’s hands came into contact with Qing Shui’s body. While it was over a layer of clothes, it still felt warm to touch and she could smell the refreshing scent of a man which made her feel unsettled. She had never known that a man’s presence could be so strong that it made her extremely unsettled.</p>
  <p>The slender hands started from the shoulders and moved to the back. She was pressing, squeezing, kneading, and pinching, which caused Qing Shui to feel extremely comfortable. Feeling pressure on various acupuncture points on his back, he did not know if she knew them or had chanced upon them, especially the myriad pressure points along his spine.</p>
  <p>According to the Chinese medical practices, massage helps through various means by agitating the points including the skin, muscles, joints and nerves, vessels, and the lymph glands. It also helps to improve the blood circulation and metabolism rate. It would thus improve the body’s resistance, reduce inflammation, relieves muscles aches and pain. Massage relaxes the veins and channels, releases blood clots, reduces pain and swelling, and is advantageous to various illnesses. Qing Shui’s “Softboned Hands” brought this theory to greater heights with the application of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt so comfortable that he felt like falling asleep, but could not bear to do so. He felt those slender hands lightly pressing on his waist with a demonic energy, gently kneading and pressing.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s breath grew heavy but what he did not know was that Huoyun Liu-Li was at a loss. It was because if she were to continue downwards, it would be his…</p>
  <p>Recalling the other time, this rascal actually had his way with her butt, but it seemed very comfortable. The feeling of the pounding heart and the blankness of the mind felt as if he jumped into the deep abyss from mid-air.</p>
  <p>Gritting her teeth, Huoyun Liu-Li placed her hands on Qing Shui’s butt and grasped it lightly. Qing Shui let out a lewd cry of comfort.</p>
  <p>That sound made Huoyun Liu-Li flush red and she withdraw her hands after a round of grabbing his butt. Her skin was so thin that even her neck was covered with a layer of pink, causing Qing Shui to salivate.</p>

Only half of the rooftop was not sheltered, while the other half was tented by specialized wooden planks with a sofa and a bed below. It was very suitable for one to stay in the shade and enjoy the sun in both the summer and winter.</p>
 <p>Standing atop of the side of the rooftop allowed them to have a good view. They were able to see the scenes nearby and even the far yet blurry mountainous view. Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li who was standing quietly besides him, “What are your plans when you go to Greencloud Continent? I may run about everywhere, so will you be following your Master?”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was stunned for a moment before she lowered her head and said softly, “Do you not like me following you or are you afraid that I would be?”</p>
 <p>“I’m worried that it’ll be exhausting for you. I can’t bear to put a delicate beauty like you through all that.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>“I’m also a Xiantian. Don’t put me in the same light as those frail women. I can even take care of you if I’m at your side.” Huoyun Liu-Li said shyly.</p>
 <p>“Can you cook?” Qing Shui smiled and said seriously.</p>
 <p>“No!” Huoyun Liu-Li answered embarrassedly. If it were not for the Drunken Fragrance Fruit, the food that she made would not be edible.</p>
 <p>“Can you do the laundry?”</p>
 <p>“I can learn.” Her voice went even softer!</p>
 <p>“Then what do you know? Come share with me. I’m very curious how a great beauty like you can take care of people. I’d like to know.” Qing Shui looked at the embarrassed Huoyun Liu-Li and said.</p>
 <p>“I know how to massage…” After saying this, she felt stunned. Qing Shui fell into a daze as well…</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li had recalled the other time when Qing Shui was massaging her. How could she think of doing it better than he did? At the same time, she also thought of that striking scene and was stunned as she fell into a panic.</p>
 <p>“Oh, massage is good. I’ve not tried it before. How do you know how to give massages?” When Qing Shui regained his sense, he smiled and said, looking at Huoyun Liu-Li with hopeful eyes.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li lifted her flushed red face and said, “Master and I used to give each other massages often in the past, so it should still be acceptable. It’s just that it’s a far cry from your techniques the…the other day.”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, or shall we give it a try?” Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li “yearningly” and said.</p>
 <p>“Mmm!” Huoyun Liu-Li gave a straightforward reply.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go over there!” Huoyun Liu-Li tugged Qing Shui’s sleeves and headed for the nearby bed. It was also a bed with purple sheets and blankets.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Huoyun Liu-Li who was putting up a front before he laid face down on the bed, stretching out his arms and legs!</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li clenched her teeth and sat by the bed. She slowly reached with her slender, trembling hands towards Qing Shui’s shoulders and gently massaged him.</p>
 <p>When her hands just reached Qing Shui’s shoulder, he could not help but feel like crying out. It was the first time he enjoyed such treatment, especially by an unparalleled beauty.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-LI’s hands came into contact with Qing Shui’s body. While it was over a layer of clothes, it still felt warm to touch and she could smell the refreshing scent of a man which made her feel unsettled. She had never known that a man’s presence could be so strong that it made her extremely unsettled.</p>
 <p>The slender hands started from the shoulders and moved to the back. She was pressing, squeezing, kneading, and pinching, which caused Qing Shui to feel extremely comfortable. Feeling pressure on various acupuncture points on his back, he did not know if she knew them or had chanced upon them, especially the myriad pressure points along his spine.</p>
 <p>According to the Chinese medical practices, massage helps through various means by agitating the points including the skin, muscles, joints and nerves, vessels, and the lymph glands. It also helps to improve the blood circulation and metabolism rate. It would thus improve the body’s resistance, reduce inflammation, relieves muscles aches and pain. Massage relaxes the veins and channels, releases blood clots, reduces pain and swelling, and is advantageous to various illnesses. Qing Shui’s “Softboned Hands” brought this theory to greater heights with the application of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt so comfortable that he felt like falling asleep, but could not bear to do so. He felt those slender hands lightly pressing on his waist with a demonic energy, gently kneading and pressing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s breath grew heavy but what he did not know was that Huoyun Liu-Li was at a loss. It was because if she were to continue downwards, it would be his…</p>
 <p>Recalling the other time, this rascal actually had his way with her butt, but it seemed very comfortable. The feeling of the pounding heart and the blankness of the mind felt as if he jumped into the deep abyss from mid-air.</p>
 <p>Gritting her teeth, Huoyun Liu-Li placed her hands on Qing Shui’s butt and grasped it lightly. Qing Shui let out a lewd cry of comfort.</p>
 <p>That sound made Huoyun Liu-Li flush red and she withdraw her hands after a round of grabbing his butt. Her skin was so thin that even her neck was covered with a layer of pink, causing Qing Shui to salivate.</p>
