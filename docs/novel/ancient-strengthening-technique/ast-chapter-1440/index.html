Even though Qing Shui didn’t know what the reason for the old man’s decision was - that reason was known as ‘fate’ - he now felt that the reason wasn’t as simple as fate itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You and your father look alike.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, his mother’s words echoed in his ears. It would go well if this old man wasn’t associated with the Soaring Dragon Organization. That would be lucky. However, this old man is currently the Supreme Custodian of the Soaring Dragon Organization - a powerful individual. Things would not go as simple as he previously thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it was really simple in the past, but as of now, he was already a member of the Demon Lord Palace. It wasn’t that simple anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In contrast to Qing Shui’s bewilderment, the old man seemed like he was slightly intoxicated. At first, Qing Shui was a nobody in his eyes, but now he felt that this young man was unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, the old man thought that Qing Shui bore a resemblance to ‘Dragon Head’, so regardless of the relation, he decided to help him. Despite that, he didn’t expect that Qing Shui would grow to this stage at a remarkable speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, it’s unexpected for us to meet each other again in this kind of situation. I see you are from the Soaring Dragon Organization. I will definitely not make the first move. Even if it’s for this stone coffin, I will allow you to make your move first. If you all can take it from me, it will be yours. What do you think of this proposition?” Qing Shui said after a brief consideration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ve grown stronger much too fast. I thought about the day when we would meet again, but I didn’t think it would be this quick and in this situation no less. How many people do you represent?” said Joyous Sage, smilingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Demon Lord and she gave a nod. This gesture warmed Qing Shui’s heart in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can represent myself and the Demon Lord Palace.” said Qing Shui as he turned to look at the old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that both of us do not serve a common interest now. I’m saddened by this. I’ve seen a person who looks just like you. I wonder, do you have a relative out there?” Joyous Sage said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui noticed that Joyous Sage definitely knew about something, otherwise he would not have said something like this with no reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui seemed calm, yet Demon Lord seemed perplexed as she gazed at him. She realized something all of a sudden, then she turned to Qing Shui and said, “You look a lot like the Dragon Head of the Soaring Dragon Organization.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dragon Head of the Soaring Dragon Organization?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The leader of the Soaring Dragon Organization is also known as Dragon Head.” Demon Lord explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now felt that this Dragon Head should be the one he has been looking for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are too many people who look alike. I’m from the Five Continents, so the probability of meeting someone I know here is slim.” Qing Shui didn’t want to implicate his relationship with that man at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This world highly values the virtue of filial piety. If that person was truly his father, then being an enemy with his own father would attract thoughtless remarks from other people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t afraid of gossips, but he wasn’t willing to bear this kind of reputation either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, Qing Shui, I feel like you’re being hostile to me. Beside the point, I think you should really meet with Dragon Head.” Joyous Sage retained a smile on his face. He was currently wearing extravagant clothing, which made him seemed way less celestial than the first time Qing Shui saw him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There will be chance for that. We will talk about it next time. Old man, please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quickly retreated with Demon Lord Hua Rumei and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be honest, he still felt a bit anguished for giving away this stone coffin. He had already received the treasure chest from the fifth palace. The last one was the stone coffin. He couldn’t bear the thought of giving it up, but for the sake of repaying the kindness of the old man who had once helped him, there was no choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you are repaying his kindness, then hand over the rest of the treasure that you must have gotten from the other five palaces!” Just then, an old man beside Joyous Sage started to speak with a grin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui closed his eyes and replied with a smirk, “We’ve already eaten those few items. Also, the two palaces contained nothing. Moreover, I don’t owe you any favor. If you dare nag about it further, I don’t mind making you silent forever.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, reckless and ignorant. I’m not afraid of you, not even the Demon Lord beside you. How can you be so arrogant for being a small soldier from the Demon Lord Palace. Come, just make me silent forever. I want to see how you can make me shut my mouth for eternity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui narrowed his eyes, giving off a stare as sharp as a knife, to which the old man shuddered. Then, at that moment, he saw a tiny golden light flashed and vanished in an instant. Only a few people can see this tiny golden light, but it was no use, as no one could prevent the inevitable. Before a thought could emerge from the old man’s mind, it had already disappeared from his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within less than the time to take a breath, the old man flopped to the ground lifelessly without making any sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm that Qing Shui had used. This mighty power had surprised Qing Shui thoroughly, and it had been a long time since he used the silkworm. It was certainly powerful, but he didn’t expect to kill this old man so swiftly and with such ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden change caused everyone to turn pale from fright. If Qing Shui was able to kill a powerful False God Cultivator that easily, then killing them would be much easier. Joyous Sage could not help but twitch. His face had become slightly pale as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gestured to the old man once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything went smoothly, as the other wicked forces dared not make any moves. Many of them were already treating him as if he was an evil pernicious star. Demon Lord and the two brothers from the Lu Clan could not help but trembled their lips. Now they have to put a lot of consideration in their matters concerning Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this your favor to me?” Joyous Sage returned to normal as he glanced at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui naturally knew that the old man was saying - it was about the slaughter just now. However, he continued to grin and said, “Kindness is always returned tenfold. Old man, I respect you, but I’m not familiar with the others. I’m not used to being threatened either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the scene was dumbfounded by Qing Shui’s method. If not for that, the members of the Soaring Dragon Organization would have made their moves already. Even now, each of them were stifling their anger. They would explode any time if they could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few dozen of them were powerful cultivators who all possessed the dignity of a strong fighter. For them to be terrorized by a young man, their depression was indescribable. In the end, one of them still came forward to confront Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such heresy. If you are so capable, then let us fight in a duel of life and death, fair and square.” Another old man came forward and suggested the idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed, “Heresy can also kill people. Why should I engage in a duel of life and death with you? Are there any benefits to that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you scared? Are you afraid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man challenged provokingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, if I accept any challenges each of you throw at me, then I will be an extremely busy man.” Qing Shui sneered at the slightly stubborn old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, you…. I will kill you today.” The old man said as he unsheathed his greatsword with the intention to rush towards Qing Shui for a kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Hao, come back!” Joyous Sage shouted to stop the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man stopped when he heard Joyous Sage’s words, “Supreme Elder….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Joyous Sage waved his hand and then said to Qing Shui, “You don’t need to repay the fate of us meeting that day, that is not a favor. Since today is lively and you lot are the first to enter the shrine, we will withdraw for today. Also, I would like you to take in consideration to come to the Soaring Dragon when you are free. Perhaps you and our Dragon Head have an extraordinary relationship with one another.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Joyous Sage finished his speech, he led his men and left the place. This was out of Qing Shui’s expectations. He was also aware that the old man was trying to find out his identity when he asked whether Qing Shui could represent the Demon Lord Palace or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man simply left the building. At that moment, Hua Rumei raised her concern, “This isn’t the first or second time he used this kind of tactic. They might steal our treasure halfway our journey.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t matter. No one can stop us.” Qing Shui beamed heroically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the others, especially the members of the Divine Beast Sect and the Wild Ghost Valley, and said, “I will give you a chance. You can take the items inside the stone coffin. I don’t know if there’s anything inside, but if you manage to take them, they are yours. If you don’t take the items, then I will take them. Once I take them, they will be mine. If any of you think of trying something funny, don’t blame me for being ruthless afterwards.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing what Qing Shui had to say, the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley were tempted to try, yet they were afraid to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will withdraw for now. If the Demon Lord Palace will go and take the items, we will give you protection.” At that moment, the attractive woman from the Divine Sound Sect spoke with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled too. This woman was a smart person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can we trust your words?” A scrawny old man came forward and asked Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, I’m not a judgmental person, but I do keep my words. I don’t intend to go back on my word in front of so many people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person talking just now was an old man from the Wild Ghost Valley. People from that place looked like a dried bone and the reason for their appearance was due to their mastery of technique. Not all who joined the Wild Ghost Valley had that kind of appearance. The reason was solely due to the cultivation of the technique of the Wild Ghost Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past during the time at the gates of the Ancient Ruins, that old man from the Divine Beast Sect showed great might and ruthlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chi, how about it? Do you want to join me and see what is inside this stone coffin?” The gloomy, old man looked at the stalwart, old man from the Divine Beast Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not make any remarks while he stood by. He already felt that these four stone giants would not be easy to deal with as he would require the Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique to do so. He wondered whether the Dragon Slaying Beast would be able to breach through them. The two women have nothing to say about Qing Shui’s decision in handing over the stone coffin either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people knew that there must be a reason for Qing Shui to hand over the stone coffin like that. Despite knowing that, they still wanted to try it. The worst they could do was to retreat. If they did not try it, however, they would not be content with the outcome. This was a highly unfavorable bet, yet someone would always enjoy doing it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Twelve people were sent out, with six each from the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley. When that was settled, they turned towards the stone coffin and made their moves. They split into a group of three with one group facing a stone giant each.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These stone giants were massive. Each person were wielding a bulky stone spear as they faced the stone giants. About 100 meters where twelve of them rushed into the vicinity of the stone coffin, these stone giants began to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The long spear in their hands swept across the giants with the formidable strength. That kind of aura could destroy anything invincible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar roar….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The members of the Divine Beast Sect summoned their own demonic beasts. The two brothers of the Lu Clan were also included. The demonic beasts of these people were very strong. After all, those who were able to enter here were all extraordinary people. The members of the Wild Ghost Valley moved like a ghost as their silhouettes would become blurry at times. They were extremely fast in their movements and their attacks had poison element to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After engaging in combat, they were able to understand the might of these stone giants. The demonic beasts and the poison of the Wild Ghost Valley were ineffective against these stone giants. On top of that, the attack from the giants were simply destructive and fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment they engaged in the fight, one demonic beast was instantly annihilated. That caused the members of the Divine Beast Sect and the Wild Ghost Valley to raise their heartbeat instantaneously. Anyone could tell that there was a huge disparity between their power and the strength of the stone giants. They wouldn’t be able to endure much longer against the stone beasts from before, much less against these stone giants now.&nbsp;</span></p>
