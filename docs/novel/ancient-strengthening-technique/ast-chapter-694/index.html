 <p><strong>AST 694 - Another Deity Statue</strong></p>
 <p>Only when a woman had experienced such a moment that she would reveal her weak side. Regardless of how strong she was, she would be weak once the situation was out of her control.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed Hai Dongqing as she headed towards the direction which was slightly on the left of the center. As they strode forward, they saw a huge mountainous area from afar.</p>
 <p>They would still encounter some demonic beasts along the way but Qing Shui’s Emperor's Qi had frightened those beast off. Aside from weakening the abilities of the target, the Emperor’s Qi also had a pressuring effect which was the same to that of an expert.</p>
 <p>Thus, those that had an insufficient strength would be directly frightened away, while the weaker ones might even get paralyzed with fear.</p>
 <p>“We should look around this mound of rubble first, legend said that there were people who had seen an Immortal Foxes here before. However, it said that it was only a two tailed one, we could search the area and try our luck.</p>
 <p>“Sure!”</p>
 <p>Very soon, they had arrived. They could see a large expanse of rubble, so massive that they can’t even see the end of it. When they got closer, they had found out that every piece of debris in this sea of rubble were as large as a pavilion, or even larger than that. They felt as if like they had entered a maze like valley.They were too far away earlier that the mound of rubbles appeared to be so tiny!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s knowledge of the Immortal Fox was based on some of the information he had found. The size of the Immortal Fox varies, it was quite small as a newborn, then its size would increase as it grow stronger. The more tails it had, the larger it will be, just like how a Five Tailed Immortal Fox body could achieve a 100 meters in size. However, once it gained its sixth tail, the size of its body would shrink. Legend said that when it becomes a Nine Tailed Immortal Fox, it would had the same size of an adult human but it had an earth-shattering might that would be incomparably horrifying.</p>
 <p>The Immortal Fox was a unique species, an ordinary fox species could eat some heavenly treasures and evolve into an Immortal Fox. The history books had recorded that the Immortal Fox only had a pure snow-white physique with a tail that had the same length as its body and it had excellent speed and sneak attacks.</p>
 <p>Legend also said that only white foxes could evolve into an Immortal Fox, the other fox species had no way to evolve. It is said that the white fox species had the bloodline of the Immortal Fox. When they had an opportunity to mature, for example when it consumed a heavenly treasure, it would had a certain chance to evolve into an Immortal Fox.</p>
 <p>“En, look!”</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing pointed joyfully into the distance.</p>
 <p>Following her gaze, Qing Shui saw three snow-white foxes with a size of about 2 meters . With just one glance, he could tell that they were all white foxes. Although they were just white foxes, it still made Qing Shui happy.</p>
 <p>This was the Immortal Fox Valley, there should be plenty of fox type demonic beasts. However, even if it was called the Immortal Fox Valley, other types of demonic beasts also resided here.</p>
 <p>“Let us head inside, it was said that in the past someone saw a Two Tailed Immortal Fox in there.” Hai Dongqing smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Sure!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned out the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly and the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. He instructed them to fly by Hai Dongqing’s side, to protect her if any incidents were to occur.</p>
 <p>This was a wild mountainous place, she must have been quite afraid with her current level of cultivation. Qing Shui felt fine, he had the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, the Fire Bird, and a huge group of Jade Emperor Bee. As long as he summoned them out, he felt more confident in his heart.</p>
 <p>Even a cultivator would feel afraid in this place!</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing stood next to Qing Shui’s as they watched the three strong Demonic Beasts that were just about a few meters in size. In addition to the earlier Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird, she now knew that Qing Shui had five strong Demonic Beasts, and every one of them were on the Martial Saint realm.</p>
 <p>She would not have dared to come here alone, the demonic beasts that appeared here were not something that she could deal with. This man that was younger than her was actually able to make her feel especially safe.</p>
 <p>They repeatedly encountered some demonic beasts, although most of them were of the fox species, there were some that were of the snake or leopard species. These kinds of demonic beast shared a common trait with the fox species, which is they were all creatures that were specialized in sneak attacks.</p>
 <p>The imprudent demonic beasts that dared to sneak attack were either killed by Qing Shui or got petrified by the Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly. After that, they would die as a result of the petrification or be poisoned to death by the Jade Emperor Queen Bee.</p>
 <p>This place were both like a mountain stream and a maze. It was good &nbsp;that the rocks’ height were not high, most of them were only at the same level of a three stories pavilion. There were some that resembled a small mountain, which could be seen quite frequently.</p>
 <p>In those huge rocks that resembled a small mountain, there were caves where demonic beasts often stayed in. Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing hoped that they would be able to find a cave that sheltered an Immortal Fox within it.</p>
 <p>They didn’t realize that the sky had already turned dark. This place was not like the city, there was no moonlight here and nothing could be seen once it turned dark. The weather would also become very cold, which was the characteristic of the Icy Cloud Mountain.</p>
 <p>“We will take a rest here, we are not in a rush.” Qing Shui said as he looked at Hai Dongqing beside him.</p>
 <p>“That's fine!”</p>
 <p>The two of them quickly found a large cave not far away. Qing Shui used his spiritual sense to check the cave, and did not find any aura of large demonic beasts. After he was sure that it was safe, he entered inside the cave together with Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing took out some Light Stones from her Interspatial Silk Sachet as they walked inside the cave. It was not yet completely dark outside but aside from the area near the entrance, the inside of the cave was completely pitch dark.</p>
 <p>The Light Stone radiated its light within this very large cave. They were currently in an area that appeared as large as a large palace with a height that was close to 100 meters. With one glance, they could see nine pillars that would require tens of people to move it. A curved path could also be seen further in.</p>
 <p>The Light Stone revealed a layer of dust on the ground, with a few presence of footprints that were left by some animals on it. This was not strange, since it was normal for some demonic beasts to had lived in such a large cave.</p>
 <p>“Should we go in and take a look?” Qing Shui said after he saw that bend.</p>
 <p>“We have nothing better to do anyway, might as well go in and check it out.” Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui before she slowly said, as she could tell that Qing Shui wanted to go in.</p>
 <p>Although it was dark, when one’s abilities became strong, they could still see even at far distances. However, it was still different from seeing with proper lighting as their vision would suffer great limitations in these darkness.</p>
 <p>After they had passed through the curved path, a vision of a huge palace entered Qing Shui’s eyes. He couldn’t believed what he had just seen, so he took another glance but he was still shocked.</p>
 <p>Deity Cave of Immortal!</p>
 <p>It was similar to the palace where he had obtained the Big Dipper Sword. Qing Shui could feel that intense might, and he could also see the Deity Statue inside!</p>
 <p>100 meters!</p>
 <p>The distance from that curved path to that vivid and lifelike Deity Statue was about 100 meters. The statue appeared to be very similar to the previous Deity Statue that he had seen and it was also attired in Daoist clothes.</p>
 <p>The last time he had obtained the Big Dipper Sword, he used the pressure to temper his muscles and bones. However since then, he didn’t have another chance to do it again. Who knew that he would encounter another Deity Statue today.</p>
 <p>“What would it give me this time?” Qing Shui felt excited in his heart.</p>
 <p>This pressure was not effective to people with no cultivation but as long as one had a cultivation, they would feel a mighty pressure. This force would hinder those who had the abilities to damage the statue, and for those who could get near, they would not be able to muster their strength to damage it.</p>
 <p>He had managed to obtain the Big Dipper Sword the previous time because of Luan Luan. At that time, Luan Luan did not have any cultivation but in a blink of an eye, Luan Luan had already undergone her coming-of-age ceremony. This time, he did not know what was inside this Deity Cave of Immortal, but Qing Shui could already see that looking familiar box.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing stared in shock at the scene in front of her but she did not made any sound. Qing Shui took out a thin and long chain that had a faint violet glow from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Then he tied a Frosted Iron Ball to one end.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would want to use the Hidden Weapon Technique to toss the chain to that box. He wanted to use this technique to wrap the chain around the box and then figure out a way to pull it back to him.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>After the Frosted Iron Ball advanced for about 60 meters, it shattered…...</p>
 <p>The strong pressure had actually caused the Frosted Iron Ball to shatter into powder. Qing Shui understood as he mulled over, anything would suffer the pressure from the statue as long as it crossed the borderline.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing was shocked when she saw all of these, as she could feel the pressure of the statue as well. After all, she was currently in the position where the pressure was the weakest.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui was in a dilemma, where could he find a person without a cultivation? The simplest method had actually managed to stumped Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Deity Statue was very precious and extremely difficult to find. Usually, when someone had found it, they would think of ways to take away the treasure from it.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you trying to take that box out? Hai Dongqing asked him at this moment.</p>
 <p>She had seen Qing Shui failed multiple times, and she knew that it was the result of that pressure.</p>
 <p>“En, there should be something good inside that box, it is just that this pressure is too great. The only way is for someone without cultivation to go and tie this chain onto that box.</p>
 <p>The chain in Qing Shui’s hands was no ordinary chain, it was a chain that he had forged with a special metal and the violet jade in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The Frosted Iron Ball did bore the brunt of the pressure and shattered but the chain was unscathed.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing also frowned, she too didn’t know what to do.</p>
 <p>“If only this chain can automatically bind up the box.” Hai Dongqing looked helplessly at the distant box.</p>
 <p>A careless word may reveal much to an attentive listener. As Qing Shui’s heard her said that, his eyes brightened. He was in so much joy that he didn’t think rationally and just grabbed Hai Dongqing by the waist and spun her around…...</p>
 <p>Following that, Qing Shui awkwardly put the stunned and bashful Hai Dongqing down.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, I was too happy.”</p>
 <p>During this period of time where Qing Shui and Di Chen were together, there would be such kind of occurrence sometimes. In his moment of joy, he mistook Hai Dongqing for Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“I’ll forgive you this time, but you can’t do this again in the future.” Hai Dongqing’s face was red. In that moment, her mind went blank as she did not expect Qing Shui to do that. By the time she had regained her senses, she was already back on the ground.</p>
 <p>“I won’t do it again, when I found out how to retrieve the box, I got too excited, I’m sorry.” Qing Shui awkwardly smiled as he apologized.</p>
 <p>“Alright, you don’t have to apologize anymore, you did not intend to do that.” Hai Dongqing said gently after she had calmed down.</p>
 <p>This matter blew over like that. Qing Shui’s idea was to use the Demon Binding Ropes, he took out the tempered Demon Binding Ropes and tied it to one end of the chain.</p>
 <p>He started to walk towards the statue, the distance where he could control the Demon Binding Ropes was less than 100 meters. Although the Demon Binding Ropes level had increased by a grade, the effective distance was only about sixty meters. However, this was not a precise gauge, sometimes it could hit a hundred meters and sometimes just forty meters.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to take precautions, the safest distance was sixty meters. Qing Shui advanced step by step towards the statue while he resisted the huge pressure.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised Nature Energy to its peak and advanced step by step towards the statue!</p>
 <p>One step!</p>
 <p>Two step!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui had advanced by nine steps, he suddenly stepped forward with a distance equivalent to two steps. The pressure he felt appeared to had decreased by at least half…...</p>
