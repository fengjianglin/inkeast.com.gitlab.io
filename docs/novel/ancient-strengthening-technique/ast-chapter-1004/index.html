 <p><strong>AST 1004 - Performing The Soft-Tendon Hand Technique Again, Gold Needle Acupuncture</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt extremely anxious after he finished his sentence. He didn’t have the intention to defile this woman that he highly respected from the bottom of his heart. He was thinking of raising Yiye Jiange’s strength to Martial Emperor as quickly as possible. Only then would she be able to use the Hallow Pill.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was nervous when he was talking just now. He didn’t dare to make eye contact with her. However, he still gave her an earnest look after he finished speaking so that she could feel his sincerity.</p>
 <p>He wouldn’t have dared to say such things in the past. But he said it now because he had no intention of letting this woman go. So this was his first time taking the initiative, although it was a little impetuous.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked into Qing Shui’s clear eyes. She glared at him and slightly lowered her head. She had the medicinal pill that Qing Shui had given to her in her hands. She could feel the wave of powerful energy on it when she took a look at it earlier.</p>
 <p>“How much can it raise my strength?” Yiye Jiange’s voice was very soft.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled. He knew that Yiye Jiange was not talking about the medicinal pill but rather the Gold Needle Acupuncture. “This depends on individual aptitudes. It may double your strength or even multiply it several times but it may also only raise it slightly.”</p>
 <p>“Did you perform this on Luan Luan when she was little?” Yiye Jiange raised her head and smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Yes. I have done this on our daughter when she was little. I had already helped to acupuncture her when we were at the Skysword Sect,” Qing Shui replied with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Just take it as you’ll become my woman in the future and you’ll feel less awkward about it……” Qing Shui advised Yiye Jiange, who had grown quiet once again. He had an indescribable feeling while he was saying all that to this extraordinary woman who had always been someone that mustn’t be defiled in his heart.</p>
 <p>“You have become more and more capable now. Do you enjoy speaking to me this way?” Yiye Jiange’s face was tinted red. There was a hint of strangeness in the tone of her voice. Qing Shui immediately grasped her hand and squeezed it.</p>
 <p>“I do!” Qing Shui laughed while he rubbed his nose with his other hand. For the first time ever, his face also reddened as it was the effect of blood rushing to his head in his excitement.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, even if you performed the acupuncture on me once, it seems like my strength wouldn’t be raised by too much.” Yiye Jiange shook her head lightly and sighed.</p>
 <p>“Woman, you are extraordinary in my heart. I adore you and want to love you dearly. It is very hard for me to bring myself to do this and you have never given me a chance. I have only found some courage after so many years. However, it is never my intention to force you. I have a medicine pill with me here that can allow your strength to increase by quite a lot. But this can only be consumed by Martial Emperor level cultivators,” Qing Shui spoke his mind while he looked at Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was startled. “Are you confident that I’ll reach the Martial Emperor after the acupuncture?”</p>
 <p>“More or less. I will think about some other way. Normally it should take about half a year,” Qing Shui said after thinking. Actually he didn’t really dare to say that he would be able to greatly improve his strength within a month through Duo Cultivation.</p>
 <p>“You really won’t be able to see anything if you covered your eyes?” Yiye Jiange asked Qing Shui while she looked at him with her graceful and gorgeous eyes.</p>
 <p>“I can see!” Qing Shui had no choice but to tell the truth when those indescribably beautiful eyes were just inches away from him.</p>
 <p>“How honest of you. Come to my room tonight……” Yiye Jiange left after she finished speaking.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled wryly. His women and slightly older children had all been acupunctured before. Although strength wouldn’t exponentially increase when this type of acupuncture was received at a young age, the speed of cultivation would be increased. So it was fair to say that the resulting effect of acupuncture was best when received at a young age. Although there was no issue in receiving the acupuncture at Yiye Jiange’s age, it was a little awkward because Qing Shui was a man.</p>
 <p>When Yiye Jiange agreed with Qing Shui, he knew that she wouldn’t marry another man in her life. Qing Shui smiled. He didn’t want to let a woman like her go, no matter how outstanding the other man was.</p>
 <p>This was a change in his mentality. If his woman didn’t love him but instead loved someone else in the past, he would really choose to let her go. But now, he realized that he had changed.</p>
 <p>During the daytime, Qing Shui guided the others from the Qing Clan on their cultivation. But Yiye Jiange’s elegant eyes and that intoxicatingly shy face of hers kept emerging in his mind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had his own room. His women and even the entire Qing Clan knew that he cultivated at night. So basically none of them would bother him at night without a good reason.</p>
 <p>It was still early. Qing Shui normally entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal as soon as the next day came and stayed there until the sky was slightly bright, spending a total of six hours.</p>
 <p>After having their dinner, some went to the backyard to cultivate while some returned to their own private rooms to cultivate. Qing Shui was instead making his way towards Yiye Jiange’s room nervously.</p>
 <p>The distance between their rooms wasn’t far. In fact, the distance between Qing Shui’s room and the few women’s rooms wasn’t that far either. They were basically near to each other, with one room in between at most. But the rooms here were vast as they all contained one small living room and bedroom.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently pushed Yiye Jiange’s door and it opened. He immediately locked it after entering.</p>
 <p>He was in the small living room. He saw Yiye Jiange somewhere nearby when he turned his head around. The two of them remained silent. Qing Shui still felt a little awkward so he could only smile and approach her. Even if a man wasn’t shameless, he’d have to be brazen at times like this.</p>
 <p>He took her hand as they made their way towards the bedroom.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui discovered that Yiye Jiange’s hand was slightly cold and would tremble from time to time. He sighed ruefully too at the fact that a woman that was as divine as her had always been single.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had always felt that Yiye Jiange paid very little attention to things like emotions and affection between a man and woman. She wasn’t being cold about it but was rather indifferent about it. However, Qing Shui couldn’t really ask anything about it right now.</p>
 <p>“You’re very nervous?” Qing Shui teased Yiye Jiange while holding her hand.</p>
 <p>“You’re merely a naughty child in my eyes. I’m not nervous at all,” Yiye Jiange retorted when she saw the teasing look on Qing Shui’s face.</p>
 <p>“Good to hear that. There’s actually nothing to be nervous about. As long as you’re not fully prepared, I’m not going to do anything. Just let me know when you are ready,” Qing Shui said ambiguously.</p>
 <p>Although Yiye Jiange was pretty much inexperienced, she figured out what Qing Shui was trying to say after connecting the dots and seeing that strange look on his face. “You should remember what you have said,” she said weakly after rolling her eyes at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Of course. By then, I must make Jiange fall in love with me. I want Jiange to take off my clothes of her own will on our wedding night,” Qing Shui said heroically…….</p>
 <p>“Go to hell!” Yiye Jiange knocked on Qing Shui’s head.</p>
 <p>Their banter had eased the tension. The two of them arrived at Yiye Jiange’s bedroom. Her bedroom was untainted by even a speck of dust. That snowy white fluffy bed and the bolster on it made him feel great…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t hurried about performing the acupuncture. He was instead feeling her pulse from time to time or pressing on the acupoints on her body, arms and shoulders with his hands.</p>
 <p>The ecstatic Soft-Tendon Hand Technique!</p>
 <p>By now Qing Shui’s skill had become even better. Without realizing it, Yiye Jiange was already leaning in his arms weakly. Both of her hands were placed on Qing Shui’s shoulders while Qing Shui was massaging and pounding softly against her back with both of his hands.</p>
 <p>“Sweetheart*, you better remember you own words. Otherwise I will ignore you for the rest of my life.” Yiye Jiange was giving him a slightly coquettish look with her charming eyes.</p>
 <p>[TL Note: In the raws, Yiye Jiange addressed Qing Shui in an endearing way as how one would address someone who brings you a lot of troubles yet you are unwilling to part with them or when you are in a love-hate relationship with someone.]</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the current condition of Yiye Jiange, he wouldn’t doubt her words either. He was really regretting what he had said just now, something about the wedding night.</p>
 <p>Even so, his blood was still racing from the way she addressed him. He fell backwards, causing Yiye Jiange to end up on top of his body. Her perky and bouncy breasts were pressed flush against Qing Shui’s chest. The pressure and bounciness were shocking.</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui remembered his words, he wasn’t going to devour her. Instead, he could send her to heaven in another way. He placed both of his hands on her perfectly round and divinely gorgeous perky rear. Even with clothes in between them, he could feel its smoothness and softness. That wonderful sensation was indescribable.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, where are your hands going…” Yiye Jiange asked. Her entire body had gone limp and her eyes were already glazed over in pleasure.</p>
 <p>“I won’t devour you. I’m helping you to improve your blood circulation before the acupuncture. Does it feel good?” Qing Shui laughed shamelessly. The speed of his hands that were fondling her body increased even more.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly felt Yiye Jiange’s body tremble. Her limp body suddenly went stiff for a moment. Then it went limp even more than before. It was as if she was really boneless.</p>
 <p>“Do not move!”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange’s cheeks were burning right at this moment. Her eyes were shut. Even her eyelashes quivered. She didn’t dare to look at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing didn’t expect a refined woman like her would be in such state. Given a long enough time, his ecstatic Soft-Tendon Hand Technique could satisfy a woman in another way when used on their sensitive spots.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained unmoving as he tightly held her and chuckled, “How’s my skill?”</p>
 <p>“I’m going to take a bath!”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange got up and left hurriedly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had only done all this to loosen up Yiye JIange. In no less than half an hour, Yiye Jiange emerged again wrapped in a snowy white towel. Her silky hair was draped over her shoulders, causing her to appear alluring. Qing Shui was dazzled by her exposed skin that was fair like the snow.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to cover your eyes anymore. Just don’t stare…” Yiye Jiange said softly while she took a seat beside Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I can only look at your back since you are sitting in front of me. I’m not gonna look at whatever that’s on the front side. Don’t be alarmed if I touched what I shouldn’t touch. Just take it as you will also be mine in the future anyways……”</p>
 <p>“Brat, stop saying nonsense. I know you want me to relax. If I am willing to do this, do you still need further explanation?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed. He slowly reached out to take off her bath towel, her jade-like body that was like the work of heaven revealed before his eyes. Her fair and silky skin was lustrous like jade.</p>
 <p>Her delicate neck was long and the mounds in front of her chest seemed like they would be able to fit just right into his hands. They weren’t huge but round and perky. On top of that, they had the most perfect shape.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out his Gold Needles and started to perform the acupuncture without misbehaving. He didn’t really avoid anything. Yiye Jiange closed both of her eyes instead. Her beautiful face was red. She stopped caring if Qing Shui was looking or not.</p>
 <p>A lot of acupoints on her body were half-cleared and she only had one at most that was about to be cleared. Seeing up to this point, Qing Shui was extremely happy. Clearing these acupoints would be a great enhancement. Her strength in battle would also be raised tremendously.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>……....</p>
 <p>Nurturing constitution, arousing potential, clearing acupoints, strengthening meridians and dantian.</p>
 <p>Three hours passed in just a flash.</p>
 <p>There were at most 108 needles on Yiye Jiange’s body at one time. They covered almost her entire body. Of course this also allowed Qing Shui to take a good look at every part of her. There were even three Gold Needles at the edge of her most private place. Even the indifferent Yiye Jiange was so embarrassed that she was almost defeated.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui was done taking them off one by one, she immediately went off to take a bath, not daring to even spare another glance at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he put away all the Gold Needles.</p>
