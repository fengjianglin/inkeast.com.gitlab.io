If you still refuse to come out, I wouldn't mind killing everyone in Hundred Miles City." The man's deep voice once again rang out from skies.</span></p>

Fortunately, it was not a very tall height, and the man did not suffer from much injuries. However, he became very disheveled and seemed to be in a very sorry state. And his most beloved ride was dead...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the Soulshake bell in his hands. He had never thought that the chances of causing demonic beasts to die would suddenly happen. This man was really one of extremely poor morals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at this weird scene, the remaining four people quickly landed their demonic beasts and looked at that man who was wearing a 2-color graded battle armor .In that instant, they felt that this young man was very dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I don't like to be lifting my head when talking to other people!" Qing Shui said as he smiled, &nbsp;seeing that the few men who had landed were all middle-aged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His smiling mood made every feel that Qing Shui was like the pine tree on top of of a cliff. This line had stunned a lot of them, especially those from Qing Clan. At this moment, they felt extremely proud, proud to be a member of Qing Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Awesome! Qing Shui, we support you! Represent out Hundred Miles City to kill this group of shameless beasts!"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that these people were from Xinan Medicinal King's Clan. Moreover, the ones who had been throwing their weight around before, doing evils and creating havoc, were also from the same clan. Earlier, one of them had even claimed that they would kill everyone from Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who had shouted out earlier was a person who had managed to survive after his whole family was killed. To him, life was nothing important anymore. He was no longer young, and his wife, children, parents had all died terribly in the hands of Li Long and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that someone had started cursing, many others who were also bullied &nbsp;immediately followed suit, venting out their anger and frustration. At this moment, they were no longer afraid of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Chap! You were the one who killed my Junior Martial Brother Li Long!" The middle-aged man who had fell down earlier had been staring at Qing Shui in fury and could not help but wish to devour him in one bite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"He deserves to die. Letting him die is going too easy on them." Qing Shui said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Long San, Master had instructed us not to act presumptuously. See how this crafty this chap is. What shall we do?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, an elegant looking middle-aged man frowned and spoke to the other man from earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's there to be afraid of? It's just a small Hundred Miles City. So what if it's the whole Cang Lang Country? Junior Li Long and the others cannot die for nothing. Today, I must let this chap pay with his own blood. If Master blames us, I'll take up the responsibility by myself." The middle-aged man called Long San said with determination.</span></p>

I believe that Master would not give us too severe a punishment. He treats us quite well, and now, there's only the few of us left." A slightly younger man at the back smiled teasingly, his hooked nose and thin lips made him appear extremely vicious and unfeeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not say a word, seeming unbothered as he looked towards the five men. All five of them were at the Martial King level, and Qing Shui had to reevaluate the prowess of the Medicine King's clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, he had only heard that they were a very strong clan, one of the strongest in Xinan Country. Xinan Country was also the strongest one in Greencloud Continent, after the Continent's Capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the abilities of the five men today made Qing Shui felt that the Medicine King's clan was truly powerful. At the same time, he was also slightly worried for Qing Clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was truly sad to be weak. Qing Shui held the Big Dipper Sword in his right hand. If he had reached the Martial Saint level, he would not need to be so worried about this and that, and would not have driven Qing Clan to the edges of a cliff countless times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And just then, that middle-aged man called Long San took up a large saber, which looked similar to a "cavalry sword", and walked towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His great build and the "cavalry sword", which was as long as a person's height, emitted a powerful domineering aura as his eyes looking at Qing Shui vengefully.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long San stared at Qing Shui. While his junior Li Long was at the pinnacle of Xiantian, Long San believed that Qing Shui was only at the elementary of the Martial King level. It was because the Qing Shui was too young. He felt that Li Long must have been either too careless, or his opponent must have some kind of extremely powerful armor and weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, after seeing Qing Shui's armors and weapons, he knew that he must have been right, but he did not care. It was because he had his own "Mountain Splitting Saber Art"!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To him, Qing Shui's sword and the 2-color graded armors he was wearing was nothing before his Mountain Splitting Saber Art. When his "Jasper Quartz Saber" performed the "Mountain Splitting Saber Art", not even a top grade heavy armor would be able to stand up to one hack from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very worried at the start, but now, he was no longer so. It was because he did not think well of his opponent's abilities. This person who was charging towards him was at the elementary stage of grade 4 Martial King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grade 4 Martial King was now nothing to Qing Shui. Back then, in the same place, he was driven to his ends by a grade 4 Xiantian to the extent that even the whole clan could have been reduced to ruins. He suddenly felt very emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll say it one more time. You still have time to scram!" Qing Shui calmly said to Long San who was walking towards him.</span></p>

Who had ever dared to speak to him like this? Even his Master had valued this disciple very much, and although he had taken in a junior as a closed disciple, it did not affect him much. But this young man right in front of him now actually dared to speak to him like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he had made a fool of himself earlier, losing his ride. The more he thought about it now, the more furious he became. With a loud roar, he leapt up with great force from his legs and speed as fast as an ape, the Jasper Quartz Saber in his hand waving out in a crescent shaped swing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh, slap slap!</span></p>

After the blade struck, it left a clear crescent afterimage in midair.</span></p>

He had not expected his opponent to have brought such a martial technique which focused on disposition and strength to such a great level and speed. But it was too bad that it was not facing Qing Shui.</span></p>
