 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that he wouldn’t need to fight today even if he insisted. When Qing Shui saw Young Master Lang’s hesitation, he stood up and walked toward the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Lang remained silent, repeatedly clenching and unclenching his fists. After doing so for multiple times, he finally chased after Qing Shui, “Mister Qing, please wait!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he turned around, “Could it be that you have made up your mind to battle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No… There is no meaning in fighting. Mister Qing, please give me your guidance.” Young Master Lang bowed and sincerely asked Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t sure of how he felt about this man. He was ambitious, even pretending to be a spoiled child to further his schemes. As to losing his true nature, it wasn’t surprising given that it’s way too difficult to maintain one’s heart under those circumstances. It wasn’t scary to make mistakes. What’s truly terrifying was repeatedly making mistakes, which could even lead to losing one’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t help you. Go home and rediscover yourself.” Qing Shui shook his head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Lang sighed, bowing towards Qing Shui again before leaving forlornly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t believe that a person could change his or her true nature. At the very least, it wasn’t something that could be changed that easily. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be the saying of “it’s easier to change rivers and mountains than to alter a person’s nature”. Though for now, it might seem that Young Master Lang had become humble, it’s just a temporary situation caused by what he was going through. Once he soared once again in the future, it wouldn’t take long for him to reveal his true nature once again. In fact, things might even get worse and he might intensify his effort in doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t want to have anything to do with Lang Clan. Though it’s also an aristocratic clan, Qing Shui didn’t expect for clans like this would be very lively. At least for the time being, he has yet to notice any particular person from Lang Clan who was filled with hope and could carry the entire clan on its back and continue moving forward. Other than that, it was about Clan Head Lang. Qing Shui wasn’t particularly fond of getting familiar with people with Clan Head Lang who had no regards for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Shang Clan, the most dominant existence across this large city driven by business, for the time being, Qing Shui has yet to have the chance to interact with them. However, ever since he came here, Qing Shui has been doing things his own way. He felt that it wasn’t necessary for him to do so as the forces here were unable to cause him any threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, Qing Shui’s main intention was to build up the Imperial Cuisine Hall. After that, his next step would be to establish his own forces and form his own organization. As for the location where this organization would be formed? Qing Shui has decided that it would be in this huge city. It’s just that for now, Qing Shui has yet to think of a name for the organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle God Palace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At one point, Qing Shui had thought about using this name. But if he did so, it wouldn’t take long for him to expose his own identity, causing him to be the target of the true Demon Lord Inheritors. Hence, for a long time, Qing Shui has been hesitant on whether or not he should use it. Another problem was that even after he established his own forces, he couldn’t just stay here for the whole time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong and the others were the compulsory candidates for him to establish his forces. As for his wives, Qing Shui didn’t plan to let them join in for the time being. Of course, if it’s their wish to join in, Qing Shui would welcome them to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the time being, these were Qing Shui’s only plans. He was also very eager to achieve them. It shouldn’t be long until he could start getting his project undergoing. Hence, Qing Shui was currently at a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it might seem like developing his forces would be a very easy task. But when one pursued true forces, it was actually quite a handful thing to do to achieve the kind which Qing Shui desired. After all, it required expert warriors. If it had only required normal warriors, naturally, it wouldn’t be that hard a task to achieve it. Whether or not they would stay loyal was a different story. Unfortunately, warriors of that caliber couldn’t really be any useful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought about the Sunset Seaking Palace and Dragonwolf Palace which Yiye Jiange and the other girls were in. In the future, they should be able to achieve great things. As for Qing Clan, everything would be fine with Yehuang Guwu there. Moving on to the Lotus Sect, for now, Qing Shui couldn’t predict what would happen to them as he didn’t know whether or not they could move into the Nine Continents World inthe future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t want to bother them unless they were willing to come of their own accord. For the time being, he was still hesitant on whether or not he should use the name Battle God Palace. Beside, he has also only managed to find very few Battle God Inheritors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that he has yet to find a person to even discuss the idea with, he shook his head. For now, his priority would be to build a steady ground for himself across Great Shang City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui decided to concentrate fully on refining his cultivations. In the daytime, he would keep an eye on the Imperial Cuisine Hall. In any case, he could still spend his nighttime cultivating in the realm. He wasn’t short of time. For the time being, he still has another mission. The current Imperial Cuisine Hall was lacking in manpower. Luckily, it has yet to become too well-known around the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it wouldn’t take long until the Imperial Cuisine Hall became prosperous. For the time being, Qing Shui was only focusing on attending to the patient’s illnesses. He has yet to do anything regarding the food business.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a few days, the Imperial Cuisine Hall has finally got onto the right track. It was slowly building up its reputation, though it’s still insufficient to ensure a steady business, after all, they have recently just opened. Today, a guest came to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Qing Shui was stunned when he saw that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Barbarian Emperor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he approached him, “Big brother, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very surprised. Backthen before Qing Shui left, he has said before that he planned to go to the True Nine Continents World with him. But because he has yet to stable down, he told him that he would only come to pick him up after a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, you failed to keep your promise. Luckily, the speed of my mount is fast enough for me to rush through my journey to get all the way here. Fortunately, I also have a unique ability which enables me to detect the approximate location where you are at.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Qing Shui began to find the Barbarian Emperor’s ability to be very unique. It felt as though he shared an unusual link with the people whom he knew and was able to detect the rough location where they were at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Putting all that aside, Qing Shui was still very happy to see the Barbarian Emperor here. He extended his hand and patted the Barbarian Emperor’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was the Barbarian Emperor’s savior. By now, the Barbarian Emperor had already thrown away everything regarding the Great Confucian Emperor. His purpose for coming here this time was precisely to help Qing Shui out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was quite fond of people like him who shared the same destiny of an emperor as him. At the very least, having this kind of people around him might bring him great luck. It was a phenomenon which words couldn’t describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Barbarian Emperor was a warrior who practiced the authentic body cultivations technique. The technique which he cultivated was the Great Sun Divine Fist. It was a very firm fist technique and was also a unique inheritance which only he had. His martial technique was known as the East Violet Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, Qing Shui had already helped raised the Barbarian Emperor’s strength back when he was still in Great Confucian Empire. As of now, the strength of the Barbarian Emperor was almost Qing Shui’s equal, though this was just taking into account their default strength. In an actual battle, Qing Shui would have no problem defeating the Barbarian Emperor. Furthermore, he could do it with ease.</span></p>

The Barbarian Emperor was a very carefree and humble person. His only problem was that he might be a bit too straightforward at times. He has some degree of respect to Qing Shui. Deep down, he really admired this young man who bestowed him a second chance to live.</span></p>

Even if Qing Shui was to let him die now, he would do so without any hesitations. This was also why Qing Shui was so happy and felt that the Barbarian Emperor might be able to help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well as of now, I could already be considered to be homeless. Even if something happened to you, you must make sure that I at least have a place to live in.” The Barbarian Emperor smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the Barbarian Emperor might seem like he was joking with what he said. Qing Shui knew that he was trying to tell Qing Shui that he was willing to give up on everything just to look for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are brothers. From the beginning until now, I have always felt that I can get along very well with you. Actually, even if you hadn’t come to see me, I would have gone and looked for you myself. It’s great to see you here!” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Like you said, we are brothers, so please stop acting so formally in front of me. In the future, I will dedicate my life to following after you! Even if you want me to face countless swords or volcanoes, I will not knit my brows at all.” The Barbarian Emperor smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood what the Barbarian Emperor meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Imperial Cuisine Hall was just a newcomer, yet it had already completely offended Lang Clan. Only when they saw people from the Shang Clan did Qing Shui realize that he had neglected someone and that someone was the Shang Clan woman who had married the Lang Clan Head. When a woman was driven crazy, they could no longer be measured with logics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a woman with above average look. Compared to Qing Ci, she still lacked a bit of beauty. There were about ten men around her. Among them, two of them were elderly men. The two elderly men had very steady steps. Their Taiyang Acupoint was bulging very high. They also had quite a small figure which looked very muscular.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman wore a very luxurious long dress. She also had quite a decent figure with fat buttocks and bulging breasts. Her face was shaped well and also looked very pale. She had a pair of bright eyes and long eyelashes. It’s just that because the corner of her eyes were slightly curved upwards, it made her looked a bit fierce. At this moment, when she spotted Qing Ci who was attending to the patient’s illnesses, her expression suddenly turned hideous.</span></p>
