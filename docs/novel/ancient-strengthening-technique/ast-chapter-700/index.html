 <p><strong>AST 700 - &nbsp;Obtaining the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox blood!</strong></p>
 <p>In an instant, the entire place was already in ruins. The entire place was a mess. &nbsp;Luckily, the battle only took place in the middle of the sky. Otherwise, the surface wouldn’t have only been a mess, the entire stone forest would have been totally destroyed.</p>
 <p>The fight between giant demonic beasts looked really spectacular and marvelous. Not only did they use their Inner Core to initiate Inner Core attacks, they also relied on their strong physiques to continuously clash against and bite one another.</p>
 <p>Bang-bang!</p>
 <p>The loud and clear oppressive noise echoed really far away. The powerful colliding force was definitely beyond that of what human warriors could take because the bodies of the demonic beasts were several times tougher.</p>
 <p>The Ice Fire Ferocious Lion took the opportunity to breathe out an abundant blue ice flame at the Skywolf’s nape. After that, it took yet another opportunity and consecutively breathed out two ice blue flames and swiftly scratched the Skywolf with all four of its claws. With its stately action, the lion created a series of enormous dark shadows. Its speed was as fast as lightning.</p>
 <p>It was in the nature of wolves to be sly. They were also professionals when it comes to hiding themselves. This time, however, the wolf had to face dangers one after another. Despite this, the Skywolf didn’t seem to show the least bit of concern.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, it let out a loud roar into the sky.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A faint circle of light emerged from its jet black body and completely blocked the thick ice flame. After that, it suddenly turned its body around and abruptly scratched the belly of the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion with its steel-like claws.</p>
 <p>The entire thing happened really quickly. It’s worth-noting that a demonic beast’s weakness often lay in its belly.</p>
 <p>The Ice Fire Ferocious Lion immediately withdrew its claws to protect its belly. But right at this moment, the Skywolf fiercely whipped its tail towards the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion’s nape.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Skywolf continued to scratch the Ice Flame Fierce Lion’s belly with its claws in an attempt to break its defense but its huge tail continued to whip it like a huge whip.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Mystic Bird violently spitted out a green fireball towards the Skywolf. The fireball was only the size of a fist. It swiftly made its way towards the Skywolf’s Inner Core.</p>
 <p>Greenwood Flame!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this was the Mystic Bird’s most powerful flame. It was almost on par with the Fire Bird’s Hellfire. However, the Mystic Bird not only had powerful strength, it was even able to compress the flame into such a small size. It definitely possessed terrifying strength.</p>
 <p>For both Sword Qi and demonic beast’s Core Qi attacks, larger size didn’t necessarily mean more power. On the contrary, for both the Fire Bird’s and Mystic Bird’s attacks, their flame attacks would have even more power if they were smaller in size.</p>
 <p>The Skywolf swiftly flipped over and avoided the flame. The Greenwood Flame almost scratched past the Skywolf as it flew through.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really surprised. The demonic beasts at these kind of cultivation levels were truly intelligent. They actually knew this method of saving their companions. Qing Shui looked towards the Mystic Bird, it seemed that this really wasn’t mere coincidence.</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird was intelligent. The skywolf was not bad either.</p>
 <p>While the Mystic Bird was distracted, the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox took the opportunity and swiftly moved to the side of the Mystic Bird. It formed a large web with all five of its enormous tails and enveloped the Mystic Bird.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird felt intimidated and immediately opened up both of its wings.</p>
 <p>Bang-bang-bang…...</p>
 <p>It was a series of enormous loud noises. Feathers that looked as if they were tangled up with metal dropped down one after another. The Five-Tailed Immortal Fox penetrated through the Mystic Bird’s wings with its long tails and immediately bound it tightly.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The Ice Flame Fierce Lion let out a furious roar of rage and wanted to save the Mystic Bird. However, the sly Skywolf beside it was stubbornly suppressing it.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>The torso of the Mystic Bird was bound by the Immortal Fox’s tail. Under the confinement of the Immortal Fox, it was unable to even shoot out a Greenwood Flame. Being bound this way, the Mystic Bird was already considered to be useless. The Immortal Fox’s most deadly weapon was its five tails.</p>
 <p>Even if it was to grow to adult size and turn into the Nine-Tailed Immortal Fox in the future, it would still be able to change the size of its tails at will. In fact, it would be even stronger and it would be able to bind creatures that were hundreds of meters long.</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird chirped continuously but only in a futile attempt. It couldn’t do anything about it and seemed to be asking the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion for help. It may have a beautiful dream, but often, reality was cruel.</p>
 <p>It’s true that similar things would often end up together. Considering that foxes were also sly, it’s normal that the Skywolf and Five-Tailed Immortal Fox would end up together. In comparison, the Mystic Bird and the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion were at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>Mystic Bird was an honorable bird. It had an upright attitude and was also one of the most righteous flying beasts across the World of the Nine Continents. It would never attack humans without cause. In fact, it would even save them. There were a lot of legends about the Mystic Bird. Basically, it’s thought to be a beast which brought blessings.</p>
 <p>Yet now, it was being tightly bound by the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox. At this moment, the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox turned around and looked at the tightly bound Mystic Bird. There seemed to be an arrogant and sly smile on its fox face.</p>
 <p>“Mystic Bird cannot die.” Qing Shui was at a loss. However, he knew that the Mystic Bird couldn’t afford to die. Once it died, the Ice Flame Fierce Lion would also end up really vulnerable. By then, his plan to get the Immortal Fox’s blood would be ruined.</p>
 <p>“Stay here and don’t move. Remember, don’t move.” Qing Shui gently whispered to Hai Dongqing’s ear.</p>
 <p>The numb and itchy feeling in Hai Dongqing’s ear made her blush. But very quickly, she was shocked by Qing Shui’s words: “What do you want to do?”</p>
 <p>“Be a good girl and listen to me. Remember what I said.” Qing Shui once again reminded her.</p>
 <p>He slowly walked out and immediately operated his strength all the way to its peak. He also summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and took out both the Violet Gold Divine Shield and Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Heavenly Talisman!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t care about anything. He immediately charged towards it with Instantaneous Diamond Evasion. He used all his weakening abilities as well as summoning the Jade Emperor Queen Bee and Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly.</p>
 <p>Poison Killer Sting!</p>
 <p>Petrification!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to hide any of his skills, He used up whatever he deemed useful under the situation. After he did all of this, he took out two Frosted Iron Balls and immediately tossed them towards the head of the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox with the hidden weapon technique—Twin Dragon Explosion.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if the Heavenly Talismans from before actually worked. However, a few of the weakening techniques were unavoidable. He didn’t go on to thoroughly feel the drop in strength of his enemy.</p>
 <p>Following a reverberating chirp, a wood green colored light flashed. The Mystic Bird broke free from the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox. At present, the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox no longer possessed enough strength to trap the Mystic Bird.</p>
 <p>Actually, the side which Qing Shui assisted would definitely emerge victorious. This was because the four powerful demonic beasts had almost equal strength. Previously, Qing Shui didn’t dare to step in because demonic beasts were different from humans. If he was to be assaulted by all four of them as soon as he appeared, things would turn out even uglier.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui made his move at the moment when the Skywolf and the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion was still battling against one another and when the Mystic Bird was struggling from the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox. The reason why Qing Shui chose Mystic Bird was because of its honorable trait, unlike the sly Skywolf and Five-Tailed Immortal Fox. Not to mention that his purpose in coming here was precisely to make the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox bleed.</p>
 <p>This was the most important thing!</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui chose the Mystic Bird, it still bore the same risk. Fortune comes from danger, not to mention that Qing Shui had also prepared himself an escape route. Hence, this was his last resort. If he didn’t make his move and both the Mystic Bird and Ice Fire Ferocious Lion ended up getting killed, he wouldn’t be able to do anything but watch as the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox left.</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird that managed to break free seemed to be quite furious. Previously, if it hadn’t been for the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion, it wouldn’t have been bound so easily by the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox.</p>
 <p>As soon as it opened up its mouth, a green fireball could be seen shooting towards the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox’s head. Simultaneously, as it flapped its wings, a pair of steel-like wings whizzed through the air towards the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox.</p>
 <p>At present, Qing Shui’s brain was working very hard. He hoped that neither side would win so that he would be able to gain the most benefit out of it. However, he knew that the possibility of this happening was quite low. Even though the demonic beasts didn’t have high intelligence, they still had very keen senses. For example, the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox was planning to throw away everything and escape,</p>
 <p>Like Qing Shui would let it get away. When he saw the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox give off silver light, he quickly tossed the Demon Binding Rope at it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what battle technique the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox used. However, he knew that it was definitely not a battle technique used to escape. Coincidentally, the Demon Binding Ropes could also interfere with it using battle techniques.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Mystic Bird arrived, causing the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox to flee right away. But now, there was a huge gap between their strengths. Even though the fox managed to avoid its claws attacks, its belly still got injured from the Mystic Bird’s enormous wings.</p>
 <p>Fresh blood immediately started flowing out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to slow down.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>He quickly appeared below the place where the Five-Tailed Demonic Beast was bleeding and pulled out the huge porcelain bottle that he had long since prepared. After filling it, he sealed it and threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was afraid that it was not enough. So, he filled up two more bottles.</p>
 <p>This amount blood was just like a hair from nine oxen to the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox, especially now that the blood was constantly flowing out of its body. This made Qing Shui feel particularly wasteful since he had been putting in so much effort looking for the Immortal Fox’s blood.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui got his hands on the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox’s blood, he felt a lot calmer and less anxious. Now, he was hesitating about whether he should leave this place because actually, the fate of this place had nothing to do with him.</p>
 <p>Due to his interruption, the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox and Skywolf that were initially at an advantage instantly got all of their advantage turned against them. This seemed to be &nbsp;unfair to them.</p>
 <p>There seemed to be no such thing as fairness in the world, including that of humans. Powerful humans would be given the privilege to have harems and live an extravagant life whereas some people wouldn’t be able to even marry an ugly woman. The later generations of a rich family in particular, they’re already destined to have a lot more things than people who spent their live fighting for a living.</p>
 <p>Similarly in the animal’s world, for example a pack of wolves, the leader of the wolves would have all the female wolves. Wherever you go, the rules stayed the same. The ones who were capable would end up gaining a lot of things.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was planning to let the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox live. In any case, he managed to get the Immortal Fox blood because of it. But as he saw its malicious expression, he took back his intention to do so.</p>
 <p>Fox type and wolf type demonic beasts were the most vengeful and ungrateful demonic beasts. Since that was the case, them dying here should be for the best. Also, Qing Shui had long since taken a fancy to the valuable fox skin. That was the skin of the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox.</p>
 <p>Every time the Mystic bird used the Greenwood Flame to burn Five-Tailed Immortal Fox, Qing Shui would feel an excruciating pain in his heart. It was such a waste because the skin of the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox was worth several cities.</p>
 <p>Luckily, the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox was only a hundred meters long, he already had all the beast parchments that he needed. Qing Shui saw the injured Five-Tailed Immortal Fox slowly turning its head to look at the Skywolf and Ice Fire Ferocious Lion that were struggling against one another.</p>
 <p>In comparison, even though the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion was almost on par with the Skywolf in terms of strength, it wasn’t as experienced and sly. Hence, it would only be able to hold it off for a short period of time. As the battle dragged on, it would start to be at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>The only thing was that the Skywolf seemed to want was to escape now but it was bound stubbornly by the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion. If this went on, the two would be occupied with fighting against each other. They were both already injured.</p>
 <p>Binding Talisman.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took the opportunity and tossed the Binding Talisman at it.</p>
 <p>These demonic beasts were all speed type demonic beasts. Since he didn’t plan to let the Five-Tailed Immortal Fox leave, he naturally came to the conclusion of not letting the Skywolf flee either. Both of these demonic beasts had sly natures. The first thing that came into their minds as soon as they encountered danger was to flee. In comparison, the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion and the Mystic Bird were different. It didn’t matter if it was humans or demonic beasts, Qing Shui hated the cold and ruthless things the most.</p>
