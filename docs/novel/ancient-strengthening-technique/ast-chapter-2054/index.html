 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere of the New Year was becoming heavier and heavier. This place was just like many other places. When a year ended, they would also prepare themselves to celebrate the New Year. They would do so by hanging lanterns, lighting up firecrackers and fireworks. Those who could go home would do so as soon as possible so that they could celebrate the New Year together with their families.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had lost count of the times he celebrated the New Year alone while away from his home. Ever since he became an adult, he rarely celebrated the New Year at home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While walking outside the street, Qing Shui observed the friendly and noisy scenes around him. A lot of adults were having fun with their children. When they saw any tiny objects or food, they would buy it for their children. From time to time, loud and clear noises of children’s laughter could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lot of young men and women could be seen holding hands while strolling around the street. They enjoyed their times together. Shy smiles could be seen hanging on their faces. The scenes of young men and women together made a lot of people feel reminiscent of themselves in the past. They would smile happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This reminded Qing Shui of Shi Qingzhuang. He also started thinking about his own past. There were some things which he could only think about. The shy feeling which he used to have before was gone, but now, he got himself an intimate wife, and it gave him a sense of warmth in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qing Shui saw a woman walking towards him from far away. It was Shen Huang. She actually came at a time like this. She should be here to look for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like usual, she was still stunningly beautiful to the point one could only look at her from below. This elegant woman had caught the attention of many people. Merely having the opportunity to look at her was already a fortunate thing to them. It was similar to the feeling when he traveled to certain beautiful sceneries in his previous incarnation. The feeling was hard to describe in words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was dressed in a snow-white dress with a phoenix pattern sewed on it. Her clear and exquisite pupils, as well as her aura which felt untainted by even a speck of dust, everytime Qing Shui looked at her, he would start to lose control over himself and become distracted. Yet, at the same time, he also wouldn’t come up with any dirty thoughts. While in front of her, he would feel very shameful and insecure about himself. As a matter of fact, very few men would actually feel stimulated while they were in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not the case of her being not beautiful enough. On the contrary, she was too beautiful, beautiful to the point that many people would feel pressured looking at her. Men would turn into clowns while standing in front of her. It felt as though no matter how they tried to hide it, they would still feel a sense of inferiority to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could already be considered as an experienced man. He dared to admit that he possessed quite a decent mindset. But whenever he was in front of her, he still couldn’t help but feel inferior to her and as a result, this caused him to be unable to come up with the thought to conquer her. He kept having the feeling that he wasn’t good enough for her. Just by the fact that he had already gotten multiple wives, he already felt that he wasn’t good enough for her. What else could he expect from her if he was unable to even dedicate to her with his complete love?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest mistress, Happy New Year!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the last day before the New Year. Qing Shui never thought that he would meet Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am here to celebrate the New Year with you. Do you welcome me here?” Shen Huang smiled and looked at Qing Shui. She walked over to him. They were very close to each other. To the point, Qing Shui could smell a bit of her perfume,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do! Of course, I do! I was just about to complain that I feel a bit lonely celebrating the New Year alone.” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui unintentionally made Shen Huang blushed with his words. He froze temporarily knowing that there was a bit of ambiguity in his words. However, he never thought that the goddess-like woman would start to think so much, thus, he quickly said, “You are thinking too much. I don’t mean it that way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What way?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, I don’t mean that I want to do anything to you. I just want to celebrate the New Year with you.” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You naughty boy, In your dreams! Of course, we are just going to celebrate the New Year together. Do not start having wild thoughts about me.” Shen Huang shot a glare at Qing Shui. She seemed to be very relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, you wouldn’t know it even if I harbor any dirty thoughts about you.” When Qing Shui was saying this, he noticed Shen Huang’s upright breasts. They were both shaped really well, causing Qing Shui to start imagining things on her snow white and perfectly round balls. They were so perfectly upright that they were like two bamboo shoots, bulged up and pointy. While thinking about all that, he started imagining the sensations if he were touched them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can sense whoever that harbors evil or dirty thoughts on me within an area of ten feet. I never expected you to be so vulgar.” At this moment, Shen Huang blushed. She shot a glare at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. He gave Shen Huang a silly look. At the moment, he felt as if he was fully naked standing in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can also be very vulgar…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed that she knew what he was thinking. Any dirty or evil thoughts within an area of ten feet… The intentions which he harbored before could definitely be considered as a threat. Her ability was too fearsome. In battles, given that her opponents were close enough, she would be able to figure out how they planned to deal with her. This could be viewed as a sort of mind-reading ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well… By nature, we desire food and sex. Eldest mistress, I wouldn’t have been put in such an embarrassing situation if you had told me earlier.” At the moment, Qing Shui was feeling quite embarrassed. This was no different from taking a peek at her during bathing and being caught red-handed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response to that, Shen Huang chuckled, “You have always followed your rules strictly. In the past, you refused to touch me even when I was poisoned by those kinds of aphrodisiac. It made me think that you might really have no feelings for me. I was even depressed for a long time because of that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave Shen Huang a blank look before muttering a few words, “Well… A goddess is still a woman…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am very happy. Accompany me to stroll around the street.” Sheng Huang smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui was no longer able to see through her. He didn’t have the slightest idea on what this woman was thinking. He knew that the filthy thoughts, which he had before, had helped them get even closer with each other. What kind of a situation was this? Could it be that this woman really liked naughty men?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that the biggest reason behind her interest towards him was because of his refusal to touch her even when he had the best opportunity to do it. At that time, he had already made his way deep into her heart. She knew that he was a righteous man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have told you before that I truly regretted it. If I was given another chance, I would definitely go for the easiest method.” Qing Shui said in a regretful tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not ever say that again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang and Qing Shui were walking shoulder to shoulder by the street. They were just like a pair of young couples except that this couple attracted a lot of the people’s eyes. Shen Huang looked way too beautiful and Qing Shui could also be considered as a handsome and elegant man. When they walked together, they became the target that was admired by many. However, unlike other guys and girls, they weren’t holding hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui had a bit of desire to hold her hand. For now, he didn’t have the intention to own her. It was just a simple feeling of comfort which he was looking for. His thought, for the time being, was still quite pure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui felt a sense of warmth appearing on his palm, he gently grabbed on the pale hand. He had forgotten that the woman could sense what he was thinking. Even though what he was thinking might not be such a huge threat, but merely his thought of holding her hand was already a signal of a potential danger later on.</span></p>

Maybe because she knew that Qing Shui didn’t harbor any dirty intentions in his mind and he really only wanted something to comfort his lonely heart, the woman immediately extended her hand so that he could grab it.</span></p>

It was warm and smooth like jade. Qing Shui was able to feel a lot of comfort from the faint warmth which he felt. He happily held her hand and continued walking, “Thank you!”</span></p>

She raised it just at the right angle and as a result, it made her looked very attractive. Even she herself didn’t know how fatal that smile of hers was.</span></p>

However, it wasn’t really a problem as the people here had great constitutions. Even an ordinary person wouldn’t have to wear thick clothes in a world of ice and snow. After all, they were different when compared to the people in his previous incarnation. The majority of people whom he knew from his previous incarnations suffered from sub-health conditions.</span></p>

The New year would soon arrive. It was welcomed with snowflakes in the sky. Such a world, a world with snowflakes floating in it, was very, very beautiful.</span></p>
