 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's going on?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you still remember the Hua Clan?" Lan Lingfeng looked at Qing Shui with a strange expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hua Clan? Mmm, there's a clan like that. I remember that I encountered them on the first day I came here. Didn't the manor of the Imperial Cuisine Hall here belong to them?" Qing Shui said, remembering them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn't only remember them, but also someone from the Hua Clan—the Second Young Master. That handsome profligate son of the Hua Clan who was like a woman. That person had been crippled by Qing Shui and was no longer a man anymore. He had no idea if this person was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Right now, the Hua Clan calls the shots in Linhai City. Moreover, that Second Young Master from the Hua Clan, after beaten by you back then, went through a huge change in his temperament. He must have encountered some kind of fortunate event and now his cultivation is terrifyingly high. Furthermore, he is someone the Great Confucian Empire favors and his words carry weight in the Great Confucian Empire as well." After he said this, Lan Lingfeng appeared increasingly strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, not many people knew that the Second Young Master of Hua Clan had been crippled by Qing Shui. Even now, it was probably still the same. It was because Second Young Master Hua would still occasionally snatch women from others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What did you do to him back then? I heard that you crippled his cultivation. Now, not only does he look like a woman, but he also behaves weirdly, wearing a blood red long dress all the time. If one isn't aware that he's the Second Young Master Hua, they would think that he's a woman. Furthermore, not only does he snatch women, those who had been seized by him would all end up dead, covered in scratches and bite marks. He's really a pervert." Yin Tong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Back then, when I crippled his cultivation, I also crippled his manhood." Qing Shui replied awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were quite a number of young ladies around and when they heard what Qing Shui said, they sputtered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother, you're really vicious. I was wondering, how come Second Young Master Hua's temperament would change so drastically. To think that it's because he's been holding it in."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Ziche Sha twisted his ears, "If you continue to say such indecent stuff, I'll twist it off."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Ziche Sha didn't specify what she would twist off, one wouldn't think that it would be his ears, but rather, his bottom part. Lan Lingfeng shuddered and unknowingly clamped his legs tightly together. This made Yin Tong and Qing Shui understood what she meant and the two of them couldn't help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I had crippled his Dantian. It seems that there are really amazing people in this world or some kind of miraculous medicine that can recover his abilities. Just that I have no idea whether his body has recovered." Qing Shui wondered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Allowing his Dantian to recover and his abilities to improved tremendously are already a heaven-sent encounter. He can dream on if he still wishes for that to be healed!" Lan Lingfeng couldn't help but interrupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Ziche Sha didn't say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, let's not talk about this anymore. Let's talk about what actually happened. Could it be that just a Second Young Master Hua himself has the ability to suppress this place?" Qing Shui felt that the world was really full of surprises. The opportunities one encountered would also be considered a type of great luck. He had no idea if Second Young Master Hua should feel happy or sad. Even if he had gained unrivaled martial prowess, he had already lost his manhood...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"With his ability, he can kill everyone here. However, it is a fact that he doesn't do it. He said that he wanted to wait until you've returned and that he wants you to witness us being tortured to our deaths. Furthermore, he won't let anyone around you off." Lan Lingfeng felt depressed as he said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You guys can't win against him even after joining forces... It seems like he's really strong."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the few ladies with curiosity. He knew that the ladies had come here before and under normal circumstances, Second Young Master Hua shouldn't appear. However, he soon realized it. Right now, Second Young Master Hua no longer had the ability to toy with women. This was also possibly a reason why he hadn't appeared. Of course, it could also be because he didn't happen to be in Linhai City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt scared just at the thought of it. If the Second Young Master Hua went crazy and massacred the people here, even he wouldn't know what would happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also had no idea how the ladies would compare to the Second Young Master Hua. The events this time around made even Qing Shui felt surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, don't be careless. He is really strong and his stances are extremely weird. His weapons are two blood-colored claws and they aren't very big when put on. However, they can destroy everything. Neither myself nor Lingfeng has the ability to retaliate." When Yin Tong saw that Qing Shui didn't seem to care much about it and quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Qing Shui was astonished. Both Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng couldn't retaliate at all. What kind of concept was this? One move... to be able to determine the victor with just one move... This profligate could reach the top from being a cripple so quickly? How powerful was he?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A crisp bird's cry that was also like a phoenix's cry rang out. Yin Tong looked into the distance, "Seems like they've been keeping an eye on your traces. They're here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hadn't expected them to come so fast either. It seemed that the Second Young Master Hua harbored great hatred toward him. This was very normal. Back then, Qing Shui had been really vicious and crippled his manhood. No matter who was in his shoes, they would also fight it out with him. Moreover, Second Young Master Hua now had the ability to fight back. How could he possibly get rid of the hatred in his heart if he didn't give it a try?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, the Second Young Master Hua was someone who viewed his lust as strongly as his own life. For him to have suddenly lost his manhood, it was even harder to bear than to take his life. He had no shortage of beautiful women around him, but he could only watch their beautiful figures. Even if they were to lay on the bed, completely undressed, he wouldn’t be able to do anything...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would rather die than to put through such agony. Right now, all the women who dared to seduce him were all tortured to death. The same fate went to those who didn't look at him. Right now, his temperament was very weird. People who dared to cast him weird looks would find themselves in trouble. His voice even sounded a little effeminate. Although he was powerful and could change his voice, without men's Yang energy, no matter how he tried to change, it would still sound strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other party has gotten near, Qing Shui saw that it was a very big bird that looked like a phoenix and was extremely majestic. Although it looked like a phoenix, it also had some resemblance to a dragon. This made Qing Shui very astonished. To think that it was a rare Phoenixcloud Dragon Beast—a type of Phoenix but had some abilities of a dragon, with both aspects perfectly merged together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the person who stood out the most. It was the person at the front with a tall and slender figure. The person was wearing a blood red long dress and had his beautiful hair tied up. This person was definitely a great beauty, but Qing Shui sensed some kind of familiar feeling coming from this person. If Yin Tong and the others hadn’t told him earlier, Qing Shui would not have thought that this was a guy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second Young Master Hua was so beautiful that he was like a woman in the past. Now that he no longer had any Yang energy and was wearing the female clothings, he was really no different from a lady. This made Qing Shui thought of an expert from this previous life—Dongfang Bubai [1]!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw the brand new Second Young Master Hua looking at him. Although there was great fury in Second Young Master Hua's eyes, it was still within control. That fury seemed to be one that was very rational. Just based on this alone, Qing Shui knew that he must not underestimate him. The hardest thing to control was one's emotion. It was not an easy thing for him to be able to control his emotions, especially after what that had happened between them—something that was no less severe than if Qing Shui had killed Second Young Master Hua's parents.</span></p>
