 <p><strong>AST 1167 - The Powerful Four Elements Greencloud Sword</strong></p>
 <p>From there, Qing Shui continued carving. Although he kept on failing, he was able to get a sense of how it should be each time and then he would cross this barrier.</p>
 <p>Time passed by unknowingly. When a five-colored light ray was emitted, Qing Shui let out an exhalation. He looked at the longsword which was ordinary to begin with but now was flowing with colorful lights and felt a great sense of satisfaction.</p>
 <p>It was a success!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this valuable Four Elements Long Sword.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>Four Elements Metallic Sword. Increases user’s strength by threefold and increases a small amount of spirit energy. It has a 20% chance of doubling the prowess of the user’s attacks and a 10% chance that there would be an effect which might be either Gloom Covering Skies and Earth, Fire Snakes Frenzied Dance, Fly Sand Rolling Stones or the Soaring Dragon Sea Quake. Its impact would be affected by the sword’s size and the cultivator’s abilities.</p>
 <p>This sword was made from poor materials and could spoil easily. Diamond or other materials could be added to strengthen it!</p>
 <p>Carving these Seal Formations was actually so that the powers from these four talismans could be unleashed. The success rate was still 10%. 10% wasn’t considered low. There would be an average of one hit out of ten tries. However, it would also be possible for there to be two consecutive successes or even the possibility that there wasn’t a single success even after 30 or 50 attempts.</p>
 <p>Diamonds weren’t considered the most top notch and precious, but they were still very valuable. At least, Qing Shui didn’t have any diamonds on hand. However, these things could be purchased. It was just that they could only be acquired through trade and he would need to get them through connections.</p>
 <p>As for adding other things, Qing Shui felt that the golden extract essence and 10,000 Year coldsteel weren’t bad either. However, the diamond should be absolutely necessary. After all, this was something which must be added since it had been actually refined for that.</p>
 <p>Just to be safe, Qing Shui once carved several swords. As they said, one would be unfamiliar at the first attempt, familiar at the second attempt and become a master at the third attempt. Qing Shui carved on over ten swords, each taking him about half a day. His determination was really strong.</p>
 <p>He took a break, had some food and after he was well rested, he carved on another sword to warm up before he worked on carving on the Greencloud Sword.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui wasn't considered to be well-trained in this, he had gained familiarity in the process through his practice. If there were no accidents, he shouldn't fail.</p>
 <p>When the familiar five-colored lights flashed again, it wasn't just five-colored lights. Including the sword's body itself, it was six-colored lights. In that moment, the colorful glow was brilliant. Qing Shui finally relaxed. The glow this time was more brilliant than ever.</p>
 <p>He has succeeded!</p>
 <p>After the glow on the sword's body disappeared, it became rustic looking. The bit of golden extract essence, 10,000 Year coldsteel, violet jade and other materials which had been added in at the point of forging couldn't be seen. Right now, there were only some ancient runes on the surfaces which exuded a world weary aura. The entire sword appeared rustic and impressive, bearing a silvery grey color.</p>
 <p>It looked very nice and could be used by both males and females. Qing Shui quickly looked toward this brand new weapon!</p>
 <p>Four Elements Greencloud Sword!</p>
 <p>It was forged by repeated tempering of Greencloud Stone, Thunder Rock and other materials. The useless residues were removed during the tempering process, refining the energies from the Greencloud Stone, Thunder Rock and other materials.</p>
 <p>It increases the user's strength by five fold, spirit energy by twofold and there was a 20% chance that the prowess of the user's attacks would be doubled, even for spirit energy attacks. There was also a 10% chance that there would be an effect which might be either Gloom Covering Skies and Earth, Fire Snakes Frenzied Dance, Fly Sand Rolling Stones or the Soaring Dragon Sea Quake. Its impact would be affected by the sword’s size and the cultivator’s abilities.</p>
 <p>The depletion of the user would be reduced by 20% when using this sword.</p>
 <p>It was only now that the sword could be called the Four Elements Greencloud Sword. The sword had been completed. Qing Shui couldn't help but want to try it out, but he didn't do so. That was because some weapons were very strange. After one person had used it, for a very long period of time in the future, it could be such that the other users of the sword might not be able to wield it well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dismissed this thought. Thinking of this made him want to laugh. It was because it was akin to a virgin female, whereby the first time was very important. Legendary grade weapons and divine artifacts seemed to all have this aspect to them, which was to recognize their owners. It was as if they would be stamped with the ownership label after they had recognized their first owner.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui could only try out those which had been forged by ordinary metallic essence. He rose into mid-air and tried to use them, slowly channeling his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique in the swords. The metal swords which appeared to be a little rustic now had a hint of glow but it was very minute.</p>
 <p>Basic Sword Techniques!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui practiced stance after stance and very quickly, over ten moves were completed. However, there was still no sign of the "Four Elements". Just as Qing Shui was distracted, a strong ripple suddenly appeared on the tip of the sword!</p>
 <p>Hssss!</p>
 <p>Several tens of thick and huge fire snakes appeared over ten meters before the sword, instantly forming something that was like a cage made of the fire snakes. The sounds and energy exuded caused one's heart to beat faster.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped, feeling very satisfied. The entire process from the point of the energy fluctuation to the appearance of the fire snakes was very short but it did occur. If one could notice this beforehand and excelled in speed, they might be able to avoid being hit fatally. However, it would be very hard to escape from the attack unscathed.</p>
 <p>Overall, it was considered to be quite a powerful weapon. Putting down the sword in his hands, he checked out the sky. Unknowingly, it was already about time for him to head out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui washed up and had a change of clothes. He was in a good mood. He had gotten a lot stronger and he could also reforge his Big Dipper Sword later. It might be able to increase his abilities to the level of the lowest grade State Master.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know if it was still possible for him to power up his Big Dipper Sword further. He felt that right now, it was very easy for him to forge weapons which could increase one's strength by fourfold and he would need some luck to make weapons which increased one's strength by five fold. It was just like when he was helping Yan Jinyu to forge the Four Elements Greencloud Sword. He had just attained a breakthrough to the Hexa-color Rainbow Art of Forging and thus the attributes to this sword were considered very good. Right now, it would be very hard for Qing Shui to forge another Four Elements Greencloud Sword which was exactly the same. It would take some luck.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Qing Shui had always been one to be considered quite lucky. This was a mysterious ability. Rather than luck, it would be better referred to as Qing Shui's abilities!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was already day outside but it was still early. Qing Shui went for his morning practice but when he arrived at the backyard, he saw that a lady was already there, dancing with her sword.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu!</p>
 <p>Her weapon was a longsword and her sword moves were very mysterious. It wasn't light and agile, nor was it a sword dance. Her sword moves were very strange, it was as if each attack had its own unique feeling. It was as if they held the powers of the world.</p>
 <p>This was a feeling, borrowing the force from the world. It was like if one stood in a high place and looked afar, while one's vision might not actually have become better, the person would be able to see further away. This was what it meant by borrowing force. It was a mental state and was commonly seen. However, there were different levels to it. Using weapons was also one way to do that but it was considered a minor form. What Yan Jinyu was doing was a major form. Legends had it that powerful experts could crush mountains and rivers with a wave of their hands, borrowing the aura and pressure from the world, flipping seas and great rivers. They could even knock down the stars in the skies.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu turned to look at Qing Shui, smiled, nodded and returned to her sword practice. Qing Shui, on the other hand, continued to look Yan Jinyu while she was doing her sword practice, as he casually practiced his Taichi Fist.</p>
 <p>He had already reached quite a good level in this area but it seemed that he was still not comparable to Yan Jinyu. The only thing he could bring out in this area was his Taichi but it was still a far cry from Yan Jinyu's.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui was very happy. It was because he seemed to have sensed something new. Therefore, while he practiced his Taichi Fist, he continued to sense Yan Jinyu's aura and the charms she was exuding.</p>
 <p>These were things which couldn't be picked up and required one's individual comprehension. Qing Shui had already gotten to the level of introduction and had even gotten some comprehension. Unknowingly, the fist force he was demonstrating was getting increasingly stronger.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Taichi mental state had just increased and was still in the phase where he was required to stabilize it. Right now, he finally seemed to have stabilized it.</p>
 <p>"The transformation you go through is really unbelievable. From the first time I met you until now, you're at least twice as strong as before." Yan Jinyu put away her sword, walked up next to Qing Shui and said with a weird look.</p>
 <p>"I'm just lucky to have attained some breakthroughs!" Qing Shui smiled and stopped. It was about time anyway.</p>
 <p>"You never speak a word of truth. Let's go get some food and then prepare to head to the inner city!" Yan Jinyu looked at Qing Shui and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"This is for you. Test it out and see if you're satisfied with it!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Four Elements Greencloud Sword and passed it to Yan Jinyu.</p>
 <p>When Yan Jinyu saw the Four Elements Greencloud Sword, her beautiful eyes shone. She liked the rustic Seal Formation prints on it. It appeared to be a little old but was pleasing to the eyes and very sturdy. It wouldn't lose out to any luxurious looking weapons. It had its own impressive aura.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu looked at Qing Shui and then slowly took the sword. When she saw the little bit of glow flowing through the Four Elements Greencloud Sword, she looked at Qing Shui in surprise. Her tender lips opened slightly and Qing Shui could even see her pink and tender tongue. Her shocked expression caused Qing Shui to be stunned.</p>
 <p>This lady was very beautiful. Hers was a serene beauty, not a flamboyant one. However, no one would be able to ignore her. Her existence was one which could unknowingly bring harm to a country and its citizens.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui regained his senses, he saw a faint pink glow on her cheeks. He smiled awkwardly and said, "Elder Sister is so beautiful that it's almost a match for my wife..."</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu was taken aback by Qing Shui's words. Beautiful ladies tended to think highly of themselves. She smiled and looked at Qing Shui, "Is Miss Tantai from Putuo Mountain your wife?"</p>
 <p>"No!" Qing Shui said directly.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, then do you wish to marry her?" Yan Jinyu asked softly.</p>
 <p>"I don't. I already have a lot of wives."</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu: "..."</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu looked at the sword in her hand and turned away from this topic, "This is really surprising. To think that your forging abilities have already reached this level. This sword can allow me to be about the level of a Grade Two State Master."</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu couldn't conceal her excitement. Her previous weapon increased her strength by less than fourfold but now, with the Four Elements Greencloud Sword, her prowess increased by a lot. This additional one fold was really a lot. Moreover, her spirit energy, depletion and four elements all went through a tremendous change.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui told her about the sword's abilities. In fact, Yan Jinyu could also sense most of it, but she wouldn't know about the things like the 四法 unless she tried it for herself.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, this sword is too precious. Sister likes it a lot. Tell me what you need, I'll see if I can satisfy your request." Yan Jinyu gave it some thought and said very seriously.</p>
 <p>"You want to stand on ceremony with me?" Qing Shui smiled as he looked at her.</p>
 <p>"No. I can't bear to return it to you. I'm just very happy. Being your elder sister, I haven't given you anything before but yet you've shown me a lot of kindness." Yan Jinyu said, finding it a little embarrassing.</p>
 <p>"Then you can call me elder brother..."</p>
 <p>"You can go die! Don't even think about it." Yan Jinyu gave Qing Shui a slight punch and said.</p>
 <p>In this moment, a rapturous mood filled the air.</p>
