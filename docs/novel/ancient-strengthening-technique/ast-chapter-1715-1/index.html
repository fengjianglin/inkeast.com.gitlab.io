It was as if a hint of black eerie wind was extending out ceaselessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was a descendant of the ancient Xuan Snake. In the legends, the ancient Xuan Snake was an existence that could engulf the Dragon Tribe. Although the descendants were not as powerful as their ancestor, their bodies still contained the blood that had been bathed in glory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one wasn't capable, they wouldn't dare to be too arrogant. Qing Shui had confidence in himself, and it was the same for Xuan Yun. The latter's weapon was a Snake Spear that was over two Zhangs long and had the width of a person's wrist. It was dark green in color and exuded a piercing scent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scent didn't stink, but it was still unpleasant. Moreover, it was one that could still be felt without inhaling it. It was a smell that would go into a person's body directly, just like the stench that could be found on animals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui frowned. He knew that the Snake Spear must have been tempered using some kind of things. Otherwise, it wouldn't have such a powerful and piercing smell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silver Snake Chaotic Dance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man attacked directly, rushing toward Qing Shui as he was swinging the Snake Spear. The surrounding was instantly filled with small and thin silver snakes that seemed like decorations. Beautiful, yet, filled with a killing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These small silver snakes were all sashaying slightly as if they were dancing. However, Qing Shui knew that they were determined to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One Spear Eliminating Cities!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's Golden Battle Halberd sent out an explosive force without being gaudy. The force pierced out toward the old man, drawing a trajectory in the air, just like a meteor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wherever the Golden Battle Halberd passed by, the small silver snakes would all shatter and disappear. However, they would soon be replaced by other small silver snakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Yun looked at the Golden Battle Halberd which was heading toward him and his countenance turned grim. This attack was very important. It was a test between cultivators in their first battle. Thus, he shouldn't dodge it. This was especially crucial when both parties weren't aware of each other's capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A small and gentle force charged out from the Golden Battle Halberd toward his body, but Qing Shui didn't feel anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This simple attack allowed both parties to know of each other's level. Qing Shui was a notch higher. In an exchange between experts, who was the stronger one wasn’t important. However, if the gap between both parties was huge, then no amount of techniques would be able to salvage the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man's countenance was very grim. He would have never expected that things would turn out this way. In a head-on collision, he would have actually lost to a young man. He found this hard to accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't too surprised. After all, compared to before, he was several times stronger. His strength had grown from the initial 4,000 Dao force to the current level of about 20,000 Dao force. This was an astronomical increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn't sure if this could be considered an unexpected failure. Even though he had previously felt that this young man wasn't an ordinary character, he hadn't expected that Qing Shui was so strong that he could be compared to a demonic existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had initially planned on dealing a blow to Qing Shui but it now seemed that he wouldn’t be able to get anything out of this place despite having his grandson dying here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't one who would refuse to give way just because he was on the side of reason. However, there were some things which one shouldn't budge in. Qing Shui made his move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's violent strength was unleashed without any technique. Waves and waves of his strength were unleashed and his attacking speed was very fast. They were like great billows that would surge up to the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Yun's attacks weren't as powerful as Qing Shui's. Instead, his attacks were more gentle in nature. However, it was a pity that he wasn't as fast as Qing Shui and could only be on the defense. He was the only one who understood the pain he was being put through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Yun clenched his teeth and hung on. Although he wasn't one of the strongest in the Xuan Clan, he still had quite a high status in the clan. If he were to be defeated by a young man like Qing Shui today, the blow to both of him and the Xuan Clan's reputation would be devastating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had carried a huge burden on his back as he battled against Qing Shui. He had the increasing feeling that things weren't going well and he was struck at the shoulder and was sent flying back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui hadn't thought of having the match end in a draw since there wasn't a need for it, he didn't think of killing the old man either. Right now, he didn't want to offend the Xuan Clan, regardless of their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You are not my match. You can leave. I hope that you'll be able to find out soon about who the person trying to pull a fast one on me is."Qing Shui stopped and said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Yun felt extremely bitter inside. If he knew that things would turn out like this, he wouldn't put himself through all of this. This was how humans were. It was one thing for one to be weaker, but it was a fact that he had lost in a fight. The feeling between the two situations was very different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Xuan Yun's mentality, such a simple thing wasn't sufficient to pull him down yet. However, Qing Shui being too young had brought him a lot of pressure, making him feel that he had really grown old and useless. This pressure made him feel worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Yun nodded. He didn't say anything else and left with the other members of the Xuan Clan. Their backs appeared very heavy when they left, especially Xuan Yun's footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sighed. He knew that the matter with the Xuan Clan wouldn't be resolved so easily. When he had so many things on his platter, having one more thing wouldn't make a difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need to worry. We aren't afraid of anyone." As he was thinking this, Qing Hanye walked up next to Qing Shui and said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at this lady of indescribable beauty. When she looked at Qing Shui, who was watching the group depart, she thought that he was worried. Qing Shui smiled and shook his head, "I'm only a little worried for you guys."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You don't always have to be worried about us. Jiange and I have been here for very long before you came. It's fine. There is a mysterious pattern or regulation in the natural world. Otherwise, all life would be wiped out." Qing Hanye smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that what she had said made sense. Before he had arrived, it was true that she had been living here. However, it wasn't the same for Yiye Jiange and the others. Moreover, Qing Shui thought of the matter concerning the Watermoon Cavern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If I didn't come, how would you deal with the matter concerning the Watermoon Cavern?" Qing Shui seemed very curious about this question.</span></p>

If things really came down to that, I won't be afraid of death. If I can escape, I'll make sure to have them pay back ten or even 100 times." Qing Hanye said with certain before looking at Qing Shui.</span></p>

It's very good." Qing Shui knew about some of Qing Hanye's background. Everyone had their own reverse scales and there were some things which couldn't be changed by external forces.</span></p>

Would there be a day where you'll give me away? If it means that you'll be able to protect everything else that you have now?" Qing Hanye didn't turn her head and asked in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. Qing Hanye's question might seem silly, but such events were common in this world. For the sake of survival, something like this was nothing.</span></p>

At this moment, he realized that she was very lonely.</span></p>
