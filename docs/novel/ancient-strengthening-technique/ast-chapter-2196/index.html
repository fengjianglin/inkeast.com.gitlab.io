Although they were all adults, the temptation of martial arts was the biggest. At the same time, they were thankful to Qing Shui for generously sharing the good stuff with them; not every single man would do that.</span></p>

They wouldn’t be able to make use of the pagodas if Qing Shui was not around.</span></p>

Now, they would never believe anything from anybody else. They remembered what the old Golden Battle God had said as the elderly had better judgments.</span></p>

Even Beihuang Yu felt inferior to Qing Shui now and took him as the leader.</span></p>

Its grade doubled in the Treasure Basin and was now equal to two hundred Divine Square Cauldrons. However, he wondered if he should use it directly. If it could only be used after being refined into Divine Square Cauldrons, it would be troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After trying, Qing Shui was contented. He could use it directly; Qing Shui upgraded the Divine Weapon Flying Sword instantly without further ado.</span></p>

Since the Divine Continent Magical Stone equaled two hundred Divine Square Cauldrons, he upgraded the Flying Sword to the thirteenth grade, leaving behind one-third of the Divine Continent Magical Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The twelfth-grade upgrade required sixty-four Divine Square Cauldrons while the thirteenth grade required a hundred and twenty-eight Divine Square Cauldrons.</span></p>

But Qing Shui had the Hundred Treasure Chest too, so he could strengthen that particular item again. The Hundred Treasure Chest changed its ability: it would double the grade of the treasure if only one item was placed. When two or more items were placed, there would be a transformation, engulfment or destruction of one or more items.</span></p>

It was a small increment, but it was better than nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's strength improved greatly now.</span></p>

So, he could explode with 5.4 billion Dao Force worth of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His current base defensive power was also 5.4 billion dao, and then added with the amplification of 10x from the Foolish Loyalty, it turned up to be 54 billion dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Counting the effect of his Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda of Defense, which increased 20% of his existing defense, Qing Shui's defense was around 64.8 billion dao with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Last but not least, Qing Shui had the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda with the 5.4 billion dao blocking power. Therefore, he had roughly 70 billion dao of defensive power in total.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, his strength increased a lot, especially for the defensive power. Qing Shui's Stellar Transposition also became much stronger. And with the Buddha Diamond Seal, it could cause a maximum damage of 70 billion dao. Plus, it was an unmitigated attack! Although it was only applicable in every several minutes, it was sufficient. It was adequate enough to use it once when the opportunity arose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the Divine Weapon Realm. The fourteenth-upgrade of the Flying Sword required two hundred Divine Square Cauldrons and fifty Divine Weapon Crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And that was the required amount after using the effect of the Treasure Basin; it would be more than these otherwise. It went on without saying that the Flying Sword possessed extraordinary power, ability, and performance, but it had its own shortcoming which was the increased difficulty in upgrading its realm. The damaging prowess of the opponent would be greatly reduced with every upgrade it had. Now, the Flying Sword could even reduce 23% of the damage, it was terrifying! Besides, it had the extra blocking power and could increase the recovery rate of the user.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Weapon, Flying Sword could increase the recovery rate of Qing Shui by 13%; this was crucial in sustaining his battle capability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was already bright outside of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. The others already woke up as Qing Shui was coming out. The Hill Moving Battle God and Diamond were practicing the Yu Emperor Fist. Beihuang Yu was honing his Windwhisk Willow, while the three elders were practicing another fist technique and were about to finish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, Beihuang Fan returned. She had trained in a quiet place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For today, they decided to try their luck nearby. Though they had explored far enough in this trip, they still carried on with high hopes, knowing that it all depended on luck. A treasure hunt was different from a raid, where the strength was the most vital thing to possess. Of course, some treasures were guarded by the Guardian Beast. In that case, strength would have a role to play.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group walked along the path into the mountain. Qing Shui knew there were no powerful demonic beasts here anymore, as the two stronger beasts were already killed by him. Hence, he was not too worried. And besides, he was stronger now that the Divine Weapon had already achieved the thirteenth grade. It was faster, greater, and more destructive than ever. He had tried it in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fire Roots!</span></p>

Qing Shui moved it into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. This was the spiritual grass with fire attributes; it could be added into the medicine refinement or become the ingredient of some pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many herbs in this place, and they were quite decent despite not being the greatest treasure. In fact, they were very useful for Qing Shui.</span></p>
