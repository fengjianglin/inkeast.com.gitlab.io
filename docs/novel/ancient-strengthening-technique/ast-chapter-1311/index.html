 <p><strong>AST 1311 - Stepping into the Great Northern Dynasty, Tanggu Mountain, Are Humans Innately Good or Evil?</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t think twice when he started his massacre. There were some people whom he could leave alone whereas there were also some whom he must get rid of totally. “If you cut the weeds without digging up their roots, they'll grow again when the spring breeze blows”. Originally, he used to disagree with such statement. But it has always been said that “Don’t get family members involved in any personal matters”, this was Qing Shui’s bottom line. If someone was to touch it, he wouldn’t hesitate to get rid of them.</p>
 <p>It was a one-sided slaughter. Qing Shui operated his strength all the way to its peak. Without having the formations to protect them, the people from Beitang Clan and Silver Lion King Dynasty could only suffer the fate of being massacred helplessly by Qing Shui. The two strongest old men from Silver Lion King Dynasty died in the most cowardly way. They were controlled by the Violet Lightning Strike of the Thunderous Beast and got their head burst open immediately by Qing Shui and died.</p>
 <p>With the support provided by the Spirit Gathering Lamp, the Thunderous Beast became even stronger.</p>
 <p>Even though the Fire Bird’s Underworld Fireball wasn’t able to successfully instantly kill the enemies, it has still managed to deal quite considerable damage to them. One after another, the fireball continued to strike down the demonic beasts. Quite a lot of the warriors were also unable to withstand the strike.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Thunderous Beast was gracefully unleashing its Thunderbolt attacks. From time to time, violet thunder would also be seen. The Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider on the other hand, it immediately controlled more than ten of the demonic beasts and warriors from Beitang Clan. These warriors weren’t really that strong. After all, it’s only a minority of them that were considered to be powerful. Now, most of them had already been slaughtered by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Beitang Yizong was still alive. His heart was bleeding. Beitang Yizong still had one more breath left. He held a lot of grievance while dying and as he saw the elites from his clan getting slaughtered one after another, his heart felt as if it was being cut by knives.</p>
 <p>This was a disaster for Beitang Clan. A disaster which fell upon Beitang Clan out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>“It’s always said that do not get one’s family involved in personal matters. Originally, I never had the intention to eliminate all of you. But it seems to me it’s more like you guys are digging graves for yourselves. Even back when I was in the five continents, I also didn’t kill every single one of the members from Beitang Clan.</p>
 <p>“Even if you didn’t kill them, they all still died. You killed warriors from Beitang Clan, leaving behind only fragile children and widows to be bullied by others. Stop pretending to be nice, just kill us if you want.” Beitang Yigong said while revealing a miserable smile.</p>
 <p>Actually, the Beitang Clan back in the five continents had never been in their eyes. This was an issue of pride. If they had known that things would turn out this way, they would rather have pretended to not know anything about the Beitang Clan from the five continents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned silent. Beitang Yigong was telling the truth. He might not have killed Bo Le, but he really died because of him.</p>
 <p>“There are still other people from Beitang Clan. Do you know why Beitang Clan was able to develop so quickly? It was because other than the five continents and Western Oxhe Continent, there are still other Beitang Clan members in the other continents. Even the Beitang Clan from Western Oxhe Continent isn’t something which you can deal with.” Beitang Yigong finished talking. Like just now, he was still laughing miserably. His voice became softer and softer…… Eventually, it disappeared.</p>
 <p>There was blood all over Qing Shui’s body like an Asura. The him at the moment was no different from a murderous god. The Beitang Clan from Lion King’s Ridge has managed to come up as the top within the five continents. It’s strength was also top notch within Western Oxhe Continent. And now, Beitang Yigong has said that there were also Beitang Clan within the other three continents. Hearing that, Qing Shui shook his head. He looked towards the last remaining ten people. They were just like an arrow that’s already at the end of its flight.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the entire area turned quiet. Nothing was left around the area. The corpses of demonic beasts and humans had long since dropped onto the ground. They were all piled up like a mountain at the bottom. The hundreds of demonic beast’s as well as human’s corpses instantly blocked the entire path below.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned around and walked into the direction towards Fa Ying and the others. At this moment, the eyes of all the monks from Great Golden Buddha Temple when they looked at Qing Shui changed. Just how strong was he? The enemies whom Fa Ying was unable to stand for three rounds had mostly been instantly wiped out by this very young man. Furthermore, he managed to do it within half an hour. Just like this, the hundred of powerful warriors all went down.</p>
 <p>Human lives are very fragile. Regardless of how strong a person had been, so long as they ran into someone more powerful, their life would become extremely fragile.</p>
 <p>“Master, why don’t we go down first!” Seeing that they were all lost in their thought, Qing Shui had no choice but to speak up.</p>
 <p>By the time they went down, the people from Great Golden Buddha Temple had already started handling the corpses. Qing Shui on the other hand, went off to take a bath and changed his clothes. The massacres from before had somehow still made him become aware of a lot of things. This was quite a good real action battle.</p>
 <p>After changing into a new cloth, Qing Shui helped Fa Ying cured his injuries. Even though they hadn’t fully healed yet, it had recovered by more than fifty percent. So long as he rested well, they would recover within ten days to half a month. This made them felt all the more surprised and curious with Qing Shui. The reason being that his medical expertise was absolutely powerful.</p>
 <p>“Master, are you aware that there are still other clan members of Beitang Clan in the other three continents?” Qing Shui asked after he collected back his needles.</p>
 <p>“I have never heard about it before. I am also not sure whether they are saying it just to put pressure on Mister Qing or they are telling the truth.” Fa Ying also heard what Beitang Yigong said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also having the same thought. However, he wasn’t really worried. Even if there were people in the other three continents, so what? It’s not that the people in the other three continents were all extremely powerful warriors. The majority of them was still commoners. For now, the most important thing was to deal with Great Northern and Silver Lion Dynasties.</p>
 <p>“Master, then how many more powerful warriors are there in Beitang Clan from Great Northern Dynasty?” Qing Shui wanted to make preparations in advance.</p>
 <p>“The people here today should be only half of the most powerful warriors from their clan. Hence, there must still be powerful warriors left in their clan. Nevertheless, there would definitely not be as many of them left. There might still be warriors keeping watch of the clan, they might even be stronger than the strongest members whom he met today.” Fa Ying said seriously while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Master, I am planning to let Great Qi Dynasty conquer Great Northern Dynasty and Silver Lion Dynasty. What’s your opinion on this? The Great Golden Buddha Temple can assist us in it. By then, we will also get to develop Buddha Sect according to the situation. What do you think?” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Fa Ying looked at Qing Shui. He seemed a bit agitated. But eventually, he still let out a sigh after quite a while, “I plan to do that too. But I feel like I am a bit incapable of swallowing them.”</p>
 <p>“How would you know if you don’t try?” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>When Fa Ying heard Qing Shui’s words, he also revealed an excited expression on his face. He then nodded his head after contemplation. He knew that once Qing Shui said it this way, he would assist them from behind. Things would turn out to be a lot easier this way.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stayed for one more night at the Great Golden Buddha Temple. He was preparing to set off for Great Northern and Silver Lion Dynasty tomorrow. Originally, he visited this time with the intention to only check things out with Great Northern Dynasty and plan out his next move. But as it seemed, it seemed like he has already started making his move before he even arrived in Great Northern Dynasty.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui has killed people many times. But after the massacre this time, he still felt a little exhausted. These people were all top notch existences within Western Oxhe Continent. Furthermore, there were so many of them. Despite this, things hadn’t ended here.</p>
 <p>The entire night turned out to be quite peaceful. Originaly, Qing Shui had thought that the people from Beitang Clan and Silver Lion Dynasty would come to him. But turned out they didn’t. Qing Shui also wasn’t scared that they would run away. They’re an entire dynasty, as if it would be that easy for them to escape. Furthermore, it’s not difficult for Qing Shui to track down someone. He had Lotus Sect, Putuo Mountain, Heaven Secrets Academy, and the many dynasties under Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>………..</p>
 <p>On the next day, Qing Shui bid his farewell and made his way towards Great Northern Dynasty. He wanted to annihilate whatever existences of Beitang Clan which resided within Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>Great Northern Dynasty!</p>
 <p>In the Western Oxhe continent, there were only very few dynasties which were above third grade. At least this was what it seemed from the surface. Whereas for the Great Northern Dynasty, its actual grade has always been quite unclear. There were people who said that it was a Grade One dynasty. There were also some who said that it was a Grade Two or a Grade Three Dynasty. In fact, there were some who even commented that it was not inferior to Grade Four Dynasties.</p>
 <p>Through actual combat, these people have already achieved strength equivalent to Grade Four Dynasties. Originally, when Qing Shui first arrived in Western Oxhe Continent, he already heard that there were only three forces with Grade Four strength. But these were strength from a long time ago. As for now, it was not known how many forces there were with Grade Four strength. In fact, it was not even known whether there was any Grade Five forces.</p>
 <p>Hence, up to this point, Qing Shi was already aware that the strength of Western Oxhe Continent wasn’t as simple as it seemed from the surface. Two years ago, Qing Shui has also walked only the tip of the iceberg of Western Oxhe Continent. It’s impossible for him to thoroughly go through every single part of the continent. Even if he had done so, hen still wouldn’t be able to fully discover all of the forces.</p>
 <p>Human’s life was like a journey. Everyone had their own path set for themselves. There were millions and millions of paths across the world. And only very few paths would intersect with your own. Its distance was also quite limited. The scenery which they could see was also only a part of the scenery of the path which they crossed with. People at different levels had different kind of life. But more of those were two parallel lines. Without any intersection, they wouldn’t know what level their life was.</p>
 <p>Beitang Clan was the royal clan of Great Northern Dynasty. Hence, it was quite easy to locate it. Qing Shui didn’t go to the palace. The splendorous palace itself was just a symbol, something to symbolize the royal clan. The real Beitang Clan was located on top of a high mountain near the palace itself.</p>
 <p>Tanggu Mountain!</p>
 <p>This mountain was at least ten thousand meters above sea level. Across the World of the Nine Continents, there were countless mountains that were more than ten thousand meters above sea level. It could be seen almost everywhere. Unlike in his previous incarnation, the tallest mountain was only eight thousand meters tall.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately flew towards the peak of the mountain on top of the Fire Bird. Before he reached the mountain peak, around ten flying demonic beasts already appeared above. They were all Gold Lion King Eagle. By now, Qing Shui was also already able to see some of the things going on on top of the mountain.</p>
 <p>The peak of the mountain was covered in mist and clouds like it was a paradise. Steady courtyards and pavilions could be seen standing firmly on top of it. The mountain peak was very wide. The ground was levelled and there were a lot of plants around it as well. On top of that, there was even a spot which had a huge hot spring.</p>
 <p>This time, around fifty Gold Lion King Eagle came out. For a moment, the sky shook from the lion’s roaring noises.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at all of these people. They were all seniors who were already beyond their sixties. Their actual age was even older than that. They were definitely able to be considered as old demons. Qing Shui circled around them with his vision but surprisingly, he only fixed his sight on an old man who didn’t seem like the oldest one among the group.</p>
 <p>The reason being that the old man had very powerful Spiritual Sense and aura. Other than that, it was also because the old man has already stepped into the huge gate of Heavenly Dao. Normally, a reaction would happen between two people who stepped into the huge gate of Heavenly Dao. If nothing unexpected happened, they should be able to sense it unless the two were too far apart from each other. There were also some other factors which might contribute to them not sensing it.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui, the old man’s eyes turned extremely bright. He stared at Qing Shui very firmly.</p>
 <p>“What a demon, it seems that the Beitang Clan is destined to die in your hands.” The old man appeared on a spot not far away from Qing Shui and spoke slowly.</p>
 <p>“I was left with no choice. Beitang Clan didn’t comply with the rules as warriors. Originally, I never had the intention to do things like this. But Beitang Clan has truly made me unable to restrain myself from doing so.” Qing Shui looked at the old man and explained slowly. The old man’s strength was very frightening. Even though it wasn’t as strong as the woman from Putuo Mountain, there was only a small difference between their gap in strength.</p>
 <p>“I won’t judge on who is right or who is wrong regarding this matter. Everything is decided by strength alone. With strength, even if someone had been on the wrong, they would still be considered to be right.” The old man looked really firm. He emitted a decisive aura.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and shook his head, “The winner becomes the king, whereas the loser becomes the bandit. Devils rebel against the gods. They don’t do things according to natural laws. This way, they can only stay arrogant for so long. In the end, even if they’re not killed, they will still die in their own hands.”</p>
 <p>“Humans are inherently good, or are they inherently bad? It is all decided with a twist in mind. There are a lot of natural laws. Everyone has their own different versions of it. There is Nature Energy, so is there monstrous Demonic Energy. With a heart that pursues justice, there will be a heart that pursues evil. As long as one is able to keep their own sanity and not lose themselves, it doesn’t matter whether they are good or bad.”</p>
 <p>“Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs. Even the evilest person in the world will still feel love for their family. They will still have their own bottom line and their own shortcoming. This comes to conclude that humans are inherently good.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man.</p>
