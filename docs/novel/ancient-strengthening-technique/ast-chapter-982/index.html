 <p><strong>AST 982 - The Blissful Zhu Qing, Lovers Who Are Finally United By Marriage</strong></p>
 <p>They hadn't met for very long, but they were very close, and they were almost as close as kin. At least, to Qing Shui, Baili Jingwei was very important. No matter what, both Qing Shui and Qing Clan were indebted to Baili Jingwei. Additionally, to Yiye Jiange, this relationship was priceless. They would never be able to repay them.</p>
 <p>Everyone chatted and Qing Shui handed Baili Jingwei an Interspatial Silk Sachet, and said while smiling, "There are things in there which you guys need here and there is also some stuff for Wufeng as well."</p>
 <p>Baili Wufeng was Baili Jingwei's one and only grandchild, his closest kin. However, the others were also his Martial Brothers and were like his real brothers. Zhu Qing was their Martial Sister and Yiye Jiange was the last one who had joined the ranks.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, there's no need to stand on ceremony," Baili Jingwei said as he looked at the Interspatial Silk Sachet.</p>
 <p>Although this Interspatial Silk Sachet was nothing to Qing Shui, those who were below the Martial Saint level would basically be unable to possess one, unless they came from aristocrat or major clans. Thinking about this, Qing Shui took out a few more Interspatial Silk Sachets and passed it to them.</p>
 <p>"Old Master, the one I gave you contains some items which would be good for Skysword Sect's development. After all, I am an Elder of Skysword Sect's in name. The Interspatial Silk Sachets for the others contain some medicine. The Skysword Sect still needs you to lead them to prosperity."</p>
 <p>"Then I won't stand on ceremony." Baili Jingwei was very happy. Although he didn't show much surprise on his face, his heart was filled with indescribable joy and surprise. After all, he was already quite old and had experienced quite a lot of things in life, thus he wouldn't go crazy from elation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't see Zhu Qing, but felt a little embarrassed to ask. When Yiye Jiange saw how Qing Shui was acting, she smiled and said, "I didn't see Third Martial Sister. Is she not at Skysword Sect?"</p>
 <p>In fact, Yiye Jiange was also puzzled. Zhu Qing basically never left Skysword Sect and thus she had wanted to ask this too.</p>
 <p>"She is around. It's just that some complications occurred to her when she was practicing her martial arts. Therefore, we didn't inform her." When Baili Jingwei mentioned Zhu Qing, he also frowned, as if he was troubled about something. However, when his eyes landed on Qing Shui, his eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>"I've forgotten that Qing Shui is a great doctor. Go take a look at Zhu Qing!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also stunned when he heard what Baili Jingwei said. It seemed that Zhu Qing's injuries weren't light but weren’t too serious either. He quickly nodded, "I'll go take a look. Wait for my good news!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing Peak!</p>
 <p>Although he hadn't come for very long, Qing Shui was still very familiar with the place. This place no longer forbids men from entering and it was a common sight to see male disciples waiting for people here. It wasn’t rare for a man and woman couple to take a walk here while chatting.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's appearance didn't attract too much attention. Many people just found him unfamiliar but there were too many unfamiliar faces in Skysword Sect. Since there were so many people, it was impossible for an individual to recognize everyone. It was just like how this in Qing Shui's previous world. When people went to school, while they might be able to recognize their classmates, they might not know as many people from the other classes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked into the familiar manor. There weren't any guards here and the door wasn't closed either. He walked into the small quiet courtyard. The rocky surface had a few twisted roads, with plants and trees on each side, releasing a faint fragrance.</p>
 <p>He stepped onto the rocky surface and headed for the entrance to the hall. There weren't many differences from the last time he was here. Before he reached the door, someone walked out.</p>
 <p>A woman!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw that it was Zhu Qing, he was stunned. She was wearing an emerald pleated dress which couldn't hide her wonderful curves. She was a petite lady but she had well-rounded breasts and bosom. She also had a mature and seductive face which would stand out no matter where she went.</p>
 <p>There hadn’t been many changes to her mature and exquisite face. However, when she saw Qing Shui, her mouth opened slightly as she stood there in a daze. Qing Shui smiled and walked over, carrying her up horizontally.</p>
 <p>"Zhu Qing!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried this lady who was much older than he was. She should be about the same age as Lady Duanmu, but the difference was that Lady Duanmu had a daughter. Their ages would be at most thirty if compared to the people from his previous life.</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Qi in the World of the Nine Continents was abundant and Zhu Qing was still in her prime. Therefore, in this world, people judged ladies by her face and abilities. One's abilities could allow them to sustain their youth for a longer of time and delay their aging. There were also top notch skills which could allow one to forever retain their youth. It was just that these techniques were rare and each of them could be seen as a supreme treasure.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, ah, I'm not dreaming!" Zhu Qing hugged Qing Shui and cried out in great surprise.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this docile lady who appeared to be very blissful. He felt very guilty when he saw this mature lady acting so docile. She was the one whom he had given the least to, and yet she felt so satisfied just at the sight of him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried her and sat down on the soft bed. Earlier, he had already discovered that she had hurt her meridian channels in the course of her training. If he hadn't guessed wrongly, she would feel agony every two days. It was because the Qi of Xiantian in her body would run amok.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, why have you come to Skysword Sect?" Zhu Qing rested in Qing Shui's arms, looking at him. From the moment she saw him, her smile had not faded.</p>
 <p>"Stop looking. I'll let you do as you wish at night!" Qing Shui smiled and look at this lady whose face was quickly covered in a red blush.</p>
 <p>"You're not allowed to say something like that. If you say that, you'll have to make sure to fulfill the promise..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's hands were already playing with her well-rounded figure, and he withdrew his hands unwillingly. If this were to continue, he would probably lose his calm right now. He looked at this woman who appeared to be both charming and seductive at this moment.</p>
 <p>"I've missed you. This time around, I'm here to bring you home with me. You're my wife." Qing Shui hugged her and said happily.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing was astonished and looked at Qing Shui with surprise. A hint of a smile flashed in her clear eyes, "Qing Shui, thank you for your kind intentions. I'm already very thankful that you have these thoughts. There's no need to do this..."</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slapped her well-rounded butt hard, causing a layer of mist to appear in Zhu Qing's eyes. She looked at Qing Shui pitifully.</p>
 <p>"You're my woman. If you are to say those things in the future, I'll do the same to you again. A couple will always be on equal grounds, otherwise, there wouldn't be any love and there would only be pity at most. Zhu Qing, what I feel for you is love. I can't explain it, but I know that it's love." Qing Shui rested his head against hers.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing smiled and hugged Qing Shui tightly. She took the initiative to kiss Qing Shui's lips and crazily sought for more. Qing Shui's hands didn't rest and he lifted up her clothes not long after. Her twin peaks jumped out like snow white rabbits.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui buried his face in them and greedily sucked. Suddenly, the door to the bedroom opened. Zhu Qing lifted her head to see Yiye Jiange standing at the door, looking at them in a daze.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui stopped and saw the blushing Yiye Jiange. He said awkwardly, "We're in the midst of treating her injuries..."</p>
 <p>"Next time, lock the door!"</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange threw this line and ran out quickly. The scene of Qing Shui sucking on those snow white breasts kept flashing in her mind, as if it was a curse corroding her body. This caused her to feel weird and she had a strong urge to hold Qing Shui tightly.</p>
 <p>She panicked. The scene was very clear in her mind, and she wasn't able to erase it at all. Her face was burning up and her mind was in a mess. The impact she had experienced from that scene was too great and she was stunned for quite a while before she was able to regain her senses.</p>
 <p>With Yiye Jiange gone, Qing Shui thought of what he said earlier, to give treatment to Zhu Qing...</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing pulled down her clothes and lowered her head. The impact of being seen by Yiye Jiange was too great for her too. She then lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui, her charming eyes had a hint of embarrassment.</p>
 <p>"Come, let me treat your injuries!" Qing Shui smiled and took out a Gold Needle.</p>
 <p>"You knew..."</p>
 <p>"The reason I'm here is to treat you. Jiange probably is here to see if you're feeling better..." Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
 <p>"Jiange? Qing Shui, have you eaten Martial Sister yet?" Zhu Qing looked at Qing Shui with great interest.</p>
 <p>"No!" Qing Shui carried up Zhu Qing and sat her down on the bed.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing smiled and looked at Qing Shui, deep in thought, "Martial Sister likes you. In the future, she'll definitely marry you."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't wish to discuss this problem any further and remained silent. He started to help Zhu Qing treat the part of her meridian channels which had been broken. To Qing Shui, this injury was nothing much, but not many people could heal injuries related to meridian channels and the Dantian. It would be fine if the injuries were light, but if it the meridian channels had been broken or had other serious problems such as a huge degree of shrinkage, multiple holes, or blockage...not many people would be able to provide treatment unless they had some miraculous medicine.</p>
 <p>He got it settled within 30 minutes. Afterwards, he then passed Zhu Qing an Interspatial Silk Sachet, "This is for you!"</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing looked at Qing Shui and smiled, saying, "For me?"</p>
 <p>"Of course it's for you. Put the things you like in here. We'll go home in two days." Qing Shui hung the Interspatial Silk Sachet around her waist and then covered it with her clothes.</p>
 <p>"Mm, I'll let Eldest Martial Brother and Second Martial Brother know." Zhu Qing said happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded. Zhu Qing had always been alone and when they headed back, he hoped that she would be able to blend into Qing Clan and let her lonely heart become alive and happy once again.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Baili Jingwei and the others knew that Zhu Qing had been treated by Qing Shui, they were all very happy. Only Qing Shui, Zhu Qing, and Yiye Jiange appeared especially awkward when their gazes met.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange didn't dare to meet Qing Shui's gaze. Zhu Qing went over and took her hand.</p>
 <p>"Martial Sister, you're really all better now?" Yiye Jiange asked seriously.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange's words didn’t have any hidden intentions, but a hint of a flush appeared on Zhu Qing's face, "Mmm, I'm fine now."</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Zhu Qing then at Qing Shui. She wondered if they were really going through treatment earlier...</p>
 <p>Baili Jingwei and the others didn't know what had happened. Even at his age, Baili Jingwei hadn't been able to tell anything this time around. Or rather, even if he could tell that something was amiss, he couldn't really be sure.</p>
 <p>"Eldest Martial Brother, Second Martial Brother... I'm going to leave Skysword Sect and head to Qing Shui's place." When Zhu Qing brought this up, it seemed to take her a lot of effort.</p>
 <p>With that, Baili Jingwei and the others seemed to be able to tell that something was going on. He looked at her in surprise, then at Qing Shui, "You guys..."</p>
 <p>"Eldest Martial Brother, I'm together with Qing Shui now." Zhu Qing's voice was very soft, but many people around them could hear her clearly.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Baili Jingwei smiled, causing many people to look at him in great surprise. He only looked at Qing Shui after a very long time. "I'm very happy. Tomorrow, we'll hold a banquet in celebration."</p>
 <p>"Alright, when we arrive at the Continent's Capital, I'll hold a wedding banquet. When the time comes, Old Master, you guys will have to come."</p>
 <p>"I don't think I'll be going. I'm assured if Third Martial Sister were to follow you. This is a good surprise as well. Qing Shui, come join me for a walk!" Baili Jingwei said happily.</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Baili Jingwei walked slowly on Skysword Mountain. Qing Shui knew that Baili Jingwei was going to tell him something.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, it's unexpected that you have gotten together with Zhu Qing, but I'm very happy." Baili Jingwei smiled and said.</p>
