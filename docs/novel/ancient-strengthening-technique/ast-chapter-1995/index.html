 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Miaoyun was a handsome and straightforward man. He could already be considered an adult, a matured adult. If it had been in his previous incarnation, he would have had the looks of a person ranging around 35 years old. However, the people here usually looked younger than their actual ages. Added on that he was once a cultivator, the functions across his body would still be very active. This explained why he could look so young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with his cultivation gone, his body naturally no longer had the formidable Origin Qi to nurture it. It shouldn’t take long before his body started to grow old. Recently, Qing Ci had been learning Acupuncture but for now, she was still far away from being able to treat a patient. Hence, she thought for a while and said, “Please wait for a while. I will get my master to come and see you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Miaoyun nodded, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui heard from Qing Ci that a man with an empty Dantian and snapped meridians came, he stood up and said casually, “Let’s go and take a look at him. I can also use this opportunity to demonstrate to you how to treat patients with conditions like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ci was very agitated. She was a cultivator. At one point, she was also like that, but thanks to Qing Shui, she had managed to recover her strength. Hence, today, when she saw Zhang Miaoyun’s conditions, she believed that Qing Shui was able to cure him, which was why she came to look for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than that, she was naturally aware of how tough it was to cure a person with snapped meridians and was under the conditions where they couldn’t gather Origin Qi within their Dantian. Back then, when Qing Shui first cured her of her conditions, she already knew that this person was a person with extraordinary talent. This was the reason why she was willing to put everything at stake just to be his disciple. Other than doing it for herself, she also wanted to make sure that her child could grow up to be a man. The fact that she had actually become his disciple surprised her greatly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was sitting on the seat where Qing Ci was previously at. There were a lot of people around the area. Even though they might be a bit far away, they were still keeping an eye on the things that were going on here. After all, Zhang Miaoyun was quite a popular figure. His illness was also a famous thing around the area. They were eager to know whether or not Qing Shui could cure him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only so, more and more people were also joining the Imperial Cuisine Hall and helping out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that this was the opportunity he was looking for. If he could cure Zhang Miaoyun, the name of Imperial Cuisine Hall would immediately go up by a few levels. In the past, Qing Shui used to not care about false reputations. In fact, this couldn’t be considered a false reputation. Though he used to not care before, now that he was here, he would need reputations up to a certain extent to build a foundation for himself in this area. His reputation played an important role for him to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like always, Qing Shui examined the patient’s pulse. After that, he confidently said, “It can be cured!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although that was all Qing Shui said, he had received a weird look from Zhang Miaoyun. Zhang Miaoyun was in disbelief and thought that he might have heard it wrong. He even started to suspect what he had heard. Nevertheless, he didn’t seem too surprised. To him, unless it was completely cured, he felt that there was nothing for him to be surprised about. He had already become immune to it after failing again and again multiple times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at Qing Shui with doubt, “It can be cured?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, but it will be a bit troublesome to do so.” Qing Shui knew that his problem couldn’t be fixed immediately. If it had been an issue which could be fixed so fast, other people would have thought that it was very simple. Other than that, being able to do so would have also been a bit heaven-defying and defied logic. Hence, even if he wanted to cure it, it would still take some time until he could fully recover. It should take more or less a month. With that in mind, on the first day, Qing Shui must make him feel the effect very clearly so he could have a sense of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t mind troubles. Sir, please help me!” Zhang Miaoyun requested with a serious face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, “Today, I intend to help you gather your Qi but you must find some medicinal herbs for me. Since these things can’t be found that easily, I will draw it out for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui drew the medicinal herbs which he needed him to look for. It also included the Martial Emperor Origin Essence. Qing Shui didn’t have the time to go and look for it, but he believed that Zhang Clan had the ability to do so. In fact, he thought that Zhang Clan might even have collections of it. Hence, Qing Shui didn’t hold back and drew quite a lot of medicinal herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui realized that this was quite a good thing. In the future, if the patient was in a dire situation, he could get them to help him look for medicinal herbs. In any case, these people should have their own ways of attaining it. There would also be people buying them and most importantly, they must have collected quite a lot of those medicinal herbs themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the more medicinal herbs he demanded them to look for and the more precious they were, the higher the hope they would have. They also knew that conditions like this were hard to be treated. Doing so could also help silent people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used his Golden Needles and continuously unleashed his Acupunctures on Zhang Miaoyun. Everyone was amazed by the complex hand movements of his. It even caused a thread of faint golden gas-like substance to form around Zhang Miaoyun. Similarly, Qing Shui also happened to have it in his surroundings. This made him looked like he possessed the Buddha Light Treasure Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, this could be considered as the Buddha’s Qi, the true Buddha Light Treasure Qi. At the moment, Qing Shui was simply amazed by what was going on. When he first started, he had never expected for his Force of Rebirth to combine with the thread of Buddha Qi, causing them to break through to form the real Buddha Light Treasure Qi. This kind of gas was capable of resisting against evil spirits attempting to enter the victim’s body. It also helped cure diseases of various type.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was indeed an unexpected but welcomed surprise. To begin with, Qing Shui’s ability to cure diseases was already very staggering. Now, it got even better. Furthermore, the Buddha Light Treasure Qi was also capable of slowly nurturing one’s organs. It was spread out across different parts of a person’s body, making them function even more efficiently. For example, the bones would become tougher and more elastic. The vitality, endurance, and also ability of the organs to resist against attacks would also increase by two folds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was feeling comfortable like never before. There was an indistinct aura within his body. It was a kind of feeling which words couldn’t describe. It felt a bit refreshing, but at the same time, also contained a bit of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this, Qing Shui’s defensive prowess increased significantly while his body functions reached their peaks as well. This could provide great help for him when he cultivated. It didn’t matter if it was on his speed or progress, they would both improve greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buddha Light Treasure Qi. Things that were known as the Treasure Qi was no doubt, a kind of very precious Qi. It was not that easy for something to have the title ‘treasure’ in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Miaoyun was astonished. The shock which he received was nothing he had experienced before. He could feel his own Dantian gathering up Qi. He managed to recover roughly one-third of his Qi from the past. This was something which he wouldn’t dare to even think about just a few moments ago. Furthermore, his Dantian had even stopped hurting. Before this, not only was it unable to gather up Qi, it was also hurting from time to time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, it seemed that he had recovered completely. He felt a lot more comfortable now. Furthermore, he was also able to gather his Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remember, though you may be able to gather Qi as of now, you mustn’t use them for the first three months. Live your life as a normal person like how you did before. Let me prescribe some medicines for you first so that you can warm and nourish your body. Come back here after three days. It should take about two months until you can fully recover. If the progress goes faster than expected, there’s a small chance that you can recover within a month. But most importantly, you mustn’t revolve your qi within these three months or else, even I may not have another way to help you recover completely.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took back his needles and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, sir!” Zhang Miaoyun took a deep bow before Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui waved his hand, “Remember those medicinal herbs which I mentioned to you before. If not, it will be tough for you to recover back to how you were before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the medicinal herbs which Qing Shui had drawn, a part of it was also those which Zhang Miaoyun must take.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Miaoyun responded quickly, “No problem! Well then, if you will excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lot of people were amazed by Zhang Miaoyun’s expression. Even a fool could tell that the Imperial Cuisine Hall would be able to cure Zhang Miaoyun. They had even witnessed the golden aura from before. News about it had already been spread out. After all, everyone was well aware of the condition Zhang Miaoyun was at.</span></p>

At the same time, the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Qing Shui, Qing Ci, and even the Barbarian Emperor, all of them in just a moment had become the center of attention for a lot of forces within Great Shang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people were happy whereas some were upset. Naturally, the happiest one would be none other than the Zhang Clan themselves. Though the Zhang Clan’s Clan Head Zhang Danfeng might have more than ten children, Zhang Miaoyun was still the most important to him as well as the entire Zhang Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a lot of people in the hall of Zhang Clan. The person with the highest authority was an old man, a wise old man. He was the father of the current Zhang Clan’s Clan Head, Zhang Danfeng. The old man was looking very happy at the moment. Before this, it could be seen that he was happily conversing with the others, but very quickly, his expression changed, “I seemed to have let my guard down. The Imperial Cuisine Hall will definitely be in danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s words immediately caused Zhang Danfeng to change expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a moment, the name of the Imperial Cuisine Hall had traveled far away into the distance. Some people didn’t want to see Zhang Clan prosper and yet, some were very eager to see their success. Some didn’t want the Imperial Cuisine Hall to cure Zhang Miaoyun. The reason was that if even they failed to cure Zhang Miaoyun, no one should be able to do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, I will bring some people along with me to take a look at what’s going on. No matter what, we mustn’t let anything happen to the Miraculous Physician.” Zhang Danfeng was starting to get a bit nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the old man’s face looked more relieved, “Indeed. Maybe this Miraculous Physician truly isn’t scared of getting into troubles.”</span></p>
