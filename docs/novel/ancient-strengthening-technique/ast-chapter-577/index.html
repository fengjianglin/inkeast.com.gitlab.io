 <p><strong><strong>AST 577 - Hundred Forms of the Tiger</strong></strong></p>
 <p>He chatted with Elder Ge for a while in order to grasp what had happened recently in the Heavenly Palace. However, it had just been a short six month, no major events should have occurred.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ge, what is the attribute of the techniques you practice and your body’s attribute?” The Five Elements Fruit in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had matured once again and were harvested.</p>
 <p>“The fire attribute!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui handed him ten fire attributed Five Elements Fruit and left as Elder Ge stared at him in shock!</p>
 <p>Next, Qing Shui went to the Heavenly Palace Treasury, he wanted to check again to see if there were anything that interested him. It was filled with items that the Old Ancestor treasured. However, to Qing Shui, maybe only the deepest layers might hold anything of value to him.</p>
 <p>After arriving at the Heavenly Palace Treasury, he saw the two elders still playing chess there. When they saw Qing Shui, they quickly got up and greeted Qing Shui: “Patriarch, is there anything you need help with?”</p>
 <p>“Elders, please just carry on with what you are doing, I’m just here to look around!” Qing Shui laughed as he greeted them before going in.</p>
 <p>There were not many people inside the Treasury, however, when Qing Shui entered, anyone who saw him would respectfully greet him. Qing Shui would just smile and wave as he made his way to the deeper layers.</p>
 <p>Most of these items were martial skill books or medicinal pills, however, they all had a level restriction. Only those with sufficient contribution points to the Heavenly Palace or those who had reached a certain cultivation realm would be allowed to take them.</p>
 <p>To get contribution points, they could go out to gather herbs, kill Demonic Beasts, protect the reputation of Heavenly Palace or go on a mission for the Heavenly Palace. There were many ways to contribute and the more they contributed, the more they could obtain every month.</p>
 <p>Only when they reached a sufficient level of contribution, could they come to the treasury. Each level would require a different amount of contribution points. Of course, the grade and quality of the items on the different levels would be different too.</p>
 <p>In order to come to the Heavenly Palace Treasury, a token was required. Ordinary disciples rarely had one, the tokens were mostly held by the Heavenly Palace’s elders.</p>
 <p>As the Patriarch of Heavenly Palace, naturally he did not need any contributions, even if he was required, he would have enough. Destroying the Sword Tower or Demonic Beast Sect, just one of them would have earned sufficient contribution points.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not been not interested in the things in front when he had come in the past as he had already seen many of them. Now, Qing Shui was still no longer interested in them, mostly because they could no longer help him.</p>
 <p>Thus, Qing Shui directly descended to the fifth layer and started to look through the items to see if there were anything that he needed. The herbs in the treasury were incomparably better than those in the Heavenly Palace medicinal storehouse.</p>
 <p>.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had seen many of the herbs here before. Back when he was refining the Great Revitalizing Pellet and Wind Water Primordial Pellet, he had looked through all the herbs in the treasury and the medicinal storehouse. Thus, Qing Shui did not even bother to look at those again. After all, none of the herbs required for the Everlasting Pellet were here.</p>
 <p>Two hours later, Qing Shui arrived at the sixth layer and he found many books and paintings. Qing Shui thought of his earlier decision to spend some time to practice drawing, thus he intended to look through this area thoroughly.</p>
 <p>Hiking in spring!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a look but did not feel anything, thus he passed it by!</p>
 <p>Peach blossoms blossoming!</p>
 <p>“En, looks pretty nice……” Qing Shui skipped this again!</p>
 <p>“Mandarin ducks playing in the water, eagles soaring in the sky, fishes in water……” Qing Shui slowly look through the paintings and a few of the books.</p>
 <p>Pride of lions!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw a large painting, its was ten meters wide and long. There was almost a thousand lions, all at a varying depths. Most of them had a clear silhouette, Qing Shui felt that the skill of the artist was great, every lion appeared the same but upon careful examination, they were all different.</p>
 <p>With ten thousand people, there would easily be ten thousand different appearances. However, Qing Shui felt that with lions, just three to five differents ones would be very good already. Despite that there were about a thousand with unique looks, this was true skill.</p>
 <p>After looking for a while, Qing Shui regretted that the lions were all in the just running, they were not hunting or participating in other kinds of actions. If this painting could show the different activities of the lions, then it would be divine.</p>
 <p>Following that, Qing Shui continued to look through hundreds of other paintings. The ones he skipped were mostly paintings of flowers or animals, there were also some calligraphy on Beast Parchment.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Qing Shui moved row by row, heading towards the back!</p>
 <p>Tiger Painting!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took special note of tiger paintings, in front of him was a Leaping Tiger Painting that was a little more than a metre tall and wide. The painting depicted a huge tiger leaping high, despite the relatively small size of the painting, it still caused Qing Shui to feel that the tiger in the painting had an especially large build.</p>
 <p>This was the might of the tiger, it had nothing to do with its size…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept it then continued to move towards the back. There were not many paintings left, he intended to finish looking at them all. He would come back again in the future when he has time.</p>
 <p>Following that, Qing Shui realised that from this row onwards, the paintings were all of tigers. This was not strange because Qing Shui had discovered that everything was arranged by category, to facilitate easy searching.</p>
 <p>“En? What is this?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at a book placed on top of the final bookshelf. It was about an inch thick and coloured a dark gray. There were a few eye catching words on it. When Qing Shui saw those words, his heart could not help but beat faster.</p>
 <p>Hundred Forms of the Tiger.</p>
 <p>The words were a light green color. When Qing Shui picked the book up, he found it was soft like cotton. With a touch, Qing Shui could tell that this beast skin was that of a Martial Saint leveled Demonic Beast. However, due to the passage of time, the Spiritual Qi it emitted had already become very weak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui abandoned these thoughts and slowly opened the book, the first form was Walking Tiger. The first thing that caught Qing Shui’s eyes was that the tiger in the painting was actually a Martial Saint leveled Demonic Beast.</p>
 <p>Golden Eyed Black Flames Tiger!</p>
 <p>The huge tiger in the painting was completely cloaked in a layer of thick black flames, except for its strangely dazzling pair of large golden eyes. Qing Shui had read an introduction to this Golden Eyed Black Flames Tiger in a history book.</p>
 <p>The book claimed that the Golden Eyes Black Flames Tiger’s body was a hundred meters long and its strength was about a Grade Seven Martial Saint. That piece of history happened 300000 years ago, as the depiction of the Golden Eyed Black Flames Tiger seemed strange back then, Qing Shui remembered it very clearly.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui looked at this page, he started to flip over to the next few pages. Running Tiger, Jumping Tiger, Leaping Tiger, Crouching Tiger, Tiger Claws…...</p>
 <p>He finally reached the end of the book. There was a total of a hundred pages and each page depicted a form of the Tiger. As the Heavenly Palace Patriarch, he could just simply take anything he wanted, even if he took everything, no one would dare to say anything. Thus, he directly tossed the Hundred Forms of the Tiger into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>When he came out of the Heavenly Palace Treasury, it was already dark outside. He had already made arrangements to have dinner with everyone, thus he rode the Fire Bird and flew back to the Qing Clan,</p>
 <p>At night, the Qing Clan gathered together once again, even Qing Jiang and Qing He had returned!</p>
 <p>There was a table full of luxurious dishes including some Rainbow Trout Fish. Within half a year, there were already 300,000 young Rainbow Trout Fish, thus he did not have to worry about taking them out for this dinner.</p>
 <p>In another year, it would become impossible to finish eating all of them even if they tried!</p>
 <p>There were was a great variety of seafood and Qing Shui even personally made many nourishing soups that were good for the body. There was even bone strengthening soup which helped with cultivation.</p>
 <p>Other than those from the Qing Clan, there were several other females sitting around the dining table. Qing Zi was organizing a wedding in Hundred Miles City and now that the Qing Clan had come to the Continent's Capital, the three generations of the Qing Clan were not in a hurry to settle down and start a family. Furthermore, they were all Xiantian cultivators now, thus the elders did not bother them too much and let them be.</p>
 <p>Qing You’s dream had always been to find a pretty wife that could defeat him, causing people to wonder if he was a masochist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of himself, the girls that he interacted with in the past were all stronger than him back then…...</p>
 <p>There was always lots of chatter at the dinner table, the atmosphere was the very lively. Qing You and a few others were the most lively ones, the things that they said were quite amusing. Shi Qingzhuang and the other girls were always watching them and laughing, even Luan Luan and little Changfeng would say something every now and then.</p>
 <p>After dinner, Qing Shui took out the Five Elements Fruit. This time, Mingyue Gelou, Huoyun Liu-Li, Qing Bei, Qing You, Shi Qingzhuang, Wenren Wu-shuang, Qing He…… basically, everyone got a share. He splitted the ten fruits and distributed according to their elemental attributes. Looking at the numbers, everyone managed to obtain at least one, some even had two. Some people, like Qing Yi, had already consumed till the limit, furthermore, there were not many people with the wood attribute, thus everyone got three fruits. The fire attributed ones were not distributed, the metal attributed ones remained. There was actually no one in the Qing Clan with the metal attribute.</p>
 <p>After dinner, Qing Shui had one more task and that was to accompany Canghai Mingyue for a walk. The other girls swore by this, saying that babies being born this way would be smarter.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, the other girls would join Qing Shui for a walk, with a few small kids around, it was very lively. It was unknown whether it was the influence of the breakthrough of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant or the increase in Qing Shui’s strength, but Qing Shui’s state of mind was much calmer.</p>
 <p>“Are you tired, Mingyue?” Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue walked for a long distance, they were now on a wide street. Although it was night, the moon and the Light Stones made the area very bright.</p>
 <p>“I’m not tired!” Canghai Mingyue allowed Qing Shui to hold her hands as she faced Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>“It is getting late, it is getting colder too, let’s go back, you should rest early!”</p>
 <p>“Sure!”</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had picked her up by the waist and carried her, which caused her to cry out!</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, put me down, there are many people watching!” there were some people on the streets, but they were not watching like Canghai Mingyue had said.</p>
 <p>“I’m carrying you back, you don’t like being carried by me?” Qing Shui whispered softly into Canghai Mingyue’s ear.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue could feel a hot breath on her tender ears, in an instant, her charming face went red.</p>
 <p>The entranced Qing Shui could not resist and sucked on her ear lobes. This caused Canghai Mingyue to bury her head deep into Qing Shui’s chest, she no longer dared to raise her head.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui accompanied Canghai Mingyue in her room till she fell asleep. Qing Shui only returned to his own room when it was early in the morning. He then entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>He still needed to cultivate, cultivation was an accumulation of days and months of effort, it was not possible to instantly turn into an expert. Even amongst those of the same cultivation level, without sufficient mastery or experience with martial techniques, it could cause a situation where they could be killed easily by another cultivator of the same cultivation level.</p>
