 <p><strong>AST 1383 - He Is Yan Di [1]? He Is In Soaring Dragon Continent, The Demon Lord Palace Is One of the Four Evil Influences</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't deny this but didn't say much either. He merely nodded.</p>
 <p>"I don't know much, only that many people call him the Yan Di. He's a powerful existence in the Soaring Dragon Continent. I don't know the details," Linghu Yu looked at Qing Shui and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>Yan Di... Qing Shui was stunned. Was this his name or how others addressed him? Soaring Dragon Continent... How did the Soaring Dragon Continent compared to the Dancing Phoenix Continent?</p>
 <p>They say the dragon soars and the phoenix dances... The two of them should be about the same!</p>
 <p>"Thank you for telling me this," Qing Shui gave his sincere thanks.</p>
 <p>"You're welcome. But the relationship between the Soaring Dragon Continent and the Dancing Phoenix Continent isn't good. Therefore..."</p>
 <p>"I know. Don't worry. I know what I should do."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heaved a sigh of relief as well. He finally had news of him. This was also considered a breakthrough. He had initially thought that that man was in that vast and endless Haohan Continent. It was better for him to be in the Soaring Dragon Continent. It would be easier for him.</p>
 <p>"Sir, I have another question to ask." Since Qing Shui found someone who knew of a lot of things, he couldn't help but want to ask more.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to stand on ceremony. Go ahead, as long as it's things that I know of, I'll tell you," Linghu Yu said, being very friendly.</p>
 <p>"I'd like to know about the situation regarding the Demon Lord Palace." Qing Shui hesitated a little before asking.</p>
 <p>"The Demon Lord Palace?" Linghu Yu once again looked toward Qing Shui strangely. He knew that Qing Shui would definitely not ask about things for no reason at all. Since he asked this, they must have some relationship. However, how was he related to the Demon Lord Palace? It was clear that they weren't enemies. Could they be friends? Family?</p>
 <p>At that moment, Linghu Yu couldn't make up his mind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to have seen Linghu Yu's hesitation and said, smiling, "Sir, you just need to tell me the truth."</p>
 <p>Linghu Yu nodded, "The Demon Lord Palace is one of the four evil powers and are at bitter ends with those righteous powers. The Demon Lord Palace is situated in the intersection between the three continents and their territory expands out to many areas in each continent."</p>
 <p>Linghu Yu didn't say much but gave the most generic reply as he looked at Qing Shui's expression.</p>
 <p>"Is the Phoenix Dance Organization enemies with the Demon Lord Palace?" After Qing Shui asked this, he realized that his question was a little stupid.</p>
 <p>"We must be. It's because the creed of the Phoenix Dance Organization is to be righteous..." Linghu Yu said softly.</p>
 <p>"I'd like to know if the Demon Lord Palace is really one of those evil influences that would commit all kinds of evil?" Right now, Qing Shui didn't even know what answer he wanted when he asked this.</p>
 <p>"There's no clear distinction between justice and evil. Those on the path of evil can't possibly kill everyone they see either. The bad guys would also need a reason for killing. Righteousness and evil are just relative. It could be that to the people from the Demon Lord Palace, the righteous influence are just hypocrites and are even worse compared to those evil powers. Therefore, there's actually no clear distinction of the good and the bad. There's only enemies and vengeance." Linghu Yu smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as well. "You're truly wise. Are there no powers in the three continents that can wipe them out?"</p>
 <p>"There must both good and evil in this world. This is a balance. No matter how peaceful the times are, there will still be bandits. No matter how rich a city is, there'll be people who are poor. There are both good and evil powerss at each level and they each have their own means of survival. Therefore, their existence alone keeps up with the laws of the world."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded. He agreed a lot with what this old man said.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>In the Yelang Clan's hall, an old man, who was like a lion, appeared with an extremely grim expression. Yelang Qianyuan was grovelling before him, terror-stricken. The clan had lost over ten False Gods and to the Yelang Clan, it was as if they had lost an arm. How could the old man not be infuriated? Yelang Qianyuan was a sinner.</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun stood at the back, remaining very silent. He wore a very sad expression. He had reminded them repeatedly previously, trying to stop them. However, the many years of superiority and arrogance they had felt had blinded their eyes. This time around, Yelang Clan would be up against their greatest tribulation.</p>
 <p>Even if they were to utilize the power of their entire clan to wipe out Qing Shui, what good would that do? Yelang Clan would be dealt a severe blow and they would probably end up being wiped out by other powers and disappear into history. They might even end up being wiped out by that young man himself.</p>
 <p>The old man at the top understood this well and was now extremely infuriated. He decided to take action himself.</p>
 <p>"If I don't get rid of this kid, I won't be able to remain calm. This will result in me being unable to attain a breakthrough either." The old man was extremely infuriated.</p>
 <p>When Yelang Qiankun heard what the old man said, he sighed once again. Although it wasn't loud, many people in the hall heard it, including that old man.</p>
 <p>"Qiankun, what are you sighing for?" The old man was now a little regretful. Right now, he felt that this junior was more reliable compared to Yelang Qianyuan. This is the time for them to protect the clan's development, therefore, he felt that Yelang Qiankun was more suited for the job. However, he seemed to have been too hotheaded previously.</p>
 <p>"Old Master, with you around, Yelang Clan will be able to develop peacefully and rapidly. There won't be any problems for the Yelang Clan to reach new heights. If anything were to happen to you, then it's really the end for the Yelang Clan." Yelang Qiankun no long held any reservations and went straight to the point.</p>
 <p>What he said was a little bold and many people in the hall were perturbed. At the same time, they also admired Yelang Qiankun's bravery. Another reason was also because Yelang Qiankun was really thinking for the sake of the Yelang Clan.</p>
 <p>The old man didn't blow off his top and remained silent. He had lived very long and had learned to accept many things in life. To be looking down from a high position was an attitude. Right now, the Yelang Clan had reached a position where it was hard for them to turn back.</p>
 <p>"Qiankun, then what do you propose that we do? To accept this setback just like this?" The old man had now calmed down.</p>
 <p>"Old Master, that young couple's future achievements aren't something that the Yelang Clan can catch up with. I'm not trying to intentionally bring down our Yelang Clan. It won't have to take them long, not even three to five years. Old Master, even if we can't be friends we him, we mustn't make an enemy out of him," Yelang Qiankun said solemnly.</p>
 <p>"Yelang Clan has been too superficial. I'm old now. Qiankun, Yelang Clan will be left for you to take charge of. You'll call the shots for any matter concerning the clan. Unless the clan is facing a life and death situation, then don't come and disturb me." With that, the old man disappeared.</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun didn't feel too happy. In a big clan, things like this were very common. He was already very disappointed with the Yelang Clan. The safety they had been enjoying for so many years had caused them to lose their sanity.</p>
 <p>If it wasn't for this, Yelang Clan wouldn't have had to sacrifice over ten False Gods for nothing. It was still not too late. The later they stopped, the harder it would be for them to salvage the situation. Thankfully, Yelang Qianyuan had kept a low profile in this operation. Although there were people who knew that it was the Yelang Clan, there weren't many of them.</p>
 <p>However, he was worried that Qing Shui would bear enmity toward them and take the initiative to find trouble for Yelang Clan. Rubbing his head, Yelang Qiankun headed outside.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next day, what took Qing Shui by surprise was that Yelang Qiankun had come to become a customer of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. This was the only person from the Yelang Clan which Qing Shui was still willing to talk to. He didn't even wish to look at the other members from the Yelang Clan. If it wasn't because of Tianhe Renmo, Qing Shui would probably have killed Yelang Wuji the previous time. However, he wanted to leave Yelang Wuji for Tianhe Renmo.</p>
 <p>The Yelang Clan was meant to decline. Qing Shui wasn't one who would allow himself to be bullied. The fact that he wasn't planning on taking action now didn't mean that he wouldn't do so in the future. He wouldn't mind paying them back in kind for what they had done to him.</p>
 <p>Yelang Qiankun was a clever man and didn't try to talk Qing Shui out of anything. It was because right now, Qing Shui had yet to say that he was going to do anything. He could only take practical actions and use time to neutralize Qing Shui's thoughts toward the Yelang Clan.</p>
 <p>He had previously promised Qing Shui that he would give the Imperial Cuisine Hall a good environment and had now started to work on this. Yelang Clan's regulations were also stricter now. This was especially true if the younger members acted arrogantly, they would be seized and dealt with harshly.</p>
 <p>However, all this was of no concern to Qing Shui. He had no mood to care about what they did. Many people now felt that the Imperial Cuisine Hall wasn't simple due to the visit from the Linghu Clan as well as what the Yelang Clan had done for them.</p>
 <p>In a few days time, the reputation of the Imperial Cuisine Hall was now stronger. It was because Linghu Tui, had, like his name, gone through a transformation [2]. His body, which was previously fat, had now completely recovered to be how Linghu Clan's number one genius had looked in the past. He had regained his abilities as well. Everyone knew that these were all thanks to the Imperial Cuisine Hall's Miraculous Physician.</p>
 <p>Another thing was that the fragrance that came out from Imperial Cuisine Hall was so nice that some people had the urge to barge in and snatch the things for themselves. It was a pity that the place wasn't one that just anyone could enter. Only the people with the "Guest Card" given out by the Imperial Cuisine Hall could enter and the one entering could only be the person themselves.</p>
 <p>The fragrance was naturally from things like the Jade Steamed Bun.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui came out, he was surprised to find a little kid with tattered clothes. The child was seated at a corner near the door and had fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. This child only appeared to be about three years old and was wearing torn and tattered clothes. The child was very thin and weak. Qing Shui walked over slowly. The child had very long hair and seemed to have a pale countenance. However the child had exquisite features. It was a girl.</p>
 <p>As if sensing that someone was around, the lass opened her pair of big eyes. They were very clear but appeared to be very lost. There was some dirt on her little pale face.</p>
 <p>"Lass, where's your mother?" Qing Shui squatted down and asked softly.</p>
 <p>The lass shook her head softly and her eyes appeared even more lost. However, she didn't cry. Her gaze would tug at one's heart.</p>
 <p>Rumble~!</p>
 <p>The lass' stomach growled loudly and she reflexively touched her stomach, twitched her nose and then looked toward the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>The lass blinked her pair of big eyes as she looked at Qing Shui. Qing Shui also heard the sound of her stomach growling and quickly took out two piping hot Jade Steamed Buns, handing them to her.</p>
 <p>She was still a kid after all and she wasn't even at the age at which she could remember stuff.</p>
 <p>The girl took the buns and started eating them in big bites. However, her actions didn't appear abrupt but only made one felt pity for her.</p>
 <p>Just then, Yehuang Guwu walked out and squatted down next to Qing Shui. She looked at the little girl and her eyes grew increasingly brighter, "Qing Shui, look at how young she is. She must have been separated from her mother. Why don't we take her in? I'll have a child that way."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and said, "Alright!"</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu didn't mind that the little girl was dirty and just carried her. What was strange was that the little girl didn't seem to mind Yehuang Guwu either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt helpless too. With Yehuang Guwu's physique, it wasn't easy for her to get a child. He stood there for a very long time before he went back, headed up to the highest story and walked into Yehuang Guwu's room. Yehuang Guwu and the lass had already cleaned up and was wearing a new set of clothes, the lass appeared to be like a beautiful crystal doll. Yehuang Guwu and Yuan Su were playing with her.</p>
 <p>The lass only smiled but didn't say a word. Qing Shui felt that something was wrong and took her pulse. She was born without a vocal meridian.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, how is it?"</p>
 <p>"She fine. It's just that she can't talk. She will never be able to talk."</p>
