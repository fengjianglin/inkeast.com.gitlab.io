 <p><strong>AST 1073 - Finished, Killing, Low Grade Sacred Beast Pill</strong></p>
 <p><span>Buddha's True Eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui used his Buddha's True Eyes on the tall and burly old man. At the same time, he activated his Nine Palace Steps' </span><span>Reversal of Qiankun</span><span>, switching their positions. He then used the Nine Palace Steps once again. This time around, his target was Old Fifth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although the tall and burly old man's reaction was fast enough, when something like this occurred, there was bound to be a moment of reaction lapse. In a fight between experts, just a short moment could cause one to lose their life.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the way, Qing Shui grabbed a 10,000 Years Frosted Iron Ball while the Thunderous Beast spewed out the </span><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span>.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the opportunity that Qing Shui had been waiting for. He swung his Big Dipper Sword and confined Old Fifth with the Sixth Waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palm. The </span><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span> also encompassed Old Fifth like a big net.</span></p>
 <p><span>One of Old Fifth's shoulders were crippled. In addition, he was struck by Thunderbolt for such a long period of time. Once this attack held him back, there was only one thing left for him—death.</span></p>
 <p><span>Old Fifth could be said to have his entire body in a state of numbness and he was also injured. He was consumed in a state of terror and then everything quietened down. Qing Shui's mind seemed to have calmed down now.</span></p>
 <p><span>Once held back by the Thunderous Beast, if one didn't have any special treasure to escape, they would end up in a terrible state. Old Fifth's death caused one of the remaining three demonic beasts to run. It had already been on tenterhooks because of Qing Shui's Soulshake Bell and had only stayed because Old Fifth was its master. However, after seeing Old Fifth's death, it just made its escape.</span></p>
 <p><span>The whole battlefield seemed to have suddenly become irreversible, leaving only the tall and burly old man. When Qing Shui saw the old man's gaze, he knew that the latter no longer had any will to fight. However, Qing Shui didn't plan on letting him escape.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nine Palace Steps, </span><span>So Close Yet Worlds Apart</span><span>!</span></p>
 <p><span>Divinity Protection!</span></p>
 <p><span>Before using Divinity Protection, Qing Shui let out the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm in his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool. Qing Shui's action caused the old man to be frightened and he had no choice but to quickly take action. He now didn't have any more hesitations but only endless fury.</span></p>
 <p><span>Die! </span><span>Sacrificial Sabre Lion King Slash</span><span>!</span></p>
 <p><span>The huge pitch black battle sabre seemed as if it was alive, and a faint image of a ferocious black lion appeared atop it. It exuded a cold and corrosive power as it slashed toward Qing Shui with eerie-looking black flames.</span></p>
 <p><span>This attack caused the surroundings to be encompassed by darkness. The powerful confinement power it had even caused Qing Shui to feel a great impact.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nature Energy, State of Immovable as Mountains!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui circulated these two skills to their limits and retreated. He wasn't very worried since he still had the Divinity Protection and the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm had already entered his opponent’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span>The ‘</span><span>Black Lion King Sabre</span><span>’ slashed down towards Qing Shui but was reflected by a faint golden glow. However, Qing Shui was still sent flying backward while the old man grabbed his head and howled in agony.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm was extremely vicious, killing without any notice. As long as it attacked from a very close distance, the chances of it failing wouldn't be high. This was unless the opponent's body was really indestructible or that his spirit energy was so high that he could kill the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm in his body.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui had successfully fended off the attack by the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm once, and that was also when he had managed to subdue it. The reason he had succeeded was because of his Yin-Yang Image as well as the activation of the Central Palace Blood Essence Pool. Most importantly, the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm's strength right now was not comparable to what it was back then.</span></p>
 <p><span>The agonized cry stopped very quickly and the tall and burly old man, Old Fourth, fell to the ground. Qing Shui walked up to him to recall the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm. Old Fourth's head was crushed and now, Qing Shui felt very relaxed. He also increasingly felt that this trump card was very useful.</span></p>
 <p><span>He turned to look at the Thunderous Beast which was still covered in a brilliant violet aura. It still had its Lion King's Ridge activated and its recovery abilities were ten times as fast as usual. Qing Shui kept the Thunderous Beast. The two consecutive Violet Lightning Strikes could kill an old man from the Lion King's Ridge like this instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Life was very fragile. These three old men would be a fearful existence no matter where they went but they were all laid to rest here. Power. Only power decided everything. In this world where power was revered, if one didn't have any power, they would be nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui retrieved their Interspatial Silk Sachets and weapons, then waved his hand to ‘incremate’ their corpses with primordial flames. When one was going around in this world, they must be prepared for things like this.</span></p>
 <p><span>After everything was taken care of, Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps to leave. He knew that Lion King's Ridge would know of the three old men's death very soon but none of their belongings were left behind. In the end, they would only be able to find out that the three old men had died but it should be hard to find out how they died. Moreover, since they were in the Ancient Ruins, it was even harder to determine how they had died.</span></p>
 <p><span>Not long after Qing Shui left, over ten people appeared at the place. There were people from Lion King's Ridge as well as some other people. The person in the lead was an old man dressed in silver clothes, equally tall and burly. His beard and hair were all silvery white and were a foot long. However, he exuded a mysterious aura.</span></p>
 <p><span>"There are traces of a battle lingering here. It's likely that Old Fourth, Old Fifth, and Old Sixth are no longer alive."</span></p>
 <p><span>The silver clothed old man stood in the middle of the place where the fight had occurred. He closed his eyes and slowly spoke with a low voice. It was hard to tell that there were any emotional fluctuations from him.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Third Brother, how is this possible? They were together... Could it be that they had encountered some ancient beasts? But there's none here." An old man looked at the silver clothed old man and said in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span>"13th, they were killed by some other cultivators." When the old man spoke, his eyes opened electrifyingly and stared into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What kind of person would be able to kill 4th, 5th, 6th Brothers and over ten powerful demonic beasts in such a short amount of time? Could it be that they had many people..."</span></p>
 <p><span>"There weren't many of them, probably not more than three. 13th, go inform Eldest Brother and let him tell the others to be careful. Someone is after members of our Lion King's Ridge." The silver-clothed old man sighed and said.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seven members from Lion King's Ridge stayed behind while the rest left. Those people didn't come along with Lion King's Ridge, but just crossed paths coincidentally. The guy called 13th left as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let's go and search around to see if we can find out anything." The silver-clothed old man leaped into the air while the others followed.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, they didn't know that Qing Shui was already 400,000 li away.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yin winds!</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment Qing Shui came here, he could sense the powerful yin winds in the area. It was still a little dark here, as if it was the end of the world. The yin winds in the area seemed to desire to sweep away humans' souls.</span></p>
 <p><span>The world's pressure was increasingly powerful. Thankfully, Qing Shui could ignore the impact. Otherwise, even his movements would be greatly affected. Because he had cultivated the Ancient Strengthening Technique and Nature Energy, even the yin winds in the surroundings didn't affect him much.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the Ancient Ruins, the ancient beasts were not the only terrifying aspect. Even natural disasters could stop these powerful cultivators in their tracks. If one didn't have a few pieces of treasures or some unique skills with them, they wouldn't be able to take a single step forward.</span></p>
 <p><span>After sensing that there were no dangers around him with his spiritual sense, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal directly.</span></p>
 <p><span>He would have to spend six hours in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and it was about time for him to do so. He performed the Nine Continents Steps once again and then returned. </span></p>
 <p><span>Earlier, after using the Nine Continents Steps, he had realized that the area was a mountain range. He had even seen a huge demonic beast with a scale armor that was the size of a small mountain. Qing Shui headed back without any hesitation and planned to check the place out the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span>He returned to the place with strong yin winds and then entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to cultivate and rest. He also wanted to take a look at the three Interspatial Silk Sachets while he was at it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Actually, what Qing Shui was interested in was the low grade </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span> Old Sixth had mentioned. It could allow one to tame powerful demonic beasts without taking into concern one's cultivation level. It could even allow one to tame a powerful existence like the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast. Qing Shui was full of anticipation for this.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was in no hurry to open Old Sixth's Interspatial Silk Sachet but started with Old Fourth's whose Interspatial Silk Sachets was of the highest grade and was the most powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the owner of Interspatial Silk Sachets die, they would become ownerless and one would only be required to wipe off the spirit energy mark left behind. If a person couldn't do it themselves, they could get someone to help them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui naturally didn't need any help for that. Putting aside the fact that his spirit energy exceeded that of his opponents, even if it didn't, he would have a way to erase the mark. The effects of Nature Energy, Shield attack and Yin-Yang Image were all very mysterious.</span></p>
 <p><span>After successfully wiping off the spirit energy marks left behind by the old man, he looked into the sachet and broke into a smile. This Interspatial Silk Sachet was really good. It was both ten meters in length, width, and height and could be considered as quite a powerful Interspatial Silk Sachet. One which had a volume of 1000 cubic meters was considered to be very big.</span></p>
 <p><span>In such a big space, there was a bed, a desk, a tent, wardrobe, as well as a pile of gold coins, food, things to use, water...</span></p>
 <p><span>There were also many medicinal herbs as well as some strange items. There were many books and bottles on the desk.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was very happy. All of these items were quite good and even if he had no use for them, Heavenly Palace and his family palace would be able to use them. There were also some strange items which could have other uses.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui's first target was the bottles on the desk. He took them all out.</span></p>
 <p><span>Vitality Moisturizer, Blood Staunching Powder, Living Blood Pellet</span><span>, Poison Avoidance Pill...</span></p>
 <p><span>Fish King Pill, Heartbreak Powder, low grade </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span>…</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmm, low grade </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span>?" Qing Shui was stunned. He was sure that this Interspatial Silk Sachet did not belong to that ‘Old Sixth’.</span></p>
 <p><span>To think that there were three bottles of low grade </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span>s. Qing Shui opened them up to find that there were only two in each bottle, one big and one small. He then looked at a piece of paper at the bottom with a description written on it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui understood after reading it. This was a medicinal pill that was similar to a Divine Marionette but was much weaker in comparison. However, these low grade </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span>s were still very powerful and even the Elders of Lion King's Ridge might not necessarily have them. Earlier, when Qing Shui had heard Old Sixth mentioned that he was going to subdue the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast with the low grade </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span>, he already knew how rare these things were.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, he hadn't expected that this Old Fourth who had remained silent actually had three bottles of these. It seemed like he couldn’t bear to use them and wanted to use them when there were suitable demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only Lion King's Ridge had low grade </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span>. As for whether they could still refine them, outsiders have no idea. Lion King's Ridge would only reward loyal and powerful people in the sect or from the main branch. In principle, it allowed one to subdue extremely powerful demonic beasts but the prerequisite was that the person must get the demonic beast they wished to tame to eat that bigger </span><span>Sacred Beast Pill</span><span>.</span></p>
