 <p><strong>Chapter 356 I Am No Longer A Good Match For You, Riding the Wind and Cresting the Waves, Happy New Year.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 356 - I Am No Longer A Good Match For You, Riding the Wind and Cresting the Waves, Happy New Year</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at this slightly stubborn beautiful lady who would always feel as if she was indebted to him. He felt pained for her, wishing only to care for her, take good care of her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Mingyue Gelou did not say a word, her brows were furrowed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, you're also aware of my relationship with Shi Qingzhuang. If I were to marry the two of you together, would you agree? Would you not like me and end up hating me?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's different. Marrying her is something you ought to do. I'm already very satisfied now. As long as I can stay by your side, help you out with some stuff, I'll be very content. I'm not a good match for you anymore. Other people would just badmouth us," Mingyue Gelou said. She was a bit anxious but still tried to calm herself down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. This great beauty was still holding back, and did not have much confidence when she was before him; she was someone he loved a lot but yet made him upset at the same time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, if you were to become a Martial Saint level cultivator one day, or even stronger, would you look down on me and leave us?" Qing Shui, feeling helpless, could only try to give her another push.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"No, never. No matter what I become, I'll never take the initiative to leave you, unless you no longer wish to see me," Mingyue Gelou said anxiously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, remember, you'll always be my woman, my wife. I'll care for you with my life. You're no lower than any other person and will always be the most beautiful and purest woman in my heart." When they walked to the herbal garden, Qing Shui looked into Mingyue Gelou's beautiful eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mmm mmm...."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing that she wanted to say more, Qing Shui planted a kiss right on that small mouth of hers, hugging her tightly. While she felt a bit stiff at first, her anxiousness melted and she felt soft to the touch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, as if punishing her, kissed Mingyue Gelou furiously, his tongue reaching out into her wet and sweet-tasting mouth, entangling with her tender tongue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Gradually, Mingyue Gelou's breathing turned heavy, her face flushed, and her saintly and poised face became so beautiful that it would make one go crazy. Not knowing since when, her arms were already wrapped tightly around Qing Shui's neck.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sucked on the moisture in her mouth forcefully, creating smacking sounds. One of his hands was around her slender waist, while the other one sneaked under her clothes, reaching for her two peaks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui grabbed a handful of softness, Mingyue Gelou let out a tremble and turned limp as she leaned against him, allowing his hand to wantonly squeeze and rub about.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soft and tender, with great elasticity, extremely well-embodied, fantastic to the touch, and hard for one to be willing to let go!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually moved his mouth away, and a thread of saliva connected their lips, giving out an indescribable lewdness. Mingyue Gelou saw this and buried her face into Qing Shui's arms, causing him to break out in laughter.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui was feeling flustered. To be able to cause a trickle of saliva to connect from &nbsp;him to a saint and poised looking beauty, that saintly appearance looking so shy within such &nbsp;close proximity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, remember to keep the door for me tonight. I've missed you!" Qing Shui lightly bit on her beautiful earlobes as he whispered into Mingyue Gelou's ears.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Ahhh!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Letting out a surprised cry, Mingyue Gelou's saintly beautiful eyes were wide open. It was just that this gaze, with that slightly seductive expression, gave her an irresistible seductive charm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a seduction which only belonged to Mingyue Gelou alone!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at her expression, a ball of fire burned again in Qing Shui's heart, causing him to be unable to resist the urge to devour her now. He hugged her tightly, two hands climbing up her sharp peaks, and even pulled up her clothes which were not very thick.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Two balls of snow white peaks jumped out. While they were not extremely big, they were round and perky. Her trembling looks caused Qing Shui to just put his mouth onto one of them, sucking on it furiously. His two hands moved, touching her perky butt after going into her clothes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, not here..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly got his senses together, astonished at Mingyue Gelou's charms. It was not that no one would come by this place. Qing Shui lifted his head unwillingly, and Mingyue Gelou had already arranged her clothes properly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, one of Qing Shui's hands was wrapped around Mingyue Gelou's slender waist, while the other one was in between her legs!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continuously probed that most hidden area, while using the other hand to lift Mingyue Gelou's chin, looking at her beautiful face which was definitely a threat which could bring troubles to a country and its people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui and Mingyue Gelou returned to the hall, almost everyone was there. Everyone looked at Mingyue Gelou who had a flushed red face. Only those who had been through it knew what had happened when they saw her flushed red face and slightly swollen lips.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Zi grinned impishly as he looked at Qing Shui. Feng Yanfei, who was beside him, was carrying a two-year-old boy, as she smiled teasingly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Eldest nephew, come let me carry!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled, reaching out his hands to carry that little fellow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It might be because of the aura he naturally exuded. The little fellow was one who usually was quite scared of strangers, but when Qing Shui carried him, not only did he not cry, he even reached out his hands to touch Qing Shui's face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What is the child called?" Qing Shui asked casually.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"No name. The first male descendent in Qing Clan's fourth generation, but his name has not been decided after all this while. Everyone was waiting for you to come back and decide a name for him," Feng Yanfei replied seriously as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. He had not expected that his words now carried weight in the clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, he did not know that he was already Qing Clan's pillar and its soul.No matter what problem, what decision, no one would go against him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Then let's call him Qing Changfeng. Hope that he'll be able to ride the wind and crest the waves when he grows up!" Qing Shui look at the little fellow and laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was an extremely lively meal, and was also the happiest meal for Qing Clan after a very long time. The topic of everyone's talk went around Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Where's Little fatty?" Qing Shui suddenly recalled the little fatty, or rather, the big fatty, though he was young in age.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Oh, if Brother Shui had not mentioned it, I'd have forgotten about it. He went to become a monk!" Qing Bei open her eyes wide and answered seriously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Monk?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's right. Two years ago, a big monk passed by here. He was really comparable to Little fatty in size, but he looked very amiable and his level of cultivation was very, very high. We couldn't even move an inch under the aura he exuded." Qing Bei was especially happy when she mentioned that big monk.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"He said that the had an affinity with Little fatty, and hoped that he would become his disciple, and Little fatty also agreed happily. He told us to tell you that you're the closest person to him," Qing Bei now said, a little down crested.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Did he say where he had come from?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I think he mentioned that it was Central Continent's Buddha Sect..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"From Central Continent..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's right, Old Master had sent words!" 3rd Uncle Qinghu walked into the hall, smiling as he said this. Initially, those in the hall were all the 3rd generation of Qing Clan, but with 3rd uncle's entry, Qing Yi, Yuan Ying, Qing Hai, Song Yan, Qing He, Qing Jiang, and even Qing Clan's remaining members also stepped in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mother, Eldest Uncle, Second Uncle..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not expect everyone to come here so early in the morning. Other than the Old Master and the elderly who oversees Qing Clan's library, everyone else had brought their families to Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What did the Old Master say?" Qing Shui seemed to have realized something, and suddenly, did not know what to feel.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"The Old Master said that he's handing Qing Clan to you. Everything in Qing Clan will be decided by you alone. While you may no longer care about this small unpresentable clan, the Old Master still wishes that you can lead Qing Clan to walk out into the world of the nine continents." 3rd Uncle looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While Qing Shui had already planned to lead Qing Clan to prosperity, he had not thought that the Old Master would be so decisive. Seemed like he had long made this decision.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was gratifying to be trusted. Qing Shui looked at the two generations of Qing Clan's members, gave it some thought for a while before he said gradually, "Since the Old Master trusts me, I'll give it a shot."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"3rd Uncle, 4th Uncle and mother have all taken the Crippling Divine Pill, and it would be hard for them to be able to have much progress even if you were to cultivate. Even I don't have a solution to that. But I promise to give you guys a surprise within five years. For now, I'll still leave Qing Clan's trade matters to you. Everything in Qing Clan will be left to the two uncles, uncle's wife, and mother."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a short hesitation, everyone nodded!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'll only take care of matters with regards to raising your level of cultivation. As for Eldest and 2nd Uncle, I'll think of a way to, at the end of the year, or latest by the end of the next new year, bring you guys to Xiantian. It might be a little tough on you!" After thinking, Qing Shui looked towards Qing Jiang and Qing He, who were both at the pinnacle of Houtian now, and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A bright gleam flashed in Qing Jiang's and Qing He's eyes. If it was in the past, they would never have thought that this would be real. But now, Qing Shui had reached unattainable heights at the lunar age of twenty years old.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Then what about us?" Qing You looked at Qing Shui, brimming with envy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That yearning for power did not make Qing Shui feel uncomfortable, but rather, he liked how straightforward he was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"As for you guys, it'll depend on when you'll be able to attain the pinnacle of Houtian!" Qing Shui knew that he should give them a short term goal, but it should not be one that was too easily achievable. The pinnacle of Houtian should be a pretty good choice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Is it that if we're able to reach the pinnacle of Houtian, Brother Qing Shui will aid us to break through to Xiantian?" Qing You was honest and straightforward, but he was not stupid. That was why he sounded so happy</p>

 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, not here..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suddenly got his senses together, astonished at Mingyue Gelou's charms. It was not that no one would come by this place. Qing Shui lifted his head unwillingly, and Mingyue Gelou had already arranged her clothes properly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, one of Qing Shui's hands was wrapped around Mingyue Gelou's slender waist, while the other one was in between her legs!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continuously probed that most hidden area, while using the other hand to lift Mingyue Gelou's chin, looking at her beautiful face which was definitely a threat which could bring troubles to a country and its people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui and Mingyue Gelou returned to the hall, almost everyone was there. Everyone looked at Mingyue Gelou who had a flushed red face. Only those who had been through it knew what had happened when they saw her flushed red face and slightly swollen lips.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Zi grinned impishly as he looked at Qing Shui. Feng Yanfei, who was beside him, was carrying a two-year-old boy, as she smiled teasingly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Eldest nephew, come let me carry!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled, reaching out his hands to carry that little fellow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It might be because of the aura he naturally exuded. The little fellow was one who usually was quite scared of strangers, but when Qing Shui carried him, not only did he not cry, he even reached out his hands to touch Qing Shui's face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What is the child called?" Qing Shui asked casually.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"No name. The first male descendent in Qing Clan's fourth generation, but his name has not been decided after all this while. Everyone was waiting for you to come back and decide a name for him," Feng Yanfei replied seriously as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. He had not expected that his words now carried weight in the clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, he did not know that he was already Qing Clan's pillar and its soul.No matter what problem, what decision, no one would go against him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Then let's call him Qing Changfeng. Hope that he'll be able to ride the wind and crest the waves when he grows up!" Qing Shui look at the little fellow and laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was an extremely lively meal, and was also the happiest meal for Qing Clan after a very long time. The topic of everyone's talk went around Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Where's Little fatty?" Qing Shui suddenly recalled the little fatty, or rather, the big fatty, though he was young in age.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Oh, if Brother Shui had not mentioned it, I'd have forgotten about it. He went to become a monk!" Qing Bei open her eyes wide and answered seriously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Monk?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's right. Two years ago, a big monk passed by here. He was really comparable to Little fatty in size, but he looked very amiable and his level of cultivation was very, very high. We couldn't even move an inch under the aura he exuded." Qing Bei was especially happy when she mentioned that big monk.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"He said that the had an affinity with Little fatty, and hoped that he would become his disciple, and Little fatty also agreed happily. He told us to tell you that you're the closest person to him," Qing Bei now said, a little down crested.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Did he say where he had come from?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I think he mentioned that it was Central Continent's Buddha Sect..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"From Central Continent..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's right, Old Master had sent words!" 3rd Uncle Qinghu walked into the hall, smiling as he said this. Initially, those in the hall were all the 3rd generation of Qing Clan, but with 3rd uncle's entry, Qing Yi, Yuan Ying, Qing Hai, Song Yan, Qing He, Qing Jiang, and even Qing Clan's remaining members also stepped in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mother, Eldest Uncle, Second Uncle..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not expect everyone to come here so early in the morning. Other than the Old Master and the elderly who oversees Qing Clan's library, everyone else had brought their families to Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What did the Old Master say?" Qing Shui seemed to have realized something, and suddenly, did not know what to feel.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"The Old Master said that he's handing Qing Clan to you. Everything in Qing Clan will be decided by you alone. While you may no longer care about this small unpresentable clan, the Old Master still wishes that you can lead Qing Clan to walk out into the world of the nine continents." 3rd Uncle looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While Qing Shui had already planned to lead Qing Clan to prosperity, he had not thought that the Old Master would be so decisive. Seemed like he had long made this decision.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was gratifying to be trusted. Qing Shui looked at the two generations of Qing Clan's members, gave it some thought for a while before he said gradually, "Since the Old Master trusts me, I'll give it a shot."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"3rd Uncle, 4th Uncle and mother have all taken the Crippling Divine Pill, and it would be hard for them to be able to have much progress even if you were to cultivate. Even I don't have a solution to that. But I promise to give you guys a surprise within five years. For now, I'll still leave Qing Clan's trade matters to you. Everything in Qing Clan will be left to the two uncles, uncle's wife, and mother."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a short hesitation, everyone nodded!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'll only take care of matters with regards to raising your level of cultivation. As for Eldest and 2nd Uncle, I'll think of a way to, at the end of the year, or latest by the end of the next new year, bring you guys to Xiantian. It might be a little tough on you!" After thinking, Qing Shui looked towards Qing Jiang and Qing He, who were both at the pinnacle of Houtian now, and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A bright gleam flashed in Qing Jiang's and Qing He's eyes. If it was in the past, they would never have thought that this would be real. But now, Qing Shui had reached unattainable heights at the lunar age of twenty years old.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Then what about us?" Qing You looked at Qing Shui, brimming with envy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That yearning for power did not make Qing Shui feel uncomfortable, but rather, he liked how straightforward he was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"As for you guys, it'll depend on when you'll be able to attain the pinnacle of Houtian!" Qing Shui knew that he should give them a short term goal, but it should not be one that was too easily achievable. The pinnacle of Houtian should be a pretty good choice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Is it that if we're able to reach the pinnacle of Houtian, Brother Qing Shui will aid us to break through to Xiantian?" Qing You was honest and straightforward, but he was not stupid. That was why he sounded so happy</p>
