 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman seemed to have noticed his surprise from his looks. However, she didn’t say a thing as if she was used to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then introduced his own name. Since both of the ladies had introduced themselves, it was his turn to do the same. It was an act of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dishes were plentiful. Only three of them were at the table. They got familiar with each other soon sitting together as they were folks in martial cultivation with outstanding strengths. Plus, Qing Shui and Sheng Jun were both humans whose inheritance was closely related.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wouldn’t doubt the character of Sacred Fairy Inheritor and vice versa. The Battle God Inheritor was a symbol of justice. One could never get inheritance without a fair mind. Moreover, Sheng Jin could sense the tremendous power of justice from Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Sister Jun, how did you own a force in the bottom of the ocean as a human?” Muyun Qingge asked out of curiosity. Women were strange. There were times when two pretty ladies to be friends but there were also times when they became enemies instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It's a long story. In the beginning, I actually didn't expect this to happen. I got the inheritance from the Sacred Fairy, so I have to carry out her tasks. One of them was to protect the Sacred Mountain from being destroyed by the forces in Ocean Domain.” Sheng Jun kept it short and precise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humans, the ordinary ones, could never survive here. Nevertheless, they were mostly humans here. Qing Shui discovered the fact that even the normal people could survive within the compound of the Sacred Mountain. This was the blessing of the Sacred Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the blessing of Sacred Mountain, humans could reproduce and continue their generations here. It was also the effect of the Sacred Mountain to lower the strengths of some aquatic demonic beasts here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many laymen here in the bottom of the ocean. It was tough for some who wanted to return to land. The route to the ocean surface was impermeable by the ordinary men unless they had strong warriors' help. They had lived here for years and generations. They wouldn't leave even if they could. They would have nowhere to go after leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Apparently there are no other forces in this area. Is any of them planning to go against the Sacred Mountain?” Qing Shui questioned curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep in his heart, he wondered if the other forces would ransack the place when they discovered the existence of such a pretty woman here. It was a fact that there were a lot of women in Sacred Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power of Sacred Mountain was formidable. Qing Shui knew through his spiritual sense that they were stronger if using pure strength as a metric. Yet, the victory often fell on the unknown in an actual battle. Qing Shui reckoned this woman could only be at most double his own strength at her limit, which was absolutely fine for his resistance power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Besides the Sacred Mountain, there were the Evil Dragon Cavern and the Vampiric Demoness Hills.” Sheng Jun said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was such a peculiar world. Qing Shui was astonished to hear about the Vampiric Demoness. They were an ancient tribe who approached the humans boundlessly and were not distinctly different from humans. They were similar to the vampires in past life who depended on blood to survive. All of them were good-looking females. Yet, they were frightening and powerful, even without training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not worried about the Vampiric Demoness because the Sacred Mountain’s power of purity was the nemesis to all kinds of devilish and crooked paths. Besides, the same applied to Qing Shui’s righteous mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Vampiric Demoness shouldn’t be a threat to the Sacred Mountain.” Qing Shui claimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The normal Vampiric Demonesses are not threatening, but they have their chiefs and the Queen who are not afraid of the Sacred Mountain’s power. I’m fine with it but there are many ordinary people here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Sheng Jun talked about the Vampiric Demoness, she seemed to be worried, helpless, and furious. This prompted Qing Shui’s thought that the Sacred Mountain was frequently disturbed by the Vampiric Demoness. However, only a minority of them could be here due to the sacred power of Sacred Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there’s a chance, I would like to meet this mystical tribe.” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Sister Jun, Haven’t you had the chance to leave the Sacred Mountain all recently?” Muyun Qingge interrupted occasionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have left for a few times, actually. The Sacred Mountain is standing firm now. It would be great to suppress the Vampiric Demoness and Evil Dragon Cavern next. It would be a big relief and I can finally feel at ease to leave.” Sheng Jun seemed to yearn for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things got awkward again in the night. Since they were thought of as husband and wife, they were then arranged to stay in a small courtyard. After all, they had to stay within a tiny building although it was not in anyway uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two floors in the tiny house. Once returned to the courtyard, Muyun Qingge realized that her heart had been racing uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The living room looked warm and average in size, about 100 square meters. This was rather small in the Main Continent. However, it was the best in Qing Shui’s opinion. In his past life, his entire house was about the same size or even half of this. Not to mention, the house was equipped with a living room, a kitchen, bathrooms, and bedrooms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll stay here. you can stay on the second floor!” Qing Shui grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm.” Muyun Qingge spoke very softly while slightly lowering her head. Then, she looked up and mumbled, “I’ll go up then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go ahead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t head upstairs. Looking at the neat and dustless place, he knew it had been cleaned. Moreover, the items were all new. He walked straight to the couch and sat down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pondered deeply. This woman, Sheng Jun, surprisingly did not request for the Sacred Earth Demonic Fruit, even after knowing that he had obtained it. He was uncertain if she also knew that the Great Earth Sea Snake had been conquered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sacred Earth Demonic Fruit was powerful and precious. However, it was only applicable to the Earth demonic beasts, hence the strict selection criteria. The Earth demonic beasts were normally heavy and clumsy so people were reluctant to tame them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weaker Earth demonic beasts were pretty useless whereas the stronger ones were hard to tame. It was largely dependent on one’s strength. Only a fool would tame an Earth demonic beast which was weaker than himself. Comparatively, the Beast Tamer would tame the least Earth demonic beasts among the rest. A suitable Earth demonic beast would only be tamed by chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, Qing Shui owned the Sacred Earth Demonic Fruit now. After all, he had an advantage, an absolutely great advantage. Once he got the Sacred Mudra Flower, things would be perfect and beyond his expectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he had the news of the Sacred Mudra Flower, Qing Shui was determined to find it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qing Shui was absorbed in his thoughts, Muyun Qingge came down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was confused to see her and asked, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
