  <p><strong>AST 0133 – The Beautiful Mingyue Gelou!</strong></p>
  <p>“Do you want me to go with you to deal with the Golden-Ringed Snake King?” Qing Shui was not afraid of the poison of the snake king, thus it was not a terrifying prospect for him to fight the demonic beast. Qing Shui had absolute confidence in his abilities now.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, I thought of this before. Previously since I was able to escape alive, and after which, I ate two of the Clear-Wind Fruits. I can confidently say that keeping our lives intact shouldn’t be a problem. Moreover, your medical skills are so great, there shouldn’t be anything to worry about.”</p>
  <p>As Qing Shui regarded Wu-shuang, he realized that his own personality had undergone a change, becoming more friendly and natural as well. He loved the feeling of making more friends, and in the future, were he to venture to some unknown and strange locations, how heartwarming would it be if he ran into someone familiar.</p>
  <p>“Fine, I want to see how the snake king looks like. When the time comes I help you detoxify the poison… I can do that again…hehe, when do you want to move out?” Qing Shui felt that it would be extremely boring if he were to be cooped up here all day, thus he should do something exciting once in a while.</p>
  <p>“If it’s convenient for you, we will set out tomorrow. You should go prepare now.” Wenren Wu-shuang blushed as she gently replied.</p>
  <p>Now that there wasn’t anyone else, Qing Shui and Wu-shuang were leisurely chatting in the Martial Clinic. The atmosphere was very casual, akin to two buddies chatting about everything under the sun.</p>
  <p>“Young Master, this is the Martial Clinic!” Abruptly, a voice drifted over, interrupting the chat between Qing Shui and Wu-shuang!</p>
  <p>It was the youth which Qing Shui had chased away earlier. But now, there were actually over 10 other people following him. In the lead, standing beside that youth from earlier, was also another youth who had a majesty appearance. He appeared to be about 30 years of age, with candid looking eyes and adorned with sword-shaped eyebrows.</p>
  <p>“Earlier, I talked nicely to him, but not only did he humiliate me, he humiliated Young Master too!” That earlier youth, embellished his stories with more lies, as he regarded the Young Master.<br></p>
  <p>“Ah Wang, step down!” The Young Master lightly commanded.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>After which, he directed his gaze at Qing Shui. Upon seeing Wenren Wu-Shuang, his expression flickered, but he still kept his gaze on Qing Shui. “Doctor, I apologize for the actions of my subordinate.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui cast a glance at that Young Master, “It’s fine, however I’m trying to run a clinic here. Are you intending to smash my clinic by bringing so many men over with you?”</p>
  <p>The Young Master froze, before glancing at his men behind him. “Go back, didn’t I tell you guys not to follow me? Why are you guys still following me? Ah Wang, lead them back.”</p>
  <p>“Young Master, Master commanded before, they are not allowed to leave the side of Young Master.”</p>
  <p>“Are you saying that my words are useless?” The countenance of the Young Master grew cold.</p>
  <p>“Okay okay, we will return now. Everyone, return!” Ah Wang helplessly cast a glance at the Young Master, as they unwillingly departed the area.</p>
  <p>“Doctor you see…”</p>
  <p>“Okay good job, you can leave now, I’m very busy!” Qing Shui lazily interrupted the words of the Young Master, causing the Young Master to freeze where he stood.l</p>
  <p>“Doctor, I’m really very sincerely requesting for help.”</p>
  <p>“There are three instances where I don’t provide consultations. You were unlucky today.” Qing Shui spoke as he glanced at Wu-Shuang, who was almost bursting out with laughter.</p>
  <p>“Ah! Doctor, could you tell me what were the three instances? This way, I would come only when you are available.” The Young Master immediately struck the nail on the head, and asked directly.</p>
  <p>“First instance: when I’m chatting with beautiful girls. Second instance: when the patient is unlikable to me. Third instance: when I’m in a bad mood. Regretfully, today your luck was bad, you clashed with all three instances.” Qing Shui didn’t even open his eyes, as he stated.</p>
  <p>The Young Master stupidly stood there, while Wu-Shuang burst out in laughter, as she glanced at that depressed Young Master.</p>
  <p>The expressions on the countenance of that Young Master became ‘slow’, as he stared dumbly at the sight of Wu-shuang laughing, he couldn’t help but feel awe in his heart.</p>
  <p>“Discontinue staring at my woman. Be careful that I don’t throw you out.” A light voice drifted over, into the eardrums of that Young Master.</p>
  <p>“Ah!”</p>
  <p>“Ah, I don’t mean anything by it, your wife is simply too beautiful. It was unintentional.” The Young Master awkwardly replied.</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang, after making a slight noise of shock, rolled her eyes at Qing Shui, causing Qing Shui’s heart to beat faster as he realized that Wu-shuang didn’t refute Young Master’s words. Apparently, she felt that there was no need.</p>
  <p>“Doctor, I…”</p>
  <p>“Fine, if you want me to cure your illness then half a month later bring some 2,000 year old herbs over, thousand-year ginseng, and thousand-year snow lotus. Remember this, otherwise, don’t bother me. I’m only giving you one chance. By the way, your illness can only be cured by me. You don’t need to say anything else, please return.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p>Respect flickered in that Young Master’s eyes before he bowed as he departed.</p>
  <p>“You mean you know what illness he has?” Wu-shuang questioned disbelievingly.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, he was born with a lack of Yang Element in his body. His manhood is unable to get hard, and he is unable to enjoy the joy of union between man and woman.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p>“You are getting naughtier and naughtier. In the future, you are not allowed to say these types of things in front of me.” Wenren Wu-shuang’s face was like a radiant sun, it was unknown if this was because of Qing Shui words, or because she thought of something.</p>
  <p>“But your request was too excessive, how do you know that he can afford to pay that up?” Wenren Wu-shuang realized that Qing Shui was very interesting. This intelligent and wayward little man always gave her surprises.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, the status of that Young Master from earlier should be extraordinary. Those bodyguards of his earlier, there were three Xiantian levels mixed in while the rest were at the peak of Houtian. Although I can’t be sure of what exactly his strength is, he is undoubtedly also at the Xiantian level.” Qing Shu’s Heavenly Vision Technique could enable him to roughly gauge the strength of other cultivators.</p>
  <p>“Oh, okay. I shall look for you tomorrow before we set out for the Golden Ring Valley!” Wu-shuang smiled, as she departed.</p>
  <p>Looking at the amount of earnings he made today: a stack of copper coins, Qing Shui was uncertain how he should feel. He didn’t want to accept money, but the poor patients kept insisting on paying. As such, he decided to charge them a copper coin each, and just treat it as though he was accumulating some good karma for himself.</p>
  <p>After locking the doors, Qing Shui tidied up the bottles of Golden Sore Ointment. He wasn’t too worried that there would be theft, after all, there was nothing that could be considered valuable here.</p>
  <p>The skies had already darkened as the rays from the setting sun painted the city grounds a beautiful color. Qing Shui strolled about in the streets, feeling calm. This type of feeling was extremely miraculous, and even gave him a sense of bliss in his heart.</p>
  <p>Although Qing Shui was doing consultation work earlier, he was not tired at all. After returning to the Qing Clan Medicinal Hall, Qing Yi was actually hugging an adorable looking little girl with makeup, playing with her.</p>
  <p>After noticing Qing Shui, that little girl happily called out daddy, while Qing Yi laughed as she looked at Qing Shui. Looking at the awkward expression on the face of her son was pretty amusing.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, hug, hug!’</p>
  <p>Maybe it was because of the natural disposition of Qing Shui, or maybe it was because Qing Shui would always transfuse the energy from the Ancient Strengthening Technique to her. The adorable little girl and Qing Shui had developed a unique relationship, to the extent where their closeness didn’t lose out to the closeness of kinship!</p>
  <p>Or maybe it was because Qing Shui was the one who saved the little girl from the clutches of death. In the little girl’s heart, Qing Shui had already taken on an immensely important position.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui laughingly grabbed hold of Yuchang, “Mother, I need to make a trip tomorrow, and will only be back after half a month’s time.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, okay remember to be careful and take care of yourself! I shall cook something good tonight, so everyone can chat and have a happy meal together.”</p>
  <p>“Lass, where is your mother?” Qing Shui embraced the little girl as he spun around in circles.</p>
  <p>“Wash, clothes!” Were it not for the frequent interactions between Qing Shui and the girl, he surely would have had trouble understanding what she was saying. Even now, he had to guess and try to comprehend the meaning of the little girl’s speech.</p>
  <p>Bringing the little girl to the washing room, Qing Shui finally spotted Mingyue Gelou. Although Qing Shui could see her daily, he was still attracted by her motherly love and grace. Her exquisite and mature face gave off a feeling as though she would never be angry. Her voluptuous figure was at a standard where she did not lose out to Yu He. Maybe part of the reason was because of the adorable little girl, the motherly grace that emanated from her made Mingyue extremely attractive.</p>
  <p>A woman was considered the most beautiful when she was revealing a love-filled smile while holding onto her child.</p>
  <p>“Sister Mingyue…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui suddenly saw that within that pile of clothes that Mingyue was washing, the robe which he casually discarded in the afternoon was there as well. She should have noticed that.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, Qing Shui you are back already. Are you exhausted?” Mingyue Gelou stood up as she happily spoke.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui quickly glanced at the snowy white arms of Mingyue, as she extended her hand to brush aside a few strands of her dishevelled hair, unintentionally emitting an extremely gentle atmosphere. She appeared saintly, as though there were golden halos surrounding her.</p>
  <p>“Right. Sister Mingyue, don’t bother yourself with my clothes, I’m capable of washing them myself!” Qing Shui somewhat embarrassedly stated.</p>
  <p>“Why are you looking down on this sister? Are you saying that the clothes that I wash are not clean?” As she spoke, Mingyue purposely extended her hand to gently squeeze the nose of the little girl, causing her to giggle while dodging.</p>
  <p>“I wonder if I could ever have such a beautiful wife and adorable daughter such as Mingyue and Yuchang. I would surely be very blessed.” Qing Shui hugged the adorable little girl, as he joked around with the mother daughter duo, as their laughter resounded about. This type of feeling caused Qing Shui to feel extremely warm in his heart.</p>
  <p>“How would I look down on sister. It’s just that the weather is cold, and the water may hurt your hands. If other people saw this, they may say that instead of protecting you, I’m bullying you instead.” Qing Shui teased.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, a woman like me, no one would bother about it anyway. Thank you for saving the little lass. Your kindness to sister, I will never be able to repay it in this lifetime.” Mingyue Gelou smiled.</p>
  <p>“Hah, I’ve said before, I’m connected by fate with her. No matter what, where or when the little lass could be considered my kin. Anyway, sister you are still in your prime,so you must not be too negative. Treat yourself and the little lass well, and don’t think about other negative things too much. No matter what you need help with, just remember to look for me, otherwise, I would be angry!”</p>
  <p>It was impossible for Mingyue not to be moved after hearing Qing Shui words. Her gratitude was indescribable, akin to when a person sent coal in the middle of winter. She had also tried to analyze the motives of Qing Shui, on why he wanted to do this. If it was because of her beauty, she could accept his will with no hesitation. This wasn’t because Qing Shui was cheap and horny, but because of the gratitude in her heart.</p>
  <p>“Sister Mingyue, I will need to be away from here for about half a month. You don’t need to worry about the condition of the little lass. Just stay here until I’m back and treat it like your own home.” Qing Shui knew that Mingyue only had her daughter as her only remaining kin. A weak woman bringing along a child, how tough would it be if they wanted to survive?</p>
  <p>On the 2nd morning, Wenren Wu-shuang arrived at the Qing Clan’s Medical Store early in the morning. After Mingyue noticed Qing Shui together with such a celestial beauty, her heart suddenly understood. Qing Shui indeed had the heart of a doctor, and really offered his help because he truly cared about her, and not because of her beauty. Just thinking of her daughter calling him “daddy”, left Mingyue with a feeling of being blessed, as she let out a pure and carefree smile was displayed on her visage.</p>
  <p>At the same time, Qing Shui also felt that only a woman like this, possessed the qualifications to be worthy of him!</p>

 <p>“Doctor, I’m really very sincerely requesting for help.”</p>
 <p>“There are three instances where I don’t provide consultations. You were unlucky today.” Qing Shui spoke as he glanced at Wu-Shuang, who was almost bursting out with laughter.</p>
 <p>“Ah! Doctor, could you tell me what were the three instances? This way, I would come only when you are available.” The Young Master immediately struck the nail on the head, and asked directly.</p>
 <p>“First instance: when I’m chatting with beautiful girls. Second instance: when the patient is unlikable to me. Third instance: when I’m in a bad mood. Regretfully, today your luck was bad, you clashed with all three instances.” Qing Shui didn’t even open his eyes, as he stated.</p>
 <p>The Young Master stupidly stood there, while Wu-Shuang burst out in laughter, as she glanced at that depressed Young Master.</p>
 <p>The expressions on the countenance of that Young Master became ‘slow’, as he stared dumbly at the sight of Wu-shuang laughing, he couldn’t help but feel awe in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Discontinue staring at my woman. Be careful that I don’t throw you out.” A light voice drifted over, into the eardrums of that Young Master.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>“Ah, I don’t mean anything by it, your wife is simply too beautiful. It was unintentional.” The Young Master awkwardly replied.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang, after making a slight noise of shock, rolled her eyes at Qing Shui, causing Qing Shui’s heart to beat faster as he realized that Wu-shuang didn’t refute Young Master’s words. Apparently, she felt that there was no need.</p>
 <p>“Doctor, I…”</p>
 <p>“Fine, if you want me to cure your illness then half a month later bring some 2,000 year old herbs over, thousand-year ginseng, and thousand-year snow lotus. Remember this, otherwise, don’t bother me. I’m only giving you one chance. By the way, your illness can only be cured by me. You don’t need to say anything else, please return.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Respect flickered in that Young Master’s eyes before he bowed as he departed.</p>
 <p>“You mean you know what illness he has?” Wu-shuang questioned disbelievingly.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, he was born with a lack of Yang Element in his body. His manhood is unable to get hard, and he is unable to enjoy the joy of union between man and woman.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“You are getting naughtier and naughtier. In the future, you are not allowed to say these types of things in front of me.” Wenren Wu-shuang’s face was like a radiant sun, it was unknown if this was because of Qing Shui words, or because she thought of something.</p>
 <p>“But your request was too excessive, how do you know that he can afford to pay that up?” Wenren Wu-shuang realized that Qing Shui was very interesting. This intelligent and wayward little man always gave her surprises.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, the status of that Young Master from earlier should be extraordinary. Those bodyguards of his earlier, there were three Xiantian levels mixed in while the rest were at the peak of Houtian. Although I can’t be sure of what exactly his strength is, he is undoubtedly also at the Xiantian level.” Qing Shu’s Heavenly Vision Technique could enable him to roughly gauge the strength of other cultivators.</p>
 <p>“Oh, okay. I shall look for you tomorrow before we set out for the Golden Ring Valley!” Wu-shuang smiled, as she departed.</p>
 <p>Looking at the amount of earnings he made today: a stack of copper coins, Qing Shui was uncertain how he should feel. He didn’t want to accept money, but the poor patients kept insisting on paying. As such, he decided to charge them a copper coin each, and just treat it as though he was accumulating some good karma for himself.</p>
 <p>After locking the doors, Qing Shui tidied up the bottles of Golden Sore Ointment. He wasn’t too worried that there would be theft, after all, there was nothing that could be considered valuable here.</p>
 <p>The skies had already darkened as the rays from the setting sun painted the city grounds a beautiful color. Qing Shui strolled about in the streets, feeling calm. This type of feeling was extremely miraculous, and even gave him a sense of bliss in his heart.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui was doing consultation work earlier, he was not tired at all. After returning to the Qing Clan Medicinal Hall, Qing Yi was actually hugging an adorable looking little girl with makeup, playing with her.</p>
 <p>After noticing Qing Shui, that little girl happily called out daddy, while Qing Yi laughed as she looked at Qing Shui. Looking at the awkward expression on the face of her son was pretty amusing.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, hug, hug!’</p>
 <p>Maybe it was because of the natural disposition of Qing Shui, or maybe it was because Qing Shui would always transfuse the energy from the Ancient Strengthening Technique to her. The adorable little girl and Qing Shui had developed a unique relationship, to the extent where their closeness didn’t lose out to the closeness of kinship!</p>
 <p>Or maybe it was because Qing Shui was the one who saved the little girl from the clutches of death. In the little girl’s heart, Qing Shui had already taken on an immensely important position.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughingly grabbed hold of Yuchang, “Mother, I need to make a trip tomorrow, and will only be back after half a month’s time.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, okay remember to be careful and take care of yourself! I shall cook something good tonight, so everyone can chat and have a happy meal together.”</p>
 <p>“Lass, where is your mother?” Qing Shui embraced the little girl as he spun around in circles.</p>
 <p>“Wash, clothes!” Were it not for the frequent interactions between Qing Shui and the girl, he surely would have had trouble understanding what she was saying. Even now, he had to guess and try to comprehend the meaning of the little girl’s speech.</p>
 <p>Bringing the little girl to the washing room, Qing Shui finally spotted Mingyue Gelou. Although Qing Shui could see her daily, he was still attracted by her motherly love and grace. Her exquisite and mature face gave off a feeling as though she would never be angry. Her voluptuous figure was at a standard where she did not lose out to Yu He. Maybe part of the reason was because of the adorable little girl, the motherly grace that emanated from her made Mingyue extremely attractive.</p>
 <p>A woman was considered the most beautiful when she was revealing a love-filled smile while holding onto her child.</p>
 <p>“Sister Mingyue…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly saw that within that pile of clothes that Mingyue was washing, the robe which he casually discarded in the afternoon was there as well. She should have noticed that.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, Qing Shui you are back already. Are you exhausted?” Mingyue Gelou stood up as she happily spoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly glanced at the snowy white arms of Mingyue, as she extended her hand to brush aside a few strands of her dishevelled hair, unintentionally emitting an extremely gentle atmosphere. She appeared saintly, as though there were golden halos surrounding her.</p>
 <p>“Right. Sister Mingyue, don’t bother yourself with my clothes, I’m capable of washing them myself!” Qing Shui somewhat embarrassedly stated.</p>
 <p>“Why are you looking down on this sister? Are you saying that the clothes that I wash are not clean?” As she spoke, Mingyue purposely extended her hand to gently squeeze the nose of the little girl, causing her to giggle while dodging.</p>
 <p>“I wonder if I could ever have such a beautiful wife and adorable daughter such as Mingyue and Yuchang. I would surely be very blessed.” Qing Shui hugged the adorable little girl, as he joked around with the mother daughter duo, as their laughter resounded about. This type of feeling caused Qing Shui to feel extremely warm in his heart.</p>
 <p>“How would I look down on sister. It’s just that the weather is cold, and the water may hurt your hands. If other people saw this, they may say that instead of protecting you, I’m bullying you instead.” Qing Shui teased.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, a woman like me, no one would bother about it anyway. Thank you for saving the little lass. Your kindness to sister, I will never be able to repay it in this lifetime.” Mingyue Gelou smiled.</p>
 <p>“Hah, I’ve said before, I’m connected by fate with her. No matter what, where or when the little lass could be considered my kin. Anyway, sister you are still in your prime,so you must not be too negative. Treat yourself and the little lass well, and don’t think about other negative things too much. No matter what you need help with, just remember to look for me, otherwise, I would be angry!”</p>
 <p>It was impossible for Mingyue not to be moved after hearing Qing Shui words. Her gratitude was indescribable, akin to when a person sent coal in the middle of winter. She had also tried to analyze the motives of Qing Shui, on why he wanted to do this. If it was because of her beauty, she could accept his will with no hesitation. This wasn’t because Qing Shui was cheap and horny, but because of the gratitude in her heart.</p>
 <p>“Sister Mingyue, I will need to be away from here for about half a month. You don’t need to worry about the condition of the little lass. Just stay here until I’m back and treat it like your own home.” Qing Shui knew that Mingyue only had her daughter as her only remaining kin. A weak woman bringing along a child, how tough would it be if they wanted to survive?</p>
 <p>On the 2nd morning, Wenren Wu-shuang arrived at the Qing Clan’s Medical Store early in the morning. After Mingyue noticed Qing Shui together with such a celestial beauty, her heart suddenly understood. Qing Shui indeed had the heart of a doctor, and really offered his help because he truly cared about her, and not because of her beauty. Just thinking of her daughter calling him “daddy”, left Mingyue with a feeling of being blessed, as she let out a pure and carefree smile was displayed on her visage.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui also felt that only a woman like this, possessed the qualifications to be worthy of him!</p>
