  <p><strong>AST 0060 – The Dao of Money Making</strong></p>
  <p><span style>“Are the relationships between the four great clans harmonious?” Qing Shui asked. In his mind he didn’t think that they would be, after all, the four clans are direct competitors against each other in Hundred Miles City!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The relations between the &nbsp;four great clans, are bound together for good or ill, seemingly like grasshoppers competing with each other while standing on a string. Despite their intense rivalry, there are also inter-clan marriage engagements between the four clans. An example, from the current generation it would be Situ Bu Fan from the Situ Clan and Shi Qing Zhuang from the Shi Clan. Thus, the relationship between the four clans could only be described as kinship, but with a touch of enmity embedded within. </span></p>
  <p><i><span style>“No wonder Shi Qing Zhuang couldn’t be bothered with Situ Bu Fan, after all, it was an arranged marriage. Could her cold personality stem from this?</span></i><span style>” Qing Shui, knew that Shi Qing Zhuang had already left a extremely deep impression in his heart. Try as he might, there was no way he would be able to forget about her. As such, he was extremely concerned with everything that had to do with Shi Qing Zhuang.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Could the economic strength wielded by the clans in the Qing Village that are doing business here in Hundred Miles City, be compared the the economic strength of the four great clans?” Qing Shui knew that other than his Qing Clan, there were also the Lan Clan, Tong Clan and Feng Clan who have businesses here at Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, even if all the clans in the Qing Village combined together, we would not be a match for any of the great clans in Hundred Miles City. Despite this, your grandpa is still someone at the peak of Houtian. Even if they ignore this fact, they would still have to be careful not to antagonize us any further than necessary as they also know about the relationship between our Qing Clan and the Hua Clan of Heavenly River City.” Qing Yi explained.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You don’t have to worry about the older generations of the four clans, they would not have the guts to deal with you. But still, you have to be careful of the schemes of those from the younger generations. Especially, Situ Luan from the Situ Clan as well as Ding Lang from the Ding Clan. They are extremely strong. Both of them have talent comparable to your 2nd uncle, and have a high possibility of stepping into the peak of Houtian, by the age of 40.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui already expected this much. He knew that the reason Qing Yi was telling him all this was because she was worried for him. Showing a carefree expression, Qing Shui smiled lightly as he reassured Qing Yi.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Yi felt that something was off with Qing Shui, as if he had some secrets that he was not sharing with her. For no reason at all, this child of her seemed to be filled with boundless confidence, as if he was a totally different person. &nbsp;If it were not for the fact that blood runs thick and she could feel a connection with Qing Shui, she would surely have suspected that the person in front of her was a stranger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Recently Qing Shui felt that making money was a good thing, but the him now could only be considered extremely poor. All his future riches would be generated from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal but… that was in the future. Now, even if he wanted to buy things from the streets, he would have no capital to do so. Not to mention that the memories he unlocked earlier, all those jewerly cutting, jewelry smithing techniques were all useless if he could not even purchase the raw materials.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Still, things were not as bad as they seemed on the surface. He would only need to wait a few more years to rake in the money with the help of the time-dilation effect of his spatial realm. The problem is right now! </span><i><span style>I can’t open my mouth and ask for money from Mother every time right? She had just given me a 100 taels of silver just two days ago!” </span></i><span style>Before this, Qing Shui had no concept of money, after all, he had been living in the Qing Clan, where all his needs had been catered for. Now that he had arrived in Hundred Miles City, he began to understand the value of money. A banknote of 100 taels, was sufficient to feed a family of five for half a month. You could even visit the “Night Fragrance Court” (brothel) to enjoy the services of their top class escorts for a single night.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As he strolled, Qing Shui begin to think of ways of making money. Walking around aimlessly on the streets of the prosperous Hundred Miles City meant time passed quickly, and it was already evening in the blink of an eye. The atmosphere on the streets in the Hundred Miles City was always lively. In the surroundings, there were the voices of sellers trying to attract potential customers over, while crowds of people swamped the streets. This was not chaotic, but instead it made it easier for one to adapt to the lively atmosphere of the city. As he wandered, Qing Shui suddenly came to a stop. On the side of the street, there was an old granny as well as a cute little girl seemingly selling three large buckets of water.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui noticed this duo because they were very striking among the swathes of vendors on the streets. The old granny who was missing an arm, was accompanied by a little girl approximately the age of 10. Even though the clothes worn by the little girl were somewhat worn, they were not filled with dirt or stains and were extremely clean. With a pair of bright eyes flitting about that were filled with curiosity, and long eyelashes that were blinking constantly, she was extremely adorable. However, from judging from the hard-set of her cherry small mouth, one could tell how obstinate the girl could be.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With his interest piqued, Qing Shui approached the three large water buckets, only to see that contained within them, was 10 over thumb-sized little black fishes as well as a few baby river turtles. As Qing Shui squatted down to inspect closer, he could see the hope-filled gaze apparent in the eyes of the little girl.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui felt bitterness invading his heart. He was neither a good man nor an evil man. He never had any intention to rescue all of the people who were suffering in this world. Although he could still do his best if he encountered any who truly needed his help.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had always wanted to test and see if the mystical water from the crystal pond was capable of sustaining the growth of animals… Seems like the opportunity to do so has come.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Little sister, can you tell me the prices for these fishes and turtles?” Qing Shui asked with a gentle expression in his eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The little girl adorably blinked her eyes as she continued to stare at Qing Shui, “Big Brother, you are not lying right? Do you really want to buy them?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>All of the little fishes and turtles were caught by the little girl using a small net. Since the size of the merchandise was too small to be eaten, the little girl suggested for her granny to set up a store, trying to sell them as pets instead.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yup, of course I want to, night is soon approaching, don’t you want to go back and rest with your granny?” Qing Shui laughed lightly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“All these were caught by Ni`er from the creekside, if big brother wants them, Ni`er could show you the location for catching the fishes and turtles, there is no need to spend money on them!” That young lady named Ni`er exclaimed seriously, with a touch of innocence in her eyes, as she smiled, revealing her two adorable tiger teeth. [1]</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh, but I specifically want the fishes and turtles you have here. Can big brother combine the 3 buckets of water into one and pay you two taels of silver for them?” After he finished his sentence, Qing Shui directly poured the contents of the two other water buckets, combining them into one, as he withdrew the last of his money and passed the two taels of silver over to that little girl.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Big brother… Two taels of silver is too much, these fishes and turtles are not so expensive….” The little girl frantically waved her hands in disagreement, as she took a step backwards.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, found that his liking of the personality of this little girl grew by the second, as he smiled and replied, “Silly girl, big brother says it is worth that much. Take it, go buy something good for your granny to eat.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The little girl hesitated for a long while, before gradually accepting: “Big brother, what is your name, how can I find you?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My name is Qing Shui, if you want to look for big brother, just go to the Qing Clan’s Medical Store. Little sister, if you need any help, no matter how big or small, you can look for me, got it?” Qing Shui patted Ni`er on her head as he continued smiling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Okay, I’ve got it, big brother!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After which, Qing Shui saw the little girl holding the two empty buckets of water with one hand while supporting her granny with the other, slowly leaving the streets. But after the little girl took a few steps, she turned her head back and gazed at Qing Shui, with a wide smile breaking out on her face, revealing her adorable tiger teeth once again.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The setting sun caused their shadows to be lengthened, before their silhouettes finally disappeared from the streets.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After that, Qing Shui walked to a remote location, and entered into his spatial realm while holding the bucket of water, containing the fishes and turtles which he just bought. Walking to the center of the crystal pond, he first released a little turtle into the water.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm” Qing Shui gazed at the little river turtle swimming about in the water, after a short moment, the turtle appear to be seemingly more energetic and agile than before.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was extremely excited, the effect of the time-dilation seemed even better for rearing animals than herbs. Especially for fishes, he would just need to rear them in the crystal pond for three days before they are ready to be ate. </span></p>
  <p><span style>His eyes grew bright as a sudden thought flashed past in his brain. This was it! This was the way to grow rich! I just need a supply of these small fishes. Hehehehe, I better think of a good explanation, if not there would certainly be people suspicious.</span></p>

 <p><span style>The little girl adorably blinked her eyes as she continued to stare at Qing Shui, “Big Brother, you are not lying right? Do you really want to buy them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the little fishes and turtles were caught by the little girl using a small net. Since the size of the merchandise was too small to be eaten, the little girl suggested for her granny to set up a store, trying to sell them as pets instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup, of course I want to, night is soon approaching, don’t you want to go back and rest with your granny?” Qing Shui laughed lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All these were caught by Ni`er from the creekside, if big brother wants them, Ni`er could show you the location for catching the fishes and turtles, there is no need to spend money on them!” That young lady named Ni`er exclaimed seriously, with a touch of innocence in her eyes, as she smiled, revealing her two adorable tiger teeth. [1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, but I specifically want the fishes and turtles you have here. Can big brother combine the 3 buckets of water into one and pay you two taels of silver for them?” After he finished his sentence, Qing Shui directly poured the contents of the two other water buckets, combining them into one, as he withdrew the last of his money and passed the two taels of silver over to that little girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother… Two taels of silver is too much, these fishes and turtles are not so expensive….” The little girl frantically waved her hands in disagreement, as she took a step backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui, found that his liking of the personality of this little girl grew by the second, as he smiled and replied, “Silly girl, big brother says it is worth that much. Take it, go buy something good for your granny to eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little girl hesitated for a long while, before gradually accepting: “Big brother, what is your name, how can I find you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Qing Shui, if you want to look for big brother, just go to the Qing Clan’s Medical Store. Little sister, if you need any help, no matter how big or small, you can look for me, got it?” Qing Shui patted Ni`er on her head as he continued smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I’ve got it, big brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After which, Qing Shui saw the little girl holding the two empty buckets of water with one hand while supporting her granny with the other, slowly leaving the streets. But after the little girl took a few steps, she turned her head back and gazed at Qing Shui, with a wide smile breaking out on her face, revealing her adorable tiger teeth once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The setting sun caused their shadows to be lengthened, before their silhouettes finally disappeared from the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Qing Shui walked to a remote location, and entered into his spatial realm while holding the bucket of water, containing the fishes and turtles which he just bought. Walking to the center of the crystal pond, he first released a little turtle into the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm” Qing Shui gazed at the little river turtle swimming about in the water, after a short moment, the turtle appear to be seemingly more energetic and agile than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was extremely excited, the effect of the time-dilation seemed even better for rearing animals than herbs. Especially for fishes, he would just need to rear them in the crystal pond for three days before they are ready to be ate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes grew bright as a sudden thought flashed past in his brain. This was it! This was the way to grow rich! I just need a supply of these small fishes. Hehehehe, I better think of a good explanation, if not there would certainly be people suspicious.</span></p>
