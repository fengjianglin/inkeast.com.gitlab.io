 <p><strong>AST 1356 - Snake Form, Spiritual Snake Whip, Snake Elephant Inheritance, Blood Essence Demon’s Goblet</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui also didn’t know how he got stopped by her. He wasn’t really worried, it’s just that he didn’t understand why she wanted to stop him. Hence, he opened his mouth and asked, “Little girl, why did you try to stop me?”</p>
 <p>“Uncle and aunty, I, think that you both look like good people. How about this, in the future, you can hang out with me,” the girl told Qing Shui</p>
 <p>Her expression looked relaxed and contented but at the same time, it also felt really serious, so much so that Qing Shui didn’t know if she was purposely doing it or if it was just that simple.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su was smiling at the corner while looking at Qing Shui. She seemed to also feel really curious. She wanted to see how Qing Shui would settle the problem in front of him. Furthermore, she had also noticed that from time to time, the girl would gaze at her.</p>
 <p>“So I will have to hang out with you just because you look good?” Qing Shui smiled. Qing Shui felt that the girl should be from quite a decent family background. The reason being that the girl had quite a decent cultivation. The fact that she could riot across the street in a country city already meant that she was definitely not a girl from ordinary family.</p>
 <p>“Sister Dai, this man is not giving you any face. Let me help you teach him a lesson!” A teenager behind the girl said to her softly but his voice could be heard clearly by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Go, remember to use your strongest technique,” the girl said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I know.”</p>
 <p>The teenager looked really muscular and sturdy. He was almost as tall as Qing Shui. Other than having delicate features, there was an unswerving determination in his eyes.</p>
 <p>With both of his hands pulled back, carrying along a dark red colored shadow, his movements were like those of a python’s tongue. An ice cold penetrating aura could be felt spreading into the surroundings. Both of his hands were like two enormous pythons revolving in circles.</p>
 <p>Elephant Form Snake King Fist!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s eyes shone as he gently flicked one of his hands. As he did so, that hand of his instantaneously turned into something resembling that of an Immortal Crane. Then, the moment when he thrust it out, it immediately formed into two cranes and together, pecked the teenager.</p>
 <p>Pa-pa!</p>
 <p>After just two light noises, the teenager revealed a bitter smile and bowed down to Qing Shui, “Thank you for showing mercy.”</p>
 <p>Both of the teenager’s arms were already slightly swollen. They felt incomparably sore.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and didn’t say anything. He moved his sight to the girl. A snow white long whip suddenly popped up out of nowhere in the girl’s hand. It was bright and shining with light, giving off a brilliant aura.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, I know that you are really formidable. Will you dare to fight me at a strength almost equivalent to mine?” The girl knitted her brows and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Spill it, I know you wouldn’t stop me for nothing. So long as you speak the truth, I will accept your request,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You are Miraculous Physician Qing, aren’t you?!” the little girl asked softly.</p>
 <p>“You should already have an answer for this,” Qing Shui said with a smile. Despite this, he still felt really shocked deep down. His name had actually been spread so widely.</p>
 <p>“Actually, the reason why I stopped you is so that you can help my father with the illness he got……” the little girl said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui was already able to tell that this little girl wasn’t a disobedient girl. This was because of her eyes. The eyes of a person could never deceive others. The expression hidden within their eyes were the truest thoughts which a human had.</p>
 <p>“Why would you use this kind of method to look for me? Are you planning to challenge me?” Or are you planning to let me cure your father?” Qing Shui asked while looking at the girl and smiling.</p>
 <p>“It has always been said that doctors tend to have short tempers. They wouldn’t bother talking to a person if the person tried to invite them over nicely. Hence, I wanted to defeat you before letting you go and examine my father’s illness.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head. Sometimes, he really found it hard to understand how a little girl tended to think. He nodded, “Alright, let’s have a match then. I will definitely not use a strength which is beyond your capability.”</p>
 <p>The little girl nodded. After that, she started moving her body.</p>
 <p>Beautiful Snake Woman!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now discovered that the little girl was using the Snake Step. If he wasn’t mistaken, the little girl should be practicing the Snake Form.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui’s Nine Animals Mimicry Technique may not have included the Snake Form, he was aware that in his previous incarnation, there was a form like this. Hence, regarding this form, he still had a bit of knowledge about it.</p>
 <p>Snake Fist Practitioners have to have an extremely agile and flexible body, able to be in one’s element when on the ground, able to stretch and coil, and able to turn and bend.</p>
 <p>Snakes have the ability to traverse effortlessly through the grass, flying gracefully. There’s a saying that humans who run might not even be as fast as a snake who crawls when they are in a grassy area.</p>
 <p>It’s hard to imagine. Snakes didn’t possess legs, yet they are able to move in a way which seems like flying. The speed at which it attacked was fast like lightning. This was its unique ability. It’s said that once a snake dug into a hole with its tail being grabbed, even if one was to separate it away from its body, they still wouldn’t manage to pull it out.</p>
 <p>The mighty snake was capable of winding itself around its prey to hunt for it. It would wrap around its opponent, causing them to not be able to breathe and as a result die from it.</p>
 <p>The strength of the Snake Form consisted of both vertical and horizontal movements. When used, the user would be able to move smoothly and easily. Furthermore, they would also be able to draw out strength of just the right amount. The user would transfer the strength of both of their legs all the way up to their arms and let their waist control their entire movement.</p>
 <p>The girl on the other hand, had shown herself to be totally different from this. Her body movement was very agile and dazzling. In between her steps, there was a kind of charm which words couldn’t describe. At the same time, the whips in her hands were like two snakes that were intertwining between themselves, unleashing their attacks.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s eyes shone. The Spiritual Qi across this world was very abundant. In his previous life, he was limited from doing anything. Similarly, none of the Sect Masters from his previous lifetime were able to make it through to Xiantian Realm. At the very least, Qing Shui had never heard about it. But things were different in the nine continents.</p>
 <p>Dragon Roaming Step!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a feeling that his own footwork was very similar to the girl’s Snake Step from before. In between advancing forward and retreating backward, he had already performed more than ten techniques. Qing Shui was performing the Taichi Fist. Basically, he wasn’t using any strength.</p>
 <p>The little girl was still considered to be quite good. Despite her young age, she was already a Martial Saint Warrior. Merely by this, Qing Shui could already tell that she was absolutely not from an ordinary clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha, his daughter was also actually quite similar to this girl. She was almost the same age as the little girl. But she was already a long way ahead of warriors same age as her.</p>
 <p>The grade of Snake Fist used by the little girl was very high. Her fine and delicate techniques had also made Qing Shui feel that he might want to research them.</p>
 <p>Spirited Snake Out Of Cave!</p>
 <p>Dragon Snake Flight!</p>
 <p>Snake Scorpion Heart!</p>
 <p>Snake’s Appetite Swallowing the Elephant!</p>
 <p>Spirited Snake into Dragon!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Thank you, I am a long way away from you in terms of strength.” The girl stopped her attacks.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, was unable to stay calm. He mustn’t look down on anyone at anytime. He mustn’t look down on people weaker than himself, the reason being that today, he had learned a lot of things.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Dragon Whip!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Primordial Flame Dragon Whip had always lacked agile techniques. Even though he had the Primordial Flame Dragon Drill, it wasn’t such a useful technique. But now, things were different. Prior to this, the Spirited Snake Whip which the girl unleashed made him feel really surprised. If he understood the principles behind it, at the very least, the power he could draw out when using Primordial Flame Dragon Whip would definitely be a lot more powerful than before.</p>
 <p>“You are really something. Let’s go. Bring me to see your daddy. I promised to cure him.” Qing Shui considered this as a way to thank the little girl.</p>
 <p>“Ah, you promised to cure my daddy?” The girl looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
 <p>“I just think that you are living in an extremely miserable state now… but with your father around, there wouldn’t be as many people who would dare to bully you,” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Who would dare to bully me? Mei Clan isn’t a clan that can be bullied so easily,” the little girl said arrogantly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He gestured to Yuan Su and after that, walked together with Mei Dai towards Mei Clan.</p>
 <p>The girl’s name was very special. She was called Mei Dai. She was a very active girl.</p>
 <p>Mei Clan was a huge clan. They had an enormous courtyard and there was a huge snake elephant in the sky. Upon seeing this, Qing Shui was stunned, the reason being that this elephant possessed too much impact force. If Qing Shui was to switch the dragon’s head of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant with the snake’s head, it would have been a snake turtle.</p>
 <p>The snake head as well as neck of this statue was five hundred meters long. Its body was a three hundred meter long, enormous elephant body. It had the agility of a snake and the massive size of an elephant. Could this clan be from Snake Elephant Inheritance? No wonder previously, Mei Dai mentioned something like who would dare to bully her.</p>
 <p>Cranes were the natural enemy of snakes. What would happen if Heavenly Crane was to face off against Snake Elephant? Heavenly Crane was a kind of powerful Spiritual Battle Beast. So was the Snake Elephant. Considering the level they had reached, it was unlikely that things like natural-born enemies would still exist.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>Upon stepping into Mei Clan, the aura which Qing Shui felt, was very haunting, tricky, secretive and unpredictable. It was calm but seemed like it was ready to initiate attacks at anytime. One strike of it would have been fatal.</p>
 <p>“What has happened with your father?” Qing Shui asked while walking into Mei Clan.</p>
 <p>“He has been poisoned!” the girl said in a depressed tone.</p>
 <p>The girl seemed to hold a decent position in Mei Clan. Everyone would greet her happily. They were very easy-going and she would also be very friendly when she addressed some of her uncles and aunties. She didn’t show even the slightest bit of arrogance in her.</p>
 <p>“Little Sister!”</p>
 <p>A rough voice came through!</p>
 <p>“Second Brother!” Mei Dai said happily.</p>
 <p>This was a tall and sturdy man. But he had delicate and pretty brows. He had a muscular build with a delicate and pretty face. But though it might seem delicate, he was considered to have stepped into the middle-aged group.</p>
 <p>“May I know who these people are?”</p>
 <p>“They are the Miraculous Doctors from Imperial Hall in Yehuang Country. They are here to examine daddy’s illness,” Mei Dai quickly explained.</p>
 <p>“*Sigh*, father no longer lets any doctors examine him. He will only let those brought by sister examine him. Sorry for the trouble, Miraculous Physicians,” the man said very sincerely.</p>
 <p>“You are being too modest!”</p>
 <p>“Then we will go in first. Second Brother, come in after a while,” Mei Dai said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Go!” The man smiled and waved his hand.</p>
 <p>Seeing up to this point, Qing Shui already knew that Mei Dai’s father was already unconvinced that anyone could cure the poison. However, he would only allow the doctors whom Mei Dai brought along to examine him. Other than her, he wouldn’t allow the doctors whom other people found to examine him. It was not that he believed in the medical expertise of the doctors whom Mei Dai found, it was just that he really spoiled this daughter of his.</p>
 <p>This was a quiet courtyard.</p>
 <p>Mei Tengfei was Mei Clan’s Clan’s Head. He was Mei Dai’s father. He had eight sons and one daughter in total. The daughter was none other than Mei Dai, she was also the youngest one out of the siblings. She was even younger than the children of his eldest son. Mei Dai was born from the last woman of his who passed away. Seeing that he only managed to get a daughter after he was old, he loved her very dearly.</p>
 <p>The moment when Qing Shui saw Mei Tengfei, he was also stunned. This was a dried up and thin old man. He looked very tired and depressed. Despite this, a dignified aura still lingered around his body but the Blood Essence within his eyes was damaged.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>The moment when Mei Dao saw this old man, she happily smiled and ran off to hug him.</p>
 <p>“Little lass, so you have looked for another doctor to help examine my illness.” The old man smiled as he nodded his head at Qing Shui and Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, the doctor this time is different. He is a real Miraculous Physician. The Miraculous Physician of Imperial Hall from Yehuang Country,” Mei Dai said quickly</p>
 <p>“Oh, so he is skillful enough to be a Miraculous Physician. Unfortunately, my illness is not something which can be cured.” The old man smiled as he extended his dry palm to rub Mei Dai’s head.</p>
 <p>“Let’s give it a try, daddy. The Miraculous Physician is already here. He has cured a lot of fatal illnesses and poisons before. According to the rumors, he is currently helping the eldest prince of Tianhe Clan to treat his illness,” Mei Dai said with eyes filled with hope.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, sorry for the trouble Miraculous Physician. Let’s go sit there.”</p>
 <p>“Who could be so wicked to actually poison you with Blood Essence Demon’s Goblet?” Qing Shui looked at the old man and asked slowly.</p>
