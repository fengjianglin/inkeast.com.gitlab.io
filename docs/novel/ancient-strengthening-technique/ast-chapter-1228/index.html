 <p><strong>AST 1228 - Named Qing Sha, Easy Attack</strong></p>
 <p>The girl's abilities progressed at a tremendous rate. Right now, she was already an Early Grade Three State Master. Even Qing Shui was astonished by the rate of her progress. This was talent, this was bloodline. It was just like how a tiger's cub would have an aura that was unique to a tiger which could cause many wild beasts to flee for their lives.</p>
 <p>The girl seemed to be in such a situation. The Blood Terminator Bead determined her path and destined her for future extraordinariness. She was still so young but already had such astonishing abilities.</p>
 <p>The Spring of Life could remove some of the restrictions in her body, such as those placed on her life. Her lifespan was very low previously but Qing Shui had used fruits such as the Peach of Immortality, and other things to help her increase her lifespan by quite a bit. The Spring of Life had also increased once again it by quite a lot.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>When the little girl regained her senses from her state and she looked at Qing Shui in surprise. Right now, she had a true smile on her face. Looking at this warm smile, Qing Shui realized that he was really very happy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew the reason. The girl had previously looked at this world with a pernicious aura. There was only hatred and disappointment in her life, but she couldn't leave this world. It could be said that she lacked vitality.</p>
 <p>The Spring of Life could replenish a lot of her vitality. Furthermore, with the efforts he had made, she now felt that there was still some warmth and some reliance she could have in this world.</p>
 <p>"How is it? Do you like this present?" Qing Shui smiled and rubbed the little girl's head.</p>
 <p>"I like, I like it a lot. It feels really good." The girl smacked her lips, showing an expression like she hadn't enjoyed it enough.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that feeling, let alone this little kid. After all, she was still young and it was very normal. In this world, Qing Shui was already about forty years old. Although he was still considered to be very, very young in the Nine Continents, after all, he was a soul which came from another world. In his previous life, it would be very normal for one his age to have a kid that was sixteen or seventeen years old. Moreover, his line of thoughts was also around there.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he felt very natural when this girl called him father. Moreover, he already had a number of kids and he didn't find this unnatural.</p>
 <p>"There's no additional effect if you take this again within a short period of time. Have some more after a little while longer." Qing Shui smiled and knocked on her clear forehead. His smile made the girl's smile even brighter.</p>
 <p>"I know that this is something good and should be very rare. To be able to give me a drop shows that father dotes on me a lot." The girl tugged on Qing Shui's sleeve and said happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized that a drop from the Spring of Life really made the girl's character a lot more cheerful. Previously, although they were considered to be on good terms, she wasn't as happy as she was now. It must be because the girl had thought through some things that were burdening her.</p>
 <p>"Lass, it's about time for you to have a name." Qing Shui knew that he should strike while the metal’s hot, and thus he raised this issue up carefully.</p>
 <p>"I like it when father calls me lass. A name isn't important. I'm fine without one." The girl said nonchalantly but Qing Shui could still see a deep sadness in her eyes.</p>
 <p>"Do you have any troubles? Father promises to help you with what you need to do." Qing Shui looked at the girl and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"It's fine. Daughter is in no hurry. I'll settle it myself. I have time anyway." The girl looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile in return.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a sigh. This made it clear that the girl really had something bugging her. He looked at the girl. "Sigh, I'm still going to say the same thing. If you were to go do what you must one day, you must tell me. At the very least, you must let me know."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that it was useless to say anymore right now. Furthermore, it wasn't as if she was going right away. Therefore, he didn't press on.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I'll tell father. How about father give me a name then?" The girl nodded and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"What's your surname?"</p>
 <p>"Since father's surname is Qing, my surname is of course Qing."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned as he looked at the girl. Most people would not change their surnames unless they were not happy with their own family. Could it be that she had a problem with her family? It should be so.</p>
 <p>"Then how about Qing Sha [1]? What do you think of this name?" The reason Qing Shui came up with this name was to constantly remind her that she had a pernicious aura on her.</p>
 <p>"I like this name!" The girl said happily.</p>
 <p>After they had their meal, it was already late morning. Qing Shui helped the girl to strengthen her foundations again, guiding the pernicious aura in her body. The Blood Terminator Bead turned into pernicious aura and moved through her body. Right now, it faintly showed signs of turning into a Blood Terminator Pellet. After it had taken the form of a pellet, it would be different from the pearl state it was in previously.</p>
 <p>There was no righteousness in cultivation, with the exception of heresies' cultivation which might require the use of corpses to cultivate Rotting Corpse Palm or things like that. Martial techniques in itself had no righteousness. The one that was righteous was the human. There were many paths in martial arts and it wasn't necessary for one to make use of heretic means.</p>
 <p>When it was nearing noon, a group of people came to Qing Shui's manor once again. His main door was knocked open violently once again.</p>
 <p>"The one who goes by the Qing surname! Scram out here!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Only then did Qing Shui take out the needles. When he heard the loud noises and the racket, he frowned unhappily. The group from yesterday had left but it seemed that more experts were here today. Otherwise, they wouldn't be so arrogant.</p>
 <p>"Lass, stay here and train. I'll go take a look!"</p>
 <p>"I'll go too!" Qing Sha said quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded helplessly. "Let's go!"</p>
 <p>Qing Sha smiled and grabbed onto Qing Shui's sleeve as they headed out.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and Qing Sha went out, they could see that there were about twenty people standing in the distance. Moreover, he saw Fu Yanting with his first glance. He knew that Fu Yanting must have been unable to hold it in. However, Qing Shui was surprised by the way he had chosen to come.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had originally thought that the other party would come while showing some humility. However, he hadn't expected that Fu Yanting would appear to be even more savage than before. He was the one who had shouted the loudest out of all of them.</p>
 <p>"How dare you mess around with me. I'll let you live a life that's worse than death. If you know what's good for you, you better scram out here and give me treatment."</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui came out, it was just nice that he heard Fu Yanting's shouts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood his feelings as a person who stood high up above others. He was the disciple of Elder Tianyi and his brother was Saint Child Band's Saint Child. He could have everything he asked for. For him to suddenly have his life threatened, by a nobody at that... How could he possibly stay calm?</p>
 <p>"What did you do to me? If you don't come out with it, I'll let you live a life worse than death. Don't doubt my capability to do so." Fu Yanting gritted his teeth as he looked at Qing Shui. It was as if he wished he could pounce at him and tear him into pieces.</p>
 <p>"This is my manor. I'm inviting all of you to leave." Qing Shui walked over with the little girl and said casually.</p>
 <p>He paid no heed to Fu Yanting's shouts and threats. It was as if he didn't exist at all. Fu Yanting felt as if he had landed a punch on air.</p>
 <p>"Young man, it's better to resolve grudges than to make enemies. Please take it on my account and get rid of the restrictions you've placed on him." An old man stood out and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>His voice was very calm and there was a hint of pity in his gaze which was directed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the old man must have felt that he hadn't long to live and thus looked at him with such a gaze. After all, there weren't many people who could keep their lives after offending Fu Yanting.</p>
 <p>"Who are you?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already guessed the old man's identity since the latter was a high level Grade Four State Master. In the past, Qing Shui might have thought that the old man was very strong. However, right now, he felt he could easily decide whether the old man lived or died.</p>
 <p>"I'm Heaven Secrets Academy's Elder Tianyi." When the old man said this, he spoke with arrogance and pride.</p>
 <p>It wasn't easy for a person of Heaven Secrets Academy to become an Elder. Even the lowest level Elder was a powerful existence. It was a symbol of status and glory.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had guessed as much—that the old man was Elder Tianyi. However, his abilities didn't seem to be as great as his reputation. Back when Qing Shui first heard of Elder Tianyi, he felt that his Elder status should be very high and thus so should his abilities.</p>
 <p>However, why did he only seem to be on par with the Eldest Princess before her breakthrough? Then shouldn't he be even further off from the Eldest Princess' teacher? However, now that the Eldest Princess had attained a breakthrough, she should have grown a lot stronger.</p>
 <p>"Oh? Elder Tianyi, are you guys always like this when you go to someone else's place?" Qing Shui looked at the old man. There was no smile nor fury on his face.</p>
 <p>"Alright, young man. This isn't the time for us to dwell on this problem. We're here to get you to treat Young Master Fu." Elder Tianyi didn't seem to be willing to hear what Qing Shui had to say and merely waved his hand and spoke out.</p>
 <p>"Why must I treat him?" Qing Shui rebutted the moment Elder Tianyi finished speaking.</p>
 <p>Elder Tianyi was stunned speechless by Qing Shui's words. As an Elder of the Heaven Secrets Academy, even core disciples would have to treat him with great respect. Elite disciples, high grade disciples, and others would have to be even more respectful toward him.</p>
 <p>In the Heaven Secrets Academy, an Elder was already considered a member of the higher management, an existence which most of the disciples in the Heaven Secrets Academy could only watch in awe. Across the entire Western Oxhe Continent, the Heaven Secrets Academy's Elder was also an existence at the top of the pyramid.</p>
 <p>"Young man, don't act on impulse and be driven by your feelings. You must understand where you stand." The old man frowned. He was clearly very unhappy.</p>
 <p>"Alright, I don't welcome you guys here. It's better that you leave. Don't make it look bad for everyone." Qing Shui really didn't think much of a mere Elder.</p>
 <p>"How dare you! Get him!" Elder Tianyi shouted out angrily.</p>
 <p>The two slightly old men next to him dashed out toward Qing Shui, grabbing toward each of his shoulders.</p>
 <p>"Coming to my place yet raising your hands. Is the Heaven Secrets Academy yours?" Qing Shui causally struck out.</p>
 <p>Taichi Cloud Hands!</p>
 <p>Pa pa!</p>
 <p>Kacha...</p>
 <p>With a casual wave, the two old men from earlier were sent flying. His moves seemed very leisurely but only the two old men knew how terrifying Qing Shui’s prowess was.</p>
 <p>The arms they had reached out with towards Qing Shui had both been broken and they were sent flying while puking blood. Qing Shui had already gone easy on them. Otherwise, they would have died.</p>
 <p>Everyone was astonished at how Qing Shui had seemingly defeated the two old men with great ease. They were so silent that one would even be able to hear the sound of a falling needle. Although the two old men weren't Elders in the Heaven Secrets Academy, their abilities were much stronger than core disciples.</p>
 <p>However, even for people at their level, Qing Shui's casual attacks had dealt them serious injuries!</p>
 <p>Elder Tianyi was astonished. He felt that even he wouldn't be able to defeat those two as cleanly as Qing Shui did. What level was he at? How did he become so powerful despite being at such a young age? Elder Tianyi was even wondering if his eyes were playing tricks on him.</p>
 <p>"Can you leave now? In the future, never be so headstrong when heading toward someone else's place. And, as a senior, you should act like one. If everyone's like you, won't it bring shame to Heaven Secrets Academy?" Qing Shui acted as if nothing had happened but his words showed no mercy.</p>
 <p>[1] The 'Sha' in Qing Sha's name has the same character as pernicious/baleful in pernicious/baleful aura.</p>
