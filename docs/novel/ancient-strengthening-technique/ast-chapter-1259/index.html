 <p><strong>AST 1259 - Heal, Diwu Zhisha, Turning Point</strong></p>
 <p>"Why?" Although Qing Shui had guessed this, he was still a little anxious. After all, it wasn't easy to find a person who could pass a message for him. It also was unknown if Hu Yiya's eldest sister would be coming back this year.</p>
 <p>He could not longer wait nor did he wish to wait more. He had the strength now, but he was unable to find the location of the Lotus Sect. He had never contemplated this problem previously. After all, it was not easy for a great sect to conceal their location. Therefore, he had never considered this before. Eventually, he got to know that even ordinary people didn't know of its location.</p>
 <p>"Ordinary people won't be able to get to meet the Holy Maiden. There's no way to bring a message to her. I've already left the Lotus Sect and I am helpless even if I wish to help you." The lady said, feeling great pity.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated for a moment. He knew that it was basically impossible to ask for the Lotus Sect's location. He could only say, "I'll treat you first. I’ll think of a solution by myself at a later time."</p>
 <p>As she heard Qing Shui's words, the lady was taken aback. She had already said earlier that she would help him on Hu Yimin's account. Although she wasn't able to help him out, she had already done her best. She wasn't expecting for him to say that he would still help to treat her. Her condition wasn't one that could be treated so easily.</p>
 <p>"I wish to help you, but there's really nothing I can do to help. You won't be able to treat my condition. There's no need for you to say this." The lady spoke out politely. She didn't wish to say that there wasn't a need for Qing Shui to put up an act anymore.</p>
 <p>"Let's put this problem aside first. Since I've come, you've got to let me try. Do you really want to give up? You'll have nothing to lose even if you were to let me try." Qing Shui looked at her seriously.</p>
 <p>"You really want to try? Alright, then let's give it a try!" The lady didn't hold any hope for it. It had already been three years. With the Diwu Clan's abilities, they looked for many alchemists and physicians. However, there was only one conclusion, that it couldn't be treated. If this guy were to say that the effects would only be known after a series of treatment, she would feel disgusted by it.</p>
 <p>The Diwu Clan even brought out a Life Regeneration Pill for her, something which could regenerate a person's body, and had been treasured by the clan for very long. However, it was unknown if it was because she had both her legs or any other reason that she could walk. Her meridian channels indeed had gotten a little better, but yet, they weren't able to recover completely. Her body's deterioration had gotten better. However, due to the fact that the meridian channels of both of her legs were completely destroyed, her body's deterioration started again one year later.</p>
 <p>This caused the Diwu Clan and this lady to both feel that the Life Regeneration Pill was fake.</p>
 <p>Just like that, the time that followed were all desperate replies. The clan didn't keep it from her. In fact, they wouldn't be able to keep it hidden from her. When time passed, she got used to it as well. Although her body was deteriorating, she could still hang on for another eight to ten years.</p>
 <p>However, such days were not good. Living was a torture, but yet she couldn't bear to die. She was still young and didn't wish to die either. But this was how life was, beyond one's control.</p>
 <p>"Is there a bathtub here?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>"Yes!"</p>
 <p>Very soon, a bathtub that was half the height of a person was brought out. Qing Shui took out a drop of the Spring of Life and let the lady drink it. This was something which could be used to sustain one's life.</p>
 <p>Next, the bath was supported up and a burning fire was kept under it. During this process, the lady was actually very astonished. It was because the drop from the Spring of Life earlier seemed gave her a hint of hope.</p>
 <p>She had already guessed that it was the Spring of Life, but she didn't ask. When the water in the tub boiled, Qing Shui threw in some medicinal herbs. Many of them were extremely precious ones.</p>
 <p>For her condition, it was useless to use medicine to prolong one's life. He would need to clear all the meridian channels in her body and let the destroyed ones work again, thereby reviving the vitality in her body.</p>
 <p>A large degree of the deterioration in her body was caused by herself. A person who was dejected and had lost all hopes would sometimes start to find the vitality in their body starting to deteriorate. It might also happen when one had to face great obstacles and pressure in life. One could age quickly when put under such circumstances for a prolonged period of time.</p>
 <p>The drop in her cultivation, the clan's hopes... She carried great pressure which had contributed to her condition. Other than being able to change her body's condition, that drop of the Spring of Life from earlier could also awaken some of the vitality in her body.</p>
 <p>"Miss Diwu, you can jump in now." Qing Shui said when he saw that the water had completely boiled over and the medicinal powers from the herbs had already seeped into the water.</p>
 <p>"Just like that?" The lady asked softly.</p>
 <p>"It's fine just like that. The effect would be even better if you're wearing less clothes." Qing Shui was saying the truth. However, he felt that he would seem to be taking advantage if he were to say it now.</p>
 <p>"You're a good physician."</p>
 <p>The lady said softly and then took off her outer clothes, leaving a thin layer of silk clothings on her. Her black undergarments could be faintly seen and her snow white skin was also indistinctly shown. Her well-embodied curves had great seduction to them.</p>
 <p>"Is the view nice?" The lady saw that Qing Shui had been keeping his eyes on her.</p>
 <p>"Not bad!" Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>The reason the lady asked this was because she didn't feel uncomfortable from Qing Shui's gaze. When men secretly looked at women, it made them appear vulgar. However, if they were to calmly and boldly watch and even gave some compliments openly, it would be another situation altogether. At the very least, it would be better than sneaking looks. Women didn't like cowardly men.</p>
 <p>The lady floated up and landed into the tub. The water reached all the way to her collarbone and the steam quickly wet her hair.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then poured another three drops of Spring of Life into the tub. The Spring of Life was very precious, but he was able to get one drop in less than a day from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Of course, the one day count was of the outside world.</p>
 <p>The process went on for about six hours and the water continued to boil until all the water had evaporated. Only a cultivator could be put through this. Ordinary people would have been cooked over.</p>
 <p>After all the water had dried up, Qing Shui quickly let her lay down on the bed. He then took out the gold needles and started to treat the damaged meridian channels on the lady's legs, as he applied the five element acupuncture to stimulate her vitality through the five elements.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, doing all of these weren't difficult. However, it wouldn't be the same for someone else. It was because they didn't have the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and the Force of Rebirth 再生之力like him. These were the reasons why Qing Shui's acupuncture was so amazing.</p>
 <p>Stimulating potential, strengthening foundations, Nine Yang Gold Needle!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could sense that the vitality in the lady's body was rapidly recovering. She felt that her legs were gaining strength, and the flow of her blood and origin Qi also resumed.</p>
 <p>It was then when she finally believed that this young man could treat her. Looking at the extremely thin gold needles that covered all over her legs, she could not help but assessed this guy once through.</p>
 <p>He was very young and handsome. This was a demonic young man. To think that he was able to treat such an incurable disease. She understood her body well and it could be said that she had mostly recovered. In the past, her origin Qi wasn't able to flow but now, she could sense the changes to her body.</p>
 <p>The 81 gold needles pierced into her legs as they spinned and trembled. Qing Shui would occasionally flick these gold needles. Each time a needle was flicked, it would be as if a resonance was created as the other gold needles would move in tandem.</p>
 <p>The process went on until the sun set. Qing Shui kept the gold needles. A dense layer of sweat had appeared on his face and he wiped them off with his sleeves. This energy depletion from this acupuncture process would not lose out to where one could experience in an actual battle.</p>
 <p>"Try to feel it. See if you can circulate your Qi now." Qing Shui kept the gold needles and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"It's fine now. I can sense it. I'm just not sure if I'm still in a dream. This is very similar to a scene from my dreams, but this time around, it feels a little more realistic. I'm afraid that when I wake up, everything will return to how it was before." The lady said calmly.</p>
 <p>"This is real, it isn't a dream."</p>
 <p>"Prove it." The lady looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Prove? How do I do that?" Qing Shui was stunned as well.</p>
 <p>"Give me a kiss." The lady appeared very calm. It might be because she felt that she was in a dream and thus was so bold.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. What was this? It didn't seem appropriate for him to kiss her, but if he didn't... She was clearly overwhelmed from the great surprise and it wasn't good for her to continue to remain in such a daze. It could be considered another form of losing control of her mind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't take any action. However, the lady hugged him and then he felt a soft, moist touch on his lips. Her small tongue reached into his mouth like a little snake. However, she abruptly and quickly pushed Qing Shui away.</p>
 <p>"To think that this is real... Don't think about it too much. Consider it as an additional reward for you..." The lady sounded a little upset.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt gloomy. He had yet been able to show any reaction before the entire thing ended.</p>
 <p>"Additional reward? Then does that mean that there's some other reward?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>"Aren't you looking for Di Chen? I'm now able to help you." Qing Shui looked at the lady and realized that her abilities had unknowingly reached a very high level and was still rapidly increasing, or rather, it was rapidly recovering.</p>
 <p>"Oh? You're able to help me get into contact with her?" Qing Shui was quite surprised as well.</p>
 <p>"Now I can. It's because I can return to the Lotus Sect again. So I can naturally help you contact her. Oh, right, how are the two of you related?" The lady seemed to have only thought of this question now.</p>
 <p>"She's my wife. The reason I've come to the Western Oxhe Continent is to look for her." Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>"Wife? How's that possible? Holy Maidens won't get married." The lady said in surprise.</p>
 <p>"Then she can don't be a Holy Maiden." Qing Shui said casually.</p>
 <p>"You make things sound so easy. Do you think that it's easy to become a Holy Maiden? Moreover, it isn't achievable just because one wish to become one and isn't something that can be renounced so easily." The lady said.</p>
 <p>"I thought they aren't allowed to get married? What would happen if they were to get married?" Qing Shui gave it some thought before he asked.</p>
 <p>"If a Holy Maiden wishes to get married, she must return everything the sect has given to her."</p>
 <p>"What has the sect given to her?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and asked.</p>
 <p>"Cultivation!"</p>
 <p>"You mean that she'll need to cripple her cultivation?"</p>
 <p>"That's right!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, "Forget it, let's not talk about these. We'll see how after I've met her." He gave it some thought and said. Right now, he wasn't scared of the Lotus Sect.</p>
 <p>"That'll be good. Oh right, I'm called Diwu Zhisha."</p>
 <p>"Your name has character. Probably everyone who has heard it would remember it." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Are you saying that my name sounds bad?"</p>
 <p>"There's no name which sounds bad, only people who looks bad." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Then do you think that my name sounds nice?"</p>
 <p>"It does."</p>
 <p>"You're tactful. Alright. You stay in the vicinity and give me some time. I'll return to the Lotus Sect first and then bring her to meet you." Diwu Zhisha said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Would it take very long?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and asked.</p>
 <p>"It won't. There's a unique route to Lotus Sect. It'll be very fast and you won't have to be kept waiting for long. I'll definitely be able to return before the new year."</p>
