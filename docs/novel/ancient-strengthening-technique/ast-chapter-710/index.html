 <p><strong>AST 710 - To meet with unexpected failure? Anger, Kill</strong></p>
 <p>Spirit Slaying Dance!</p>
 <p>This was a murderous dance that was unique to Tu Ling. Under the effects of the Spirit Slaying Dance, even those with resolute natures would gradually die as their heart ruptured.</p>
 <p>At first, Qing Shui had felt that intense attraction, which was like a kind of losing himself. He wanted to follow the dance and to be engrossed in its movements.</p>
 <p>However, he knew that the opponent was using this method to entice him. It was possible that the instant he was engrossed in the dance, she would make a fatal move.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his Nature Energy to resist against the opponents enticement. He felt that this girl was both an angel and a devil, with the air of an angel but the charm of a devil.</p>
 <p>“Was my dance good?” The girl’s gentle lips slightly curved up. Her tone was had become more soothing, to the point it could induce lethargy.</p>
 <p>“It was nice but I did not like it.” Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>Tu Ling’s eyes brightened, as she moved in the sky like leaves falling off a tree. “Why do you think that?”</p>
 <p>“There was an intense killing intent coming from you, and your murderous dance had flaws to it. If you can get rid of your thick desire to murder, then the might of your ‘murderous dance’ may improve by many folds.” Qing Shui smiled gently.</p>
 <p>“Sir understands dances?” Tu Ling looked suspiciously at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I do not understand dances. I only understand the art of killing and could feel your desire to murder. That shows that you were not successful.” Qing Shui looked at this girl that could be classified as a disaster.</p>
 <p>“I came today to discuss something with sir. What do you think?” Tu Ling thought for a while before descending down to the ground.</p>
 <p>“I do not have much time, so speak quickly!” No changes could be observed in Qing Shui but he did not relax the Nature Energy in his body.</p>
 <p>“The Tu Clan and the Hai Clan may have had some disputes in the past but they were nothing major. My father sent me here to talk with you, in hopes that we could make peace with each other and together deal with the Luo Clan. What do you think?” The girl’s expression seemed serious, as she hesitated a little before speaking in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not say anything and only blankly stared at the girl in front of him as he thought about the meaning of her words. He knew that the reason she had hesitated was because she had the desire to kill him and was thinking of ways to do so.</p>
 <p>“If you agree, not only can our two clans make peace, but it would show that I still look good. Here, take a look.” Tu Ling’s body trembled a little, and her wonderful long body exuded a shocking charm at that moment. The spiritual and graceful charm was much higher than it had been when she was dancing.</p>
 <p>She squinted her eyes and exuded a fatal attraction. With her earlier subtle actions, Qing Shui’s mind went blank for an instant.</p>
 <p>Just at that moment, the girl took action, her pretty figure moving incredibly quickly. She held a dark gold foot-long dagger in her hands and stabbed it towards Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui had recovered from his stupor, he discovered that his body was a little stiff. The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and Nature Energy were rapidly helping him to recover but it seemed that he had no way to avoid that extraordinarily sharp dagger.</p>
 <p>Meeting with unexpected failure!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finally understood how it felt to meet with unexpected failure. It was a pity that he was not able to avoid this attack. If he had a little more time, just a little more time, it would be sufficient to save himself.</p>
 <p>However, there was no medicine for regret. He could only watch as the cruel smile of that girl’s face approached. Her pretty smile belied her nature as a true killer.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui resigned himself to fate, a hand blocked the dagger. A figure stood in between Qing Shui and that dagger, helping him to avoid it.</p>
 <p>That dagger pierced that palm and touched his chest, causing Qing Shui to be pushed away.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw that Hai Dongqing had appeared, he knew she had used the Luan's Strength to raise her speed to the peak of Martial Saint. With sufficient speed, she was able to block that attack. As for using her hand to block the attack, it was for insurance so that she could push Qing Shui away if needed….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui supported Hai Dongqing and seeing her bleeding hand, he hurriedly took out the Golden Medicinal Salve and poured it on the wound. Just at this moment, Tu Ling attacked once again, the dagger in her hand gleaming coldly as it struck towards Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
 <p>“Get lost!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not even look before taking a step back. He was extremely angry now. Tu Ling was as pretty as a flower, and yet her heart was so vicious. In his anger, Qing Shui kicked out with all his strength, refusing to let the same thing occur again.</p>
 <p>Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the kick would definitely hit because Qing Shui had given up defending and only used ‘Minute Subtlety’ to avoid the dagger. As a result, there was a small wound on his neck but the arteries were not cut.</p>
 <p>The full strength of his kick was not something that Tu Ling could endure. Even though he did not use the Big Dipper Sword, Violet Gold Divine Shield, or Heavenly Talismans to increase his abilities, his kick still blasted apart this beautiful girl.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was truly angry. He knew he had almost died because he was careless, but he was still angry. Qing Shui did not feel any remorse over killing such a beautiful yet deadly girl at all.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing watched as Qing Shui tended to her wound. She felt pain in her hand but not in her heart. Her heart felt warm as she remembered Qing Shui’s anger when that girl interrupted him while he tended to her wounds.</p>
 <p>“Does it hurt?” Qing Shui held Hai Dongqing’s hand and asked in concern.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t, not even a little bit!” Hai Dongqing gently smiled. She felt happy to being able to do something for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The death of the girl from the Tu Clan would trigger the start of the battle between the Tu Clan and the Hai Clan. Tu Ling was one of the Tu Clan’s trump cards, but Qing Shui didn’t know why she had appeared so early.</p>
 <p>Those who knew Tu Ling feared her like one would fear snakes and scorpions. Those who did not know her true nature would want to take advantage of her. The number of people who had died by her hands was too many, but it could not compare to the number of men who had died to her beauty.</p>
 <p>“Dongqing, go to the side and wait for me.” Qing Shui told Hai Dongqing to wait for him with the Hai Clan.</p>
 <p>“You must be careful!” Hai Dongqing muttered this sentence before going over to the Hai Clan members. It would not suitable for her to participate in this kind of battle situation. Although she wasn’t severely injured, she would not be able to hold a sword for three to five days.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui slowly walked towards the Tu Clan members, the middle-aged man from earlier shouted: “Kill him, everyone attack together!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had shocked many by killing a lot of people earlier. As a result, there were some people among the Tu Clan who did not want to rush forward but were pushed by the people behind.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>When the opponents entered his attack range, Qing Shui just directly used a Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The strength of 7500 countries exploded out, instantly killing most of the people in front. Although Qing Shui had not used the Mighty Elephant Stomp against enemies for a long time, its power had increased significantly now that the abilities of his body had been raised.</p>
 <p>If he could train the Mighty Elephant Stomp to the Great Perfection Stage, its might would be even greater.</p>
 <p>There were a few fortunate old man with strong abilities who evaded. That tall and sturdy middle-aged man managed to move out of the way as well. However, they all turned pale, and one of the old men was even vomiting out blood. Although he evaded the attack, the shockwaves still injured him.</p>
 <p>They were shocked by Qing Shui’s strength. The middle-aged man had only seen this level of strength from his father. It was said that the abilities of the Luo Clan’s head were the most horrifying but the youth in front of him seemed even more horrifying.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui eyebrows twitched, and he quickly threw out the Frosted Iron Ball!</p>
 <p>Almost at the same time, an anxious voice was heard: “Jie`er, quickly retreat!”</p>
 <p>“Too late!” Qing Shui’s voice resounded in reply.</p>
 <p>The members of the Tu Clan from earlier were all completely destroyed. This was very normal, as these people who had died were not the experts of the Tu Clan. Furthermore, with Qing Shui’s improvements, these people weren’t even worth mentioning.</p>
 <p>A tall and sturdy old man with white hair and long white eyebrows led a few dozen people and walked over. It was a pity that he was too late, and the remaining people from the Tu Clan had all killed by Qing Shui’s hidden weapons.</p>
 <p>“Tu Renxiong, how does it feel to see your son die? You were so determined in dominating Cold Ice City alone. I wonder which is more important to you, your son’s life or dominating Cold Ice City?” Hai Tian smiled at the tall and sturdy old man across from him.</p>
 <p>“You coarse old fellow, you managed to escaped last night. I will slaughter your entire clan today.” The old man stared fiercely at Hai Tian as he gritted his teeth and fumed with rage.</p>
 <p>The Hai Clan and the Tu Clan had a feud against each other, because the Tu Clan had wanted to replace the position of the Hai Clan. The Hai Clan knew of this intention so when the two clans met, they would naturally mock each other and make sarcastic remarks.</p>
 <p>This time Qing Shui frowned, but he felt the situation was still under control. He could feel the old man had the strength of 9000 countries, the three people behind him had his own strength of about 8000 countries and the remaining ones were only at the abilities of 6000 countries.</p>
 <p>This was the foundation of the Tu Clan. This amount of strength was still within Qing Shui’s expectations but he was still a little surprised. The strength of the clans in Cold Ice City seemed stronger than usual.</p>
 <p>If he had not broken through, he would have a hard time against these true experts of the Tu Clan. Even if he had used all his Demonic Beasts, he wouldn’t have been certain about the results.</p>
 <p>However Qing Shui did not feel pressured now after he had raised his abilities to their peaks. When he used the Seven Star Armored Vest and Godly Armor Shield, his defense exceeded 10000 countries. Although his attack was still somewhat weaker than that of the old man, Qing Shui had techniques that could weaken the latter until he would collapse from his first blow.</p>
 <p>This was a kind of superiority.</p>
 <p>Experience brought by suffering teaches wisdom. To a certain degree, everyone knew they had to be careful to guard against unexpected failure. Even so, there would be times where he would be unable to do anything.</p>
 <p>Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and mounted it. By working with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he would have more that enough strength to deal with the people in front of him.</p>
 <p>“The Hai Clan is truly lacking in people. They still need an outsider to fight alone for them. I really pity you guys.” The tall and sturdy old man shouted loudly at Hai Tian, as though he wanted all of Cold Ice City to hear.</p>
 <p>“What are you shouting for? You can say whatever you want, but there is no glory for you. You are living under the thumbs of the Luo Clan and yet you are so happy about it. Is being the dog of someone else something to be proud of? I am not afraid of your master, not to mention you mongrel.” Hai Tian said seemingly without a care.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Qing Shui saw cultivators with this level of strength scolding each other with vicious and infuriating words. If one didn’t have a good attitude, it might actually be possible for him to vomit blood from hearing such insults and diatribes.</p>
