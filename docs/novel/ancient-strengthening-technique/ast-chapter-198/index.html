  <p><strong>AST 198 – A word, Love. Wondrous Fruit</strong></p>
  <p>Now, Qing Shui really wanted to find out if there was a 4th level to the Violet Jade Immortal Realm.</p>
  <p>Zhu Qing had a extremely satisfied expression on her face as she lazily laid across Qing Shui’s chest. Her soft and towering twin peaks pressed against Qing Shui’s, causing his weapon that was still in her to remain powerfully erect. Momentarily, he would thrust a bit, causing small moans to escape from Zhu Qing.</p>
  <p>After that bout of passion, Zhu Qing’s countenance was as red as the sunset and extremely attractive to look at. Her big, beautiful eyes gave off the essence of silk as her connected body with Qing Shui laid together on the brand new bedding.</p>
  <p>“3rd Martial Aunt, are you satisfied already?” Qing Shui adjusted the pillow as he casually spoke. He hated the fact that Zhu Qing used the Overwhelming Fragrance. Despite so, he still rolled about in the bed with her for half a day.</p>
  <p>“Are you hating me for the fact that I used the Overwhelming Fragrance?</p>
  <p>“No, what I hate is you.” After which, Qing Shui got dressed.</p>
  <p>Zhu Qing was speechless; Qing Shui’s attitude changed at the speed of a page flip of a book. Earlier, he was still teasing her, but he turned into a stranger in an instant. Although she didn’t intend to spend all eternity with him, she couldn’t help but feel a wave of disappointment from the way Qing Shui acted.</p>
  <p>Zhu Qing gazed at Qing Shui, who was wearing his clothes, with a dejected look in her eyes. Perhaps… she had erred?</p>
  <p>Laughing bitterly before picking up her clothes, she shockingly realised that after doing the deed with Qing Shui, the degree of her passion towards women had lessened by a great deal. That was why she was so hurt by Qing Shui’s coldness.</p>
  <p>After he wore his clothes, Qing Shui gazed at the somewhat fragile-looking Zhu Qing. He knew that this woman was several times stronger when compared to Yiye Jiange, and even he might not be her match. However, no matter how powerful a woman was, she was still a woman! </p>
  <p>“No matter what your intentions are, we shall be strangers after this.” After speaking, Qing Shui turned and left the cave.</p>
  <p>Zhu Qing silently stood there, feeling extremely fidgety. She had never hoped for anything, but only wished that she could start anew. She didn’t know that Qing Shui hated women that lied to him the most as well as manipulative b*tches.</p>
  <p>Although many guys would like the method Zhu Qing used this time around, Qing Shui felt extremely disgusted by it.</p>
  <p>As Qing Shui left, he actually felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart. He wasn’t someone that was emotionless. How many people in this world could actually be so heartless, especially after doing this sort of thing with a girl? If not, Qing Shui wouldn’t be so determined to get married with Shi Qingzhuang. If it were not because both of them had intimate contact, he wouldn’t have had the intention of breaking Situ Bufan’s engagement apart.</p>
  <p>As for Zhu Qing, Qing Shui felt very conflicted. From the start, he had never wanted to f*ck this woman. Although she was very beautiful and matured enough to move his heart, Qing Shui had already lost all thoughts of banging her the moment he knew of her preferences. He wasn’t again lesbianism, but it was just that the girls in his harem couldn’t love other girls.</p>
  <p>What would happen if Zhu Qing ate up all the girls in his harem? If he became a ‘victim’? At that moment, it would be too late to regret his decision.</p>
  <p>Thus, after the deed, Qing Shui decided to draw a clear boundary line with her. Although he felt somewhat heartless, he still did it and departed.</p>
  <p>In fact, when Qing Shui forced those words out, he felt a sense of despair in his heart. Qing Shui felt extremely disgusted with his own state of heart.</p>
  <p>After walking into a remote region, he instantly entered into his spatial realm. He wondered if the spatial realm would be able to level up. But as Qing Shui entered…</p>
  <p>The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal didn’t even have the slightest change at all. It was totally the same as before. Qing Shui was very depressed; he had such high hopes that there would be an upgrade…</p>
  <p>“Perhaps my previous horny thinking was wrong?”</p>
  <p>“Then why did the spatial realm successfully undergo an upgrade the past two times? Could it be that as the level rises, I need to do the deed with more women?” QIng Shui frowned as he discarded this terrifying train of thought.</p>
  <p>Since his spatial realm did not upgrade to the 4th level, Qing Shui exited it with a heavy heart. Initially, he thought that he had already found the secret, but to think that it was all for nothing. </p>
  <p>“Sigh, let’s just leave it to nature. This can’t be forced.”</p>
  <p>After recalling the fragile expression of Zhu Qing, he almost involuntarily wanted to comfort her. After all, the instance after sex was the time span where women would usually be the most emotionally vulnerable.</p>
  <p>After that incident, Qing Shui had never taken a step out of Cloud Mist Peak. He was cultivating the Bear Form, Tiger Form, and Deer Cantering technique almost every day. So far, he had already deciphered the essence of the Bear Form and recorded that down. After which, he would pass the cultivation methods for the Bear and Tiger Form to Yiye Jiange. After all, these techniques were all supplementary techniques and were extremely difficult to cultivate in.</p>
  <p>In the blink of an eye, over ten days passed. The disciples of the Skysword Sect who departed the mountains all returned. However, Cloud Mist Peak was still cloaked in solitude as before. Qing Shui spent all his days playing with the little lass and strictly guiding her on cultivation.</p>
  <p>Within these ten days, Qing Shui didn’t manage to cultivate the Bear Form to the small success stage, but he had already somewhat understood the crux of that level.</p>
  <p>Today, Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui, and little lass went for a stroll together. When suddenly, Yiye Jiange spoke and caused Qing Shui to be stunned.</p>
  <p>“3rd Senior Sister went crazy, and it’s very serious!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui bewilderedly glanced at Yiye Jiange, and his heartbeat quickened. Could it be that this had something to do with him? Did Yiye know about what had happened? That shouldn’t be the case because based on the personality of Zhu Qing, this matter wouldn’t be publicised by her.</p>
  <p>“I know you are strong in the medical arts. She had already lost so much weight in these mere ten days, and looks extremely weary. Can you visit her to see if there’s any way you can help?” Yiye slowly spoke as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui heaved a sigh of relief. He wasn’t really afraid that this matter would be known by others. It was just that he didn’t want to find trouble for himself!</p>
  <p>However, a Xiantian Cultivator normally should be impervious to illness of all kinds. Unless, their injuries were in the vital organs, such as damage to the Dantian, etc.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui already somewhat knew what Zhu Qing was suffering from. It was matter of the heart. However, was he the cause of it? In any case, since his goddess master had already asked him for his help, he could only furrow his brows and go take a look.</p>
  <p>“Let us go now then. We will fly to Zhu Qing Peak.” Yiye remarked.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go!” Qing Shui helplessly replied.</p>
  <p>“What’s going on? Do you have some misunderstanding with my 3rd Senior Sister?” Yiye noticed Qing Shui’s unwillingness as she suspiciously inquired.</p>
  <p>“How could there be? Let’s go.” Qing Shui forced his countenance to relax as he mounted on the Icesnow Immortal Crane with Yiye.</p>
  <p>Soon after, the Immortal Crane had already arrived in the airspace above Zhu Qing Peak. Zhu Qing Peak looked about the same as Misty Peak. The only difference was that it was more lively here, unlike the quiet solitude of Misty Peak.</p>
  <p>After the Immortal Crane landed, Qing Shui noticed many female disciples staring at him in wonderment. There were in awe, fascination, and even had mesmerized looks in their eyes.</p>
  <p>“Wah, it’s Martial Aunt Yiye and Elder Qing Shui!” A female disciple called out hysterically.</p>
  <p>“Elder Qing Shui is so young! He actually became an Elder at such a young age!”</p>
  <p>“The two of them look so cute together!” Another female disciple sighed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange had weird expressions on their countenance as Yiye glanced at him with hidden bitterness. Qing Shui felt extremely wrong, but he didn’t really understand the portent of Yiye’s gaze.</p>
  <p>They entered a grand hall, and walked through it by exiting to a little courtyard in the back. There was also a small building situated at the back.</p>
  <p>Standing at the door, there were two females. Upon seeing Yiye Jiange and Qing Shui, they dipped into a bow. Yiye and Qing Shui continued without halting their steps as they entered into the room.</p>
  <p>After entering, Qing Shui felt that the space within was actually quite spacious. He was inside a huge living room, and he continued to move towards the room located on the west side.</p>
  <p>“Senior Sister, eat something. If you don’t, your body wouldn’t be able to take it.” A male was trying to persuade Zhu Qing.</p>
  <p>The moment Qing Shui heard the voice, he knew that it originated from the Elder that was slightly older than Yiye, the 9th Elder.</p>
  <p>“Little Kun, ignore me. I’m fine… I just have no appetite.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, after hearing the sound of that hoarse voice, was shocked. He could determine that the voice belonged to Zhu Qing. Why had it changed so much? Initially, her voice was melodious, filled with charm, and had an extremely smooth feel to it.</p>
  <p>After entering the room, Qing Shui saw in disbelief as he witnessed the weary and fragile Zhu Qing on the bed. There was actually such an immense change in the course of over ten days.</p>
  <p>The jade-white face of hers had become a deathly pale-white at this moment. Even her beautiful eyes seemed somewhat blurred and her whole body reduced to a bag of skinny bones.</p>
  <p>The man had a bowl of hot lotus porridge and wanted to feed Zhu Qing. However, she shook her head and refused to eat.</p>
  <p>Just as the male wanted to persuade Zhu Qing again, that bowl of piping hot porridge had already disappeared as it reappeared in the hands of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui sat down slowly on the bedside of Zhu Qing, “Martial Aunt, it breaks my heart to see you losing so much weight. Could you eat a little for me?”</p>
  <p>Zhu Qing froze for a second before she saw the smiling Qing Shui sitting by her bed, attempting to feed her porridge. In a state of disbelief, she blinked her eyes as a look of wonder flashed within.</p>
  <p>Under the dumbfounded gazes of Little Kun and Yiye Jiange, Zhu Qing finished that bowl of porridge.</p>
  <p>Two of the four people in that room were stunned, exceptionally stunned. What just happened? Why did Zhu Qing, who had always been stubbornly refusing to eat, suddenly finish the porridge when it was offered by Qing Shui? </p>
  <p>Yiye slowly called out lightly as she walked out the room with her ninth Martial Senior Brother closing the door behind them.</p>
  <p>“Why are you doing this to yourself? Do you not want to live anymore?” Qing Shui placed down the bowl and looked at the woman that he could not imagine was the same person as the well-embodied lady he saw a few days ago.</p>
  <p>“I don’t know. I feel like I don’t have any ounce of strength within me. I don’t feel like moving or doing anything. The words you said kept repeating in my mind and I felt very bad. I had never wanted for you to be with me, and had even tried to avoid you since that day. However, the words you said before you left made me feel as if my world had turned grey.”</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui listened to Zhu Qing’s coarse voice and saw that a layer of pink had reappeared on her sickly face. He felt confused and helpless not knowing whether to be happy or depressed.</p>
  <p>“Thank you for visiting me today. I’m really happy.”</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui heard that, he lifted her up together with the blanket. She was very light, and even with the blanket, she was still lighter than she was that day. “Get well. You must get well. Actually, I have also been thinking about you. I was purposely trying to anger you the other day.”</p>
  <p>“I know, I will not expect anything else from you. I know that you knew about my relationship with women and that you detest me. I’m satisfied that you came to see me today.”</p>
  <p>The smiling Zhu Qing seemed so pitiful yet beautiful at the same time. She lightly hung her arms around Qing Shui’s neck and planted a kiss on his face.</p>
  <p>“I don’t detest you; no one can detest you. You have entered my heart. Ever since that day, your figure has appeared in my heart but I forced myself not to think of you. If I knew that you would be so sick, I would have came earlier.” Qing Shui could not get past himself. He would never be able to learn how to give up on a woman whom he liked and who loved him!</p>
  <p>“I’ll nurse you. In the future, you are not allowed to vent it out on your own body.” Qing Shui whacked with a bit of strength on the seemingly fleshy butt.</p>
  <p>Zhu Qing gave out a coquettish cry in objection. Her frail look would still make one feel protective of her.</p>
  <p>After applying acupuncture to strengthen her foundation and develop energy and her potential, Qing Shui regenerated her energy very quickly. This was also thanks to the fact that the burden in her heart had been lifted. After all, the cause itself could be the cure to the problems of the heart.</p>
  <p>“Remember my words. In the future, treat yourself better. Another thing, don’t do it with women in the future. If you can’t settle it and if you feel like it, you can look for me…”</p>
  <p>Zhu Qing turned flushed red and covered Qing Shui’s mouth, rolling her eyes. In the skinny state she was in, her feminine charms were even stronger than before. “You’re not allowed to say it. I will not be with women in the future.”</p>
  <p>“I’ll be going now. I’ll come visit you in a few days. To think that despite being an adult, you’re still like a kid and cannot take care of yourself.” Qing Shui kept the Gold Needles and teased.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui…”</p>
  <p>“Hmm, what is it?” Qing Shui could not understand why Zhu Qing felt hesitant.</p>
  <p>“Give me a hug!” She lowered her head and said in a soft voice.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and lifted her chin, looking at the extremely feminine person. His hands went under her arm and he hugged her closely and tightly as if trying to glue their hearts together.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, thank you!” Zhu Qing wrapped her arms tightly around Qing Shui’s neck and said passionately.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange left the room while Zhu Qing looked at them until they went up the Snow White Crane. While in the air, Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui in surprised, not blinking. Her eyes which transcended the common world seemed as if they were able to see through him.</p>
  <p>“Ask what you wish to, don’t look at me like that. Master, it’s not as if you don’t know how much damage you could cause with your beauty that could cause the fall of countries and cities.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly and said.</p>
  <p>“You’re on good terms with my Martial Sister?” Yiye Jiange restrained herself for a very long time before she asked this question which made Qing Shui unsure if he should laugh or cry.</p>
  <p>“Mmm.”</p>
  <p>“You like my Martial Sister?” After a while, Yiye Jiange asked again.</p>
  <p>“Master, are you thinking of asking me if I have that sort of relationship with her?” Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange turned silent!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled, but kept quiet as well. He did not wish to say while Yiye Jiange blamed herself on why she was so out of it today. What had their relationship got to do with her?</p>
  <p>Back in Cloud Mist Peak, Qing Shui once again returned to his world where he did not care about anything except for his training. Sometimes, he would bring the lass as they would walk around in the wilderness of the Skysword Mountain. Of course, they were on the White Feathered Condor. Occasionally, Qing Shui would get the lass to practise her Deer Cantering.</p>
  <p>In the wilderness, Qing Shui wondered if they could come across some strange or unique fruits, but none appeared. However, he was not disappointed. Today, he brought the lass to the back of Skysword Mountain where the scenery was like a bottomless pit and extremely dangerous. They flew below the peak and near the part of Skysword Mountain’s skewed arch which was like that of a sword’s.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, look over there!” Luan Luan looked straight at a particular spot and shouted.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui followed Luan Luan’s gaze and discovered that on the walls of the cliff in the mountain range a few distance away, there was spot that was dark and where light did not shine in. At the very top, there hung a huge, pretty red fruit that looked like a coconut and had the size of a child’s head.</p>
  <p>“Wondrous Fruit!”</p>
  <p>This was what Qing Shui thought. It was exactly the same as the item that came to his mind.</p>
  <p>“Luan Luan, can you get Little White to get closer to that spot?” Qing Shui asked the lass. The lass’s vision and senses were extraordinary.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was very agitated. This was good stuff, absolutely good stuff. It was just that he was not sure what effects it had in the world of the nine continents. He wanted to pluck it off and even transplant the vines.</p>
  <p>The White Feathered Condor stopped there steadily. At the sight of that bright color and the fragrant scent, Qing Shui knew it had already long riped, but it had just been hanging here all along.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui straightaway plucked off the “Wondrous Fruit” and passed it to Luan Luan!</p>
  <p>“Don’t eat it. We’ll go back and ask your mom if this is edible. It might be a bad fruit.” Qing Shui passed to Luan Luan and said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui crushed the stones on the cliff walls, and slowly and carefully removed the roots. He was afraid that if he were to damage the root system, the vine would not be able to survive!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui played a round of hide and seek with the lass and transplanted the vine in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>Thereafter, Qing Shui fiddled about this “Wondrous Fruit” which searching the vicinity. Qing Shui was puzzled on why there were no demonic beasts guarding the fruit. If there weren’t any, the fruit would have been plucked off long ago. Could it be because the “Wondrous Fruit” was not of a high quality?</p>
  <p>After making a round, he did not discover anything else. The bored lass had fallen asleep in his arms. Since it was late, he let the groggy lass tell the White Feathered Condor to head back to Cloud Mist Peak.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the Wondrous Fruit that was emitting a faint red light, feeling that it shouldn’t just be considered bad. In these past days, he had spent his time exploring the dangerous spots in the area, but he had not manage to find anything good. While he did find a few items that he thought were good, it was after he had checked with Yiye Jiange that he was laughed at and told that they were rubbish. </p>
  <p>When they returned to Cloud Mist peak, Yiye Jiange was in front of the hall, as if waiting for him and the lass! He felt very happy, and oddly overjoyed.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange stepped up to carry the lass in Qing Shui’s arms. The slender hands make his heart pound when it touched his chest.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange said softly to Qing Shui, “You’re back!”</p>
  <p>When she saw the Wondrous Fruit in Qing Shui’s hands, she said in astonishment, “Wondrous Fruit!”</p>
  <p>“Hmmm, you know about this?” Qing Shui asked happily, feeling overjoyed. So it was still called the Wondrous Fruit. Seeing Yiye Jiange’s stunned face, it must be something good.</p>
  <p>“The Wondrous Fruit is one of the most amazing fruits in the land of the nine continents and it is extremely precious.” Yiye Jiange touched the Wondrous Fruit happily and said.</p>
  <p>“What effects does it have? How precious is it?”</p>
  <p>“The fruit is best given to children below 12 years old to increase their potential. Each child can only take one to increase 10% of their overall potential. During the process of cultivation in the future, the speed of the child’s progress would increase by another 10%.” Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Are there any side effects?” Qing Shui asked. The Wondrous Fruit that he previously knew of had come with side effects.</p>
  <p>“No. Did you hear that it has?” Yiye Jiange asked, feeling strange.</p>
  <p>“Let Luan Luan have it. The lass had discovered it with her sharp eyes.” Qing Shui passed it to Yiye Jiange who was carrying the lass.</p>
  <p>“Actually, this can increase the lass’s lifespan by three years. 10% of her potential would be equivalent to 10% of her lifespan. The Wondrous Fruit is amazing in that it could increase every ability of the person who took it. For children below twelve years old, it would increase the progress of their cultivation by 10% in the future.” Yiye Jiange slowly explained.</p>
  <p>“Only children below twelve years old can enjoy that 10% increase in their cultivation speed?”</p>
  <p>“Mmm, but when a Xiantian eats it, it can increase all of his abilities at once by 10% and their lifespan by fifty years.” Yiye Jiange held onto the Wondrous Fruit and said as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“So what if we get fifty more years to our lives. Even if it can only increase the lass’s lifespan by three days, we must still give it to her. Each additional day brings more hope.” Qing Shui sighed and said seriously.</p>

 <p><strong>AST 198 – A word, Love. Wondrous Fruit</strong></p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui really wanted to find out if there was a 4th level to the Violet Jade Immortal Realm.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing had a extremely satisfied expression on her face as she lazily laid across Qing Shui’s chest. Her soft and towering twin peaks pressed against Qing Shui’s, causing his weapon that was still in her to remain powerfully erect. Momentarily, he would thrust a bit, causing small moans to escape from Zhu Qing.</p>
 <p>After that bout of passion, Zhu Qing’s countenance was as red as the sunset and extremely attractive to look at. Her big, beautiful eyes gave off the essence of silk as her connected body with Qing Shui laid together on the brand new bedding.</p>
 <p>“3rd Martial Aunt, are you satisfied already?” Qing Shui adjusted the pillow as he casually spoke. He hated the fact that Zhu Qing used the Overwhelming Fragrance. Despite so, he still rolled about in the bed with her for half a day.</p>
 <p>“Are you hating me for the fact that I used the Overwhelming Fragrance?</p>
 <p>“No, what I hate is you.” After which, Qing Shui got dressed.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing was speechless; Qing Shui’s attitude changed at the speed of a page flip of a book. Earlier, he was still teasing her, but he turned into a stranger in an instant. Although she didn’t intend to spend all eternity with him, she couldn’t help but feel a wave of disappointment from the way Qing Shui acted.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing gazed at Qing Shui, who was wearing his clothes, with a dejected look in her eyes. Perhaps… she had erred?</p>
 <p>Laughing bitterly before picking up her clothes, she shockingly realised that after doing the deed with Qing Shui, the degree of her passion towards women had lessened by a great deal. That was why she was so hurt by Qing Shui’s coldness.</p>
 <p>After he wore his clothes, Qing Shui gazed at the somewhat fragile-looking Zhu Qing. He knew that this woman was several times stronger when compared to Yiye Jiange, and even he might not be her match. However, no matter how powerful a woman was, she was still a woman! </p>
 <p>“No matter what your intentions are, we shall be strangers after this.” After speaking, Qing Shui turned and left the cave.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing silently stood there, feeling extremely fidgety. She had never hoped for anything, but only wished that she could start anew. She didn’t know that Qing Shui hated women that lied to him the most as well as manipulative b*tches.</p>
 <p>Although many guys would like the method Zhu Qing used this time around, Qing Shui felt extremely disgusted by it.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui left, he actually felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart. He wasn’t someone that was emotionless. How many people in this world could actually be so heartless, especially after doing this sort of thing with a girl? If not, Qing Shui wouldn’t be so determined to get married with Shi Qingzhuang. If it were not because both of them had intimate contact, he wouldn’t have had the intention of breaking Situ Bufan’s engagement apart.</p>
 <p>As for Zhu Qing, Qing Shui felt very conflicted. From the start, he had never wanted to f*ck this woman. Although she was very beautiful and matured enough to move his heart, Qing Shui had already lost all thoughts of banging her the moment he knew of her preferences. He wasn’t again lesbianism, but it was just that the girls in his harem couldn’t love other girls.</p>
 <p>What would happen if Zhu Qing ate up all the girls in his harem? If he became a ‘victim’? At that moment, it would be too late to regret his decision.</p>
 <p>Thus, after the deed, Qing Shui decided to draw a clear boundary line with her. Although he felt somewhat heartless, he still did it and departed.</p>
 <p>In fact, when Qing Shui forced those words out, he felt a sense of despair in his heart. Qing Shui felt extremely disgusted with his own state of heart.</p>
 <p>After walking into a remote region, he instantly entered into his spatial realm. He wondered if the spatial realm would be able to level up. But as Qing Shui entered…</p>
 <p>The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal didn’t even have the slightest change at all. It was totally the same as before. Qing Shui was very depressed; he had such high hopes that there would be an upgrade…</p>
 <p>“Perhaps my previous horny thinking was wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Then why did the spatial realm successfully undergo an upgrade the past two times? Could it be that as the level rises, I need to do the deed with more women?” QIng Shui frowned as he discarded this terrifying train of thought.</p>
 <p>Since his spatial realm did not upgrade to the 4th level, Qing Shui exited it with a heavy heart. Initially, he thought that he had already found the secret, but to think that it was all for nothing. </p>
 <p>“Sigh, let’s just leave it to nature. This can’t be forced.”</p>
 <p>After recalling the fragile expression of Zhu Qing, he almost involuntarily wanted to comfort her. After all, the instance after sex was the time span where women would usually be the most emotionally vulnerable.</p>
 <p>After that incident, Qing Shui had never taken a step out of Cloud Mist Peak. He was cultivating the Bear Form, Tiger Form, and Deer Cantering technique almost every day. So far, he had already deciphered the essence of the Bear Form and recorded that down. After which, he would pass the cultivation methods for the Bear and Tiger Form to Yiye Jiange. After all, these techniques were all supplementary techniques and were extremely difficult to cultivate in.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, over ten days passed. The disciples of the Skysword Sect who departed the mountains all returned. However, Cloud Mist Peak was still cloaked in solitude as before. Qing Shui spent all his days playing with the little lass and strictly guiding her on cultivation.</p>
 <p>Within these ten days, Qing Shui didn’t manage to cultivate the Bear Form to the small success stage, but he had already somewhat understood the crux of that level.</p>
 <p>Today, Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui, and little lass went for a stroll together. When suddenly, Yiye Jiange spoke and caused Qing Shui to be stunned.</p>
 <p>“3rd Senior Sister went crazy, and it’s very serious!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui bewilderedly glanced at Yiye Jiange, and his heartbeat quickened. Could it be that this had something to do with him? Did Yiye know about what had happened? That shouldn’t be the case because based on the personality of Zhu Qing, this matter wouldn’t be publicised by her.</p>
 <p>“I know you are strong in the medical arts. She had already lost so much weight in these mere ten days, and looks extremely weary. Can you visit her to see if there’s any way you can help?” Yiye slowly spoke as she gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heaved a sigh of relief. He wasn’t really afraid that this matter would be known by others. It was just that he didn’t want to find trouble for himself!</p>
 <p>However, a Xiantian Cultivator normally should be impervious to illness of all kinds. Unless, their injuries were in the vital organs, such as damage to the Dantian, etc.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui already somewhat knew what Zhu Qing was suffering from. It was matter of the heart. However, was he the cause of it? In any case, since his goddess master had already asked him for his help, he could only furrow his brows and go take a look.</p>
 <p>“Let us go now then. We will fly to Zhu Qing Peak.” Yiye remarked.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” Qing Shui helplessly replied.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on? Do you have some misunderstanding with my 3rd Senior Sister?” Yiye noticed Qing Shui’s unwillingness as she suspiciously inquired.</p>
 <p>“How could there be? Let’s go.” Qing Shui forced his countenance to relax as he mounted on the Icesnow Immortal Crane with Yiye.</p>
 <p>Soon after, the Immortal Crane had already arrived in the airspace above Zhu Qing Peak. Zhu Qing Peak looked about the same as Misty Peak. The only difference was that it was more lively here, unlike the quiet solitude of Misty Peak.</p>
 <p>After the Immortal Crane landed, Qing Shui noticed many female disciples staring at him in wonderment. There were in awe, fascination, and even had mesmerized looks in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Wah, it’s Martial Aunt Yiye and Elder Qing Shui!” A female disciple called out hysterically.</p>
 <p>“Elder Qing Shui is so young! He actually became an Elder at such a young age!”</p>
 <p>“The two of them look so cute together!” Another female disciple sighed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange had weird expressions on their countenance as Yiye glanced at him with hidden bitterness. Qing Shui felt extremely wrong, but he didn’t really understand the portent of Yiye’s gaze.</p>
 <p>They entered a grand hall, and walked through it by exiting to a little courtyard in the back. There was also a small building situated at the back.</p>
 <p>Standing at the door, there were two females. Upon seeing Yiye Jiange and Qing Shui, they dipped into a bow. Yiye and Qing Shui continued without halting their steps as they entered into the room.</p>
 <p>After entering, Qing Shui felt that the space within was actually quite spacious. He was inside a huge living room, and he continued to move towards the room located on the west side.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, eat something. If you don’t, your body wouldn’t be able to take it.” A male was trying to persuade Zhu Qing.</p>
 <p>The moment Qing Shui heard the voice, he knew that it originated from the Elder that was slightly older than Yiye, the 9th Elder.</p>
 <p>“Little Kun, ignore me. I’m fine… I just have no appetite.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, after hearing the sound of that hoarse voice, was shocked. He could determine that the voice belonged to Zhu Qing. Why had it changed so much? Initially, her voice was melodious, filled with charm, and had an extremely smooth feel to it.</p>
 <p>After entering the room, Qing Shui saw in disbelief as he witnessed the weary and fragile Zhu Qing on the bed. There was actually such an immense change in the course of over ten days.</p>
 <p>The jade-white face of hers had become a deathly pale-white at this moment. Even her beautiful eyes seemed somewhat blurred and her whole body reduced to a bag of skinny bones.</p>
 <p>The man had a bowl of hot lotus porridge and wanted to feed Zhu Qing. However, she shook her head and refused to eat.</p>
 <p>Just as the male wanted to persuade Zhu Qing again, that bowl of piping hot porridge had already disappeared as it reappeared in the hands of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat down slowly on the bedside of Zhu Qing, “Martial Aunt, it breaks my heart to see you losing so much weight. Could you eat a little for me?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing froze for a second before she saw the smiling Qing Shui sitting by her bed, attempting to feed her porridge. In a state of disbelief, she blinked her eyes as a look of wonder flashed within.</p>
 <p>Under the dumbfounded gazes of Little Kun and Yiye Jiange, Zhu Qing finished that bowl of porridge.</p>
 <p>Two of the four people in that room were stunned, exceptionally stunned. What just happened? Why did Zhu Qing, who had always been stubbornly refusing to eat, suddenly finish the porridge when it was offered by Qing Shui? </p>
 <p>Yiye slowly called out lightly as she walked out the room with her ninth Martial Senior Brother closing the door behind them.</p>
 <p>“Why are you doing this to yourself? Do you not want to live anymore?” Qing Shui placed down the bowl and looked at the woman that he could not imagine was the same person as the well-embodied lady he saw a few days ago.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. I feel like I don’t have any ounce of strength within me. I don’t feel like moving or doing anything. The words you said kept repeating in my mind and I felt very bad. I had never wanted for you to be with me, and had even tried to avoid you since that day. However, the words you said before you left made me feel as if my world had turned grey.”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui listened to Zhu Qing’s coarse voice and saw that a layer of pink had reappeared on her sickly face. He felt confused and helpless not knowing whether to be happy or depressed.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for visiting me today. I’m really happy.”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui heard that, he lifted her up together with the blanket. She was very light, and even with the blanket, she was still lighter than she was that day. “Get well. You must get well. Actually, I have also been thinking about you. I was purposely trying to anger you the other day.”</p>
 <p>“I know, I will not expect anything else from you. I know that you knew about my relationship with women and that you detest me. I’m satisfied that you came to see me today.”</p>
 <p>The smiling Zhu Qing seemed so pitiful yet beautiful at the same time. She lightly hung her arms around Qing Shui’s neck and planted a kiss on his face.</p>
 <p>“I don’t detest you; no one can detest you. You have entered my heart. Ever since that day, your figure has appeared in my heart but I forced myself not to think of you. If I knew that you would be so sick, I would have came earlier.” Qing Shui could not get past himself. He would never be able to learn how to give up on a woman whom he liked and who loved him!</p>
 <p>“I’ll nurse you. In the future, you are not allowed to vent it out on your own body.” Qing Shui whacked with a bit of strength on the seemingly fleshy butt.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing gave out a coquettish cry in objection. Her frail look would still make one feel protective of her.</p>
 <p>After applying acupuncture to strengthen her foundation and develop energy and her potential, Qing Shui regenerated her energy very quickly. This was also thanks to the fact that the burden in her heart had been lifted. After all, the cause itself could be the cure to the problems of the heart.</p>
 <p>“Remember my words. In the future, treat yourself better. Another thing, don’t do it with women in the future. If you can’t settle it and if you feel like it, you can look for me…”</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing turned flushed red and covered Qing Shui’s mouth, rolling her eyes. In the skinny state she was in, her feminine charms were even stronger than before. “You’re not allowed to say it. I will not be with women in the future.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll be going now. I’ll come visit you in a few days. To think that despite being an adult, you’re still like a kid and cannot take care of yourself.” Qing Shui kept the Gold Needles and teased.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui…”</p>
 <p>“Hmm, what is it?” Qing Shui could not understand why Zhu Qing felt hesitant.</p>
 <p>“Give me a hug!” She lowered her head and said in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and lifted her chin, looking at the extremely feminine person. His hands went under her arm and he hugged her closely and tightly as if trying to glue their hearts together.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, thank you!” Zhu Qing wrapped her arms tightly around Qing Shui’s neck and said passionately.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange left the room while Zhu Qing looked at them until they went up the Snow White Crane. While in the air, Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui in surprised, not blinking. Her eyes which transcended the common world seemed as if they were able to see through him.</p>
 <p>“Ask what you wish to, don’t look at me like that. Master, it’s not as if you don’t know how much damage you could cause with your beauty that could cause the fall of countries and cities.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly and said.</p>
 <p>“You’re on good terms with my Martial Sister?” Yiye Jiange restrained herself for a very long time before she asked this question which made Qing Shui unsure if he should laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>“Mmm.”</p>
 <p>“You like my Martial Sister?” After a while, Yiye Jiange asked again.</p>
 <p>“Master, are you thinking of asking me if I have that sort of relationship with her?” Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange turned silent!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, but kept quiet as well. He did not wish to say while Yiye Jiange blamed herself on why she was so out of it today. What had their relationship got to do with her?</p>
 <p>Back in Cloud Mist Peak, Qing Shui once again returned to his world where he did not care about anything except for his training. Sometimes, he would bring the lass as they would walk around in the wilderness of the Skysword Mountain. Of course, they were on the White Feathered Condor. Occasionally, Qing Shui would get the lass to practise her Deer Cantering.</p>
 <p>In the wilderness, Qing Shui wondered if they could come across some strange or unique fruits, but none appeared. However, he was not disappointed. Today, he brought the lass to the back of Skysword Mountain where the scenery was like a bottomless pit and extremely dangerous. They flew below the peak and near the part of Skysword Mountain’s skewed arch which was like that of a sword’s.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, look over there!” Luan Luan looked straight at a particular spot and shouted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed Luan Luan’s gaze and discovered that on the walls of the cliff in the mountain range a few distance away, there was spot that was dark and where light did not shine in. At the very top, there hung a huge, pretty red fruit that looked like a coconut and had the size of a child’s head.</p>
 <p>“Wondrous Fruit!”</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui thought. It was exactly the same as the item that came to his mind.</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan, can you get Little White to get closer to that spot?” Qing Shui asked the lass. The lass’s vision and senses were extraordinary.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very agitated. This was good stuff, absolutely good stuff. It was just that he was not sure what effects it had in the world of the nine continents. He wanted to pluck it off and even transplant the vines.</p>
 <p>The White Feathered Condor stopped there steadily. At the sight of that bright color and the fragrant scent, Qing Shui knew it had already long riped, but it had just been hanging here all along.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui straightaway plucked off the “Wondrous Fruit” and passed it to Luan Luan!</p>
 <p>“Don’t eat it. We’ll go back and ask your mom if this is edible. It might be a bad fruit.” Qing Shui passed to Luan Luan and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui crushed the stones on the cliff walls, and slowly and carefully removed the roots. He was afraid that if he were to damage the root system, the vine would not be able to survive!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui played a round of hide and seek with the lass and transplanted the vine in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Thereafter, Qing Shui fiddled about this “Wondrous Fruit” which searching the vicinity. Qing Shui was puzzled on why there were no demonic beasts guarding the fruit. If there weren’t any, the fruit would have been plucked off long ago. Could it be because the “Wondrous Fruit” was not of a high quality?</p>
 <p>After making a round, he did not discover anything else. The bored lass had fallen asleep in his arms. Since it was late, he let the groggy lass tell the White Feathered Condor to head back to Cloud Mist Peak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Wondrous Fruit that was emitting a faint red light, feeling that it shouldn’t just be considered bad. In these past days, he had spent his time exploring the dangerous spots in the area, but he had not manage to find anything good. While he did find a few items that he thought were good, it was after he had checked with Yiye Jiange that he was laughed at and told that they were rubbish. </p>
 <p>When they returned to Cloud Mist peak, Yiye Jiange was in front of the hall, as if waiting for him and the lass! He felt very happy, and oddly overjoyed.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange stepped up to carry the lass in Qing Shui’s arms. The slender hands make his heart pound when it touched his chest.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange said softly to Qing Shui, “You’re back!”</p>
 <p>When she saw the Wondrous Fruit in Qing Shui’s hands, she said in astonishment, “Wondrous Fruit!”</p>
 <p>“Hmmm, you know about this?” Qing Shui asked happily, feeling overjoyed. So it was still called the Wondrous Fruit. Seeing Yiye Jiange’s stunned face, it must be something good.</p>
 <p>“The Wondrous Fruit is one of the most amazing fruits in the land of the nine continents and it is extremely precious.” Yiye Jiange touched the Wondrous Fruit happily and said.</p>
 <p>“What effects does it have? How precious is it?”</p>
 <p>“The fruit is best given to children below 12 years old to increase their potential. Each child can only take one to increase 10% of their overall potential. During the process of cultivation in the future, the speed of the child’s progress would increase by another 10%.” Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Are there any side effects?” Qing Shui asked. The Wondrous Fruit that he previously knew of had come with side effects.</p>
 <p>“No. Did you hear that it has?” Yiye Jiange asked, feeling strange.</p>
 <p>“Let Luan Luan have it. The lass had discovered it with her sharp eyes.” Qing Shui passed it to Yiye Jiange who was carrying the lass.</p>
 <p>“Actually, this can increase the lass’s lifespan by three years. 10% of her potential would be equivalent to 10% of her lifespan. The Wondrous Fruit is amazing in that it could increase every ability of the person who took it. For children below twelve years old, it would increase the progress of their cultivation by 10% in the future.” Yiye Jiange slowly explained.</p>
 <p>“Only children below twelve years old can enjoy that 10% increase in their cultivation speed?”</p>
 <p>“Mmm, but when a Xiantian eats it, it can increase all of his abilities at once by 10% and their lifespan by fifty years.” Yiye Jiange held onto the Wondrous Fruit and said as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“So what if we get fifty more years to our lives. Even if it can only increase the lass’s lifespan by three days, we must still give it to her. Each additional day brings more hope.” Qing Shui sighed and said seriously.</p>
