 <p><strong>Chapter 340 Divine Arm Clearing and Divine Feet Clearing Technique.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><span><strong>AST 340 - Divine Arm Clearing and Divine Feet Clearing Technique</strong> </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui really liked how she was sly and cunning with a bit of quick-wittedness and attractive femininity. But Qing Shui knew that the reason she behaved this way was to tease him.</span></p>
  <p><span>She had a sense of femininity to her and was calm and collected, like a ripple set in motion. A woman who can depend on her inner temperament and make anyone fall in love with her is the most feminine woman ever.</span></p>
  <p><span>Femininity is a kind of elegance, a kind of lasting appeal, a kind of shyness, a kind of meaning, and a kind of flavour.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Why don’t I come over tonight? It will be real this time and you get to do whatever you want, alright?”</span></p>
  <p><span>“Sure!”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui smiled and calmly held her waist, his hand touching her round delicate hips. He had always felt shocked and newfangled every time he felt the soft bouncy sensation. Qing Shui will never grow tired of it.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui liked her and he knew that Huoyun Liu-li liked him too, so he didn’t mind doing intimate gestures with her. Moreover, he had already decided to keep her by his side forever.</span></p>
  <p><span>Huoyun Liu-li’s delicate body shrivelled a little. She glanced at Qing Shui but she didn’t dodge away from the mischievous hands touching her sensitive area.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui smiled and evaded her gaze. His fingers touched the ecstatic crevice between the hips, and only when he was evading Huoyun Liu-li’s angry gaze did he notice that Canghai Mingyue was looking at him.</span></p>
  <p><span>Moreover, she was looking at his hand</span><span>—</span><span>the hand that was touching Huoyun Liu-li’s hip area...</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui laughed awkwardly and quickly withdrew his hands while Canghai Mingyue stared at him with a mixture of annoyance and shyness. On the other hand, Qing Shui was enjoying her gaze.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui knew that both women had their meridians blocked in many places. Thus, he also knew that it will take a longer time if both of them wanted to master their Divinity Protection.</span></p>
  <p><span>He kept in mind of the Divinity Protection technique and decided to go back. After all, his goal of coming here was to memorize the Divinity Protection technique. The rest of the practice would depend on himself. As for the practice, it would take a few more times to master it.</span></p>
  <p><span>What Qing Shui wanted to do now was see what the reward from the 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique was. Although he could see the reward from where he was, Qing Shui didn’t want to be lost in thought there.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, he still stayed there until the sky became dark. Only then did he return back home. Of course, Huoyun Liu-li didn’t follow Qing Shui and let him do what he wanted to her. He noticed that he liked how Huoyun Liu-li was when she was with him.</span></p>
  <p><span>Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
  <p><span>Only after Qing Shui had come inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal did he go to the assistive skills that he had not seen for a long time. During that time when he had a breakthrough, Qing Shui didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary about his surprise and the situation at that time. He even forgot about the rewards of the techniques, as well as the mastery that came with the 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
  <p><span>Submerge in a sea of consciousness!</span></p>
  <p><span>Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui had never thought that the reward from the 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique would be this Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
  <p><span>“That’s not right, during the 2nd layer, I remembered already learning how to escape and pursue. Was I wrong?” Qing Shui became very depressed.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui quickly went back to look at his skills and noticed that the “escape” he had learned in the beginning eventually had the Ghostly Steps and etc. This was because running away depended on the best landscape and surroundings, as well as one’s speed. Qing Shui thought of Pursue later on by using reverse thinking. So escaping is also a disguise for pursuing.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui continued to look at the Pursuing &nbsp;technique. As he looked into it, he understood that this pursuing was not the same as the pursuing he was thinking about. He felt especially happy after he looked at it. Although it was just a simple introduction of the technique, it was very practical.</span></p>
  <p><span>It turns out that this Art of Pursuing is actually a type of “heavy loading Qi Force”, which is also an assistive skill. It can be blended in with any skills, especially when attacking an opponent. This kind of Qi Force can be inflicted into the opponent’s body, causing them to gain extra an load and decreasing their speed!</span></p>
  <p><span>But in regards to what extent it decreased, Qing Shui noticed that there might be some connection with the realm he would be practicing in. A small success stage can add 5% in the total load, which will also decrease 5% of the total speed.</span></p>
  <p><span>A large success stage can add 10% to the total load, and subsequently decrease 10% of the total speed!</span></p>
  <p><span>A great perfection stage can ultimately add 20% to the total load, which will decrease 20% of the overall speed!</span></p>
  <p><span>“Crap, there is actually such a perverted skill that will weaken the opponent to increase my status.” Qing Shui could not resist swearing as he finished observing his skill.</span></p>
  <p><span>Surprisingly, the skill to add to the load of the opponent while simultaneously decreases their speed was based on numbers!</span></p>
  <p><span>“So perverted!”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui was delighted as he thought about decreasing an on-par opponent’s speed by two fold while adding two folds of a load on the opponent. Wasn’t this a death wish….</span></p>
  <p><span>The concentration technique of this “heavy load” Art of Pursuing below the skill indicated that the duration would not be very long. Similarly to the basics of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, other people will be able to learn it as well, but they could only achieve half of the effect if they work twice as hard.</span></p>
  <p><span>At first, the speed of learning this skill was fast. Without much time, one will be able to feel the Qi Force from the Art of Pursuing. After a few cycles, Qing Shui stopped. The rest of it would be accumulated through time.</span></p>
  <p><span>Two days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal have passed. Qing Shui went to eat some food again. Around this time, he continued looking at the skill. The reward for the beginning of the Art of Pursuing is considered good. </span></p>
  <p><span>Acupuncture Point Clearing Art!</span></p>
  <p><span>The acupuncture point within a human body is a peculiar thing. After the acupuncture points have been cleared, one will be able to obtain a miraculous result and a great benefit!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui was speechless when he saw that. He even exclaimed that he had no clue of how to clear the acupuncture points during the day. But now, without needing any slight of effort, the technique has appeared in front of him.</span></p>
  <p><span>He would only have himself to blame for thinking about it now. If he had made an estimation after analyzing the skill, he wouldn’t have to think about what he had thought during the day! Then he wouldn’t have to feel mystical about it.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui then continued on!</span></p>
  <p><span>“The acupuncture points are distributed among the meridians. Clearing the acupuncture points will largely benefit the meridians. Not only it will strengthen the meridians, but the meridians will be able to bear a lot more of Qi of Xiantian. That, in turn, will also leave the meridians unobstructed, allowing more capacity for a swift flow.”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui continued below. It was the Twelve Channels and the Eight Miraculous Vessels!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui knew that the acupuncture points are distributed among the Twelve Channels and the Eight Extra Vessels!</span></p>
  <p><span>The Twelve Channels include Three Yin Channels of Hand, Three Yang Channels of Hand, Three Yin Channels of Foot, and Three Yang Channels of Foot!</span></p>
  <p><span>The Eight Miraculous Vessels included the Governing Vessel, Conception Vessel, Penetrating Vessel, Girdle Vessel, Yin Heel Vessel, Yang Heel Vessel, Yin Linking Vessel, and Yang Linking Vessel!</span></p>
  <p><span>Besides, there were also a few hidden acupuncture points within the human body. When the time came, there would be an opportunity to discover them!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui only knew that there were actually a few more hidden acupuncture points other than the known 408 acupuncture points. Whether it was the truth or not, time will tell!</span></p>
  <p><span>“The art of acupuncture point clearing techniques are divided into application clearing, medicine clearing, spiritual clearing, acupuncture clearing!” Qing Shui discovered that there were actually that many techniques to clear the acupuncture points. He then sighed in relief.</span></p>
  <p><span>Then he continued because he noticed that he hadn’t even seen the concrete arts of acupuncture clearing!</span></p>
  <p><span>Application clearing techniques, this was the acupuncture clearing technique that professionals use. But this type of clearing could only clear some small acupuncture points in a human body, as well as the other 108 acupuncture points that could not be cleared by application clearing.</span></p>
  <p><span>Medicine clearing techniques, this was the clearing done through medicinal pills. There were a few miraculous medicinal pills that could clear specific acupuncture points! Medicine clearing was able to clear any acupuncture points, but the components of the medicinal pills were extremely precious and rare.</span></p>
  <p><span>Spiritual clearing techniques, when a human was in deep thought and concentrates on some things</span><span>—</span><span>for example, during the moment of enlightenment</span><span>—</span><span>there was a possibility that specific acupuncture points would be cleared. </span></p>
  <p><span>Acupuncture clearing techniques, clearing acupuncture points could be done with the miraculous acupuncture technique. Similar to Application clearing, this type of clearing could only clear some small acupuncture points. The other 108 acupuncture points could not be cleared through this clearing.</span></p>
  <p><span>Beat clearing techniques, when fighting, massaging, boxing, and etc., there was a possibility in clearing acupuncture points unintentionally. But the chances were slim, and similarly, only a few small acupuncture points could be cleared. The other 108 acupuncture points could not be cleared through this “beating” clearing as well.</span></p>
  <p><span>As he read that, Qing Shui was a bit speechless because he noticed that acupuncture clearing was not as simple as he thought it would be. He didn’t know if the “art of application clearing” could be used for down there. if there couldn’t, then it was temporarily useless. Moreover, the application clearing was still unable to clear the most important 108 acupuncture points within the body.</span></p>
  <p><span>Medicine clearing, however, could clear any acupuncture points, but using this clearing might prove to be more difficult, as Qing Shui knew about the difficulty of refining medicinal pills.</span></p>
  <p><span>Spiritual clearing could also clear any acupuncture points, but how couldl the moment of enlightenment appear that easily…?</span></p>
  <p><span>Acupuncture clearing could work, but it was still uncertain whether the Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique would be able to achieve that. It was worth to test it out in the future. However, similar to application clearing, only a few small acupuncture points could be cleared.</span></p>
  <p><span>But as for the last beat clearing, Qing Shui felt that this technique would be like a blind cat trying to catch a dead mouse!</span></p>
  <p><span>However, Qing Shui still thought of his own saintly hands as he mused about the idea of using those saintly hands to practice “Soft-Tendon Hand Technique” and help “massage” Huoyun Liu-li. He still didn’t know if he had cleared her acupuncture points…</span></p>
  <p><span>Just then, Qing Shui suddenly thought about that charming and gentle scene. Every time he thought about it, he would feel the softness on his hands, especially when he squeezed her firm hips, that feeling on his hand….</span></p>
  <p><span>He forced himself not to think of those stuff and continued to read. Finally, he reached to the point that he was looking forward to!</span></p>
  <p><span>Acupuncture Point Clearing Technique!</span></p>
  <p><span>Too bad this is a technique for only two hands, two arms, two legs, and two feet.</span></p>
  <p><span>Divine Arm Clearing Technique!</span></p>
  <p><span>Divine Feet Clearing Technique!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui looked at these two tacky names, but he still felt happy about it. It didn’t matter how it was, anything was always better than nothing. If a man’s heart was not content, it would be like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. If the Divine Arm Clearing and Divine Feet Clearing hadn’t existed, then he would have to submit himself.</span></p>
  <p><span>As the name indicated on the Divine Arm Clearing, refining this technique would only clear the acupuncture points on both arms and hands. The small success stage realm would clear 3 acupuncture points, the large success stage realm would clear 6 acupuncture points, and the great perfection stage realm would clear 15 acupuncture points. It was still uncertain which acupuncture points those would be.</span></p>
  <p><span>That included every points on the arm.</span></p>
  <p><span>“This little?” Qing Shui was having doubts. Even in the great perfection stage realm, two arms would only equal to 24 acupuncture points...</span></p>
  <p><span>Divine Feet Clearing, refining this technique would only clear the acupuncture points on both legs and feet. The small success stage realm would clear 3 acupuncture points, the large success stage realm would clear 6 acupuncture points, and the great perfection stage realm would clear 15 acupuncture points!</span></p>
  <p><span>That was stingy. Before then, the great perfection stage realm would always have greater effects and results. After all, it would require talent to master the great perfection stage. If Qing Shui pass on his technique to other people, they would only master half of the great perfection stage.</span></p>
  <p><span>But as he thought about Mingyue Gelou’s improvement, which was faster than Qing Shui’s, this made him feel that the problem was either because of her cleared acupuncture channels or the intimate stuff they did together.</span></p>
  <p><span>Whatever it was, it was still a good thing that Mingyue Gelou was able to refine her initial tiger form to the great perfection stage and have a tremendous potential.</span></p>
  <p><span>There were a few more women whom he had similarly given a set of assistive skills. Qing Shui has the biggest hope on Luan Luan, because that little one was a seven apertures mystical heart.</span></p>

 <p><span>Qing Shui knew that both women had their meridians blocked in many places. Thus, he also knew that it will take a longer time if both of them wanted to master their Divinity Protection.</span></p>
 <p><span>He kept in mind of the Divinity Protection technique and decided to go back. After all, his goal of coming here was to memorize the Divinity Protection technique. The rest of the practice would depend on himself. As for the practice, it would take a few more times to master it.</span></p>
 <p><span>What Qing Shui wanted to do now was see what the reward from the 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique was. Although he could see the reward from where he was, Qing Shui didn’t want to be lost in thought there.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, he still stayed there until the sky became dark. Only then did he return back home. Of course, Huoyun Liu-li didn’t follow Qing Shui and let him do what he wanted to her. He noticed that he liked how Huoyun Liu-li was when she was with him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
 <p><span>Only after Qing Shui had come inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal did he go to the assistive skills that he had not seen for a long time. During that time when he had a breakthrough, Qing Shui didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary about his surprise and the situation at that time. He even forgot about the rewards of the techniques, as well as the mastery that came with the 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
 <p><span>Submerge in a sea of consciousness!</span></p>
 <p><span>Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui had never thought that the reward from the 5th layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique would be this Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s not right, during the 2nd layer, I remembered already learning how to escape and pursue. Was I wrong?” Qing Shui became very depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui quickly went back to look at his skills and noticed that the “escape” he had learned in the beginning eventually had the Ghostly Steps and etc. This was because running away depended on the best landscape and surroundings, as well as one’s speed. Qing Shui thought of Pursue later on by using reverse thinking. So escaping is also a disguise for pursuing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui continued to look at the Pursuing &nbsp;technique. As he looked into it, he understood that this pursuing was not the same as the pursuing he was thinking about. He felt especially happy after he looked at it. Although it was just a simple introduction of the technique, it was very practical.</span></p>
 <p><span>It turns out that this Art of Pursuing is actually a type of “heavy loading Qi Force”, which is also an assistive skill. It can be blended in with any skills, especially when attacking an opponent. This kind of Qi Force can be inflicted into the opponent’s body, causing them to gain extra an load and decreasing their speed!</span></p>
 <p><span>But in regards to what extent it decreased, Qing Shui noticed that there might be some connection with the realm he would be practicing in. A small success stage can add 5% in the total load, which will also decrease 5% of the total speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>A large success stage can add 10% to the total load, and subsequently decrease 10% of the total speed!</span></p>
 <p><span>A great perfection stage can ultimately add 20% to the total load, which will decrease 20% of the overall speed!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Crap, there is actually such a perverted skill that will weaken the opponent to increase my status.” Qing Shui could not resist swearing as he finished observing his skill.</span></p>
 <p><span>Surprisingly, the skill to add to the load of the opponent while simultaneously decreases their speed was based on numbers!</span></p>
 <p><span>“So perverted!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was delighted as he thought about decreasing an on-par opponent’s speed by two fold while adding two folds of a load on the opponent. Wasn’t this a death wish….</span></p>
 <p><span>The concentration technique of this “heavy load” Art of Pursuing below the skill indicated that the duration would not be very long. Similarly to the basics of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, other people will be able to learn it as well, but they could only achieve half of the effect if they work twice as hard.</span></p>
 <p><span>At first, the speed of learning this skill was fast. Without much time, one will be able to feel the Qi Force from the Art of Pursuing. After a few cycles, Qing Shui stopped. The rest of it would be accumulated through time.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal have passed. Qing Shui went to eat some food again. Around this time, he continued looking at the skill. The reward for the beginning of the Art of Pursuing is considered good. </span></p>
 <p><span>Acupuncture Point Clearing Art!</span></p>
 <p><span>The acupuncture point within a human body is a peculiar thing. After the acupuncture points have been cleared, one will be able to obtain a miraculous result and a great benefit!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was speechless when he saw that. He even exclaimed that he had no clue of how to clear the acupuncture points during the day. But now, without needing any slight of effort, the technique has appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>He would only have himself to blame for thinking about it now. If he had made an estimation after analyzing the skill, he wouldn’t have to think about what he had thought during the day! Then he wouldn’t have to feel mystical about it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui then continued on!</span></p>
 <p><span>“The acupuncture points are distributed among the meridians. Clearing the acupuncture points will largely benefit the meridians. Not only it will strengthen the meridians, but the meridians will be able to bear a lot more of Qi of Xiantian. That, in turn, will also leave the meridians unobstructed, allowing more capacity for a swift flow.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui continued below. It was the Twelve Channels and the Eight Miraculous Vessels!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui knew that the acupuncture points are distributed among the Twelve Channels and the Eight Extra Vessels!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Twelve Channels include Three Yin Channels of Hand, Three Yang Channels of Hand, Three Yin Channels of Foot, and Three Yang Channels of Foot!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Eight Miraculous Vessels included the Governing Vessel, Conception Vessel, Penetrating Vessel, Girdle Vessel, Yin Heel Vessel, Yang Heel Vessel, Yin Linking Vessel, and Yang Linking Vessel!</span></p>
 <p><span>Besides, there were also a few hidden acupuncture points within the human body. When the time came, there would be an opportunity to discover them!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui only knew that there were actually a few more hidden acupuncture points other than the known 408 acupuncture points. Whether it was the truth or not, time will tell!</span></p>
 <p><span>“The art of acupuncture point clearing techniques are divided into application clearing, medicine clearing, spiritual clearing, acupuncture clearing!” Qing Shui discovered that there were actually that many techniques to clear the acupuncture points. He then sighed in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then he continued because he noticed that he hadn’t even seen the concrete arts of acupuncture clearing!</span></p>
 <p><span>Application clearing techniques, this was the acupuncture clearing technique that professionals use. But this type of clearing could only clear some small acupuncture points in a human body, as well as the other 108 acupuncture points that could not be cleared by application clearing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Medicine clearing techniques, this was the clearing done through medicinal pills. There were a few miraculous medicinal pills that could clear specific acupuncture points! Medicine clearing was able to clear any acupuncture points, but the components of the medicinal pills were extremely precious and rare.</span></p>
 <p><span>Spiritual clearing techniques, when a human was in deep thought and concentrates on some things</span><span>—</span><span>for example, during the moment of enlightenment</span><span>—</span><span>there was a possibility that specific acupuncture points would be cleared. </span></p>
 <p><span>Acupuncture clearing techniques, clearing acupuncture points could be done with the miraculous acupuncture technique. Similar to Application clearing, this type of clearing could only clear some small acupuncture points. The other 108 acupuncture points could not be cleared through this clearing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Beat clearing techniques, when fighting, massaging, boxing, and etc., there was a possibility in clearing acupuncture points unintentionally. But the chances were slim, and similarly, only a few small acupuncture points could be cleared. The other 108 acupuncture points could not be cleared through this “beating” clearing as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>As he read that, Qing Shui was a bit speechless because he noticed that acupuncture clearing was not as simple as he thought it would be. He didn’t know if the “art of application clearing” could be used for down there. if there couldn’t, then it was temporarily useless. Moreover, the application clearing was still unable to clear the most important 108 acupuncture points within the body.</span></p>
 <p><span>Medicine clearing, however, could clear any acupuncture points, but using this clearing might prove to be more difficult, as Qing Shui knew about the difficulty of refining medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p><span>Spiritual clearing could also clear any acupuncture points, but how couldl the moment of enlightenment appear that easily…?</span></p>
 <p><span>Acupuncture clearing could work, but it was still uncertain whether the Primal Chaotic Divine Needle Technique would be able to achieve that. It was worth to test it out in the future. However, similar to application clearing, only a few small acupuncture points could be cleared.</span></p>
 <p><span>But as for the last beat clearing, Qing Shui felt that this technique would be like a blind cat trying to catch a dead mouse!</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Qing Shui still thought of his own saintly hands as he mused about the idea of using those saintly hands to practice “Soft-Tendon Hand Technique” and help “massage” Huoyun Liu-li. He still didn’t know if he had cleared her acupuncture points…</span></p>
 <p><span>Just then, Qing Shui suddenly thought about that charming and gentle scene. Every time he thought about it, he would feel the softness on his hands, especially when he squeezed her firm hips, that feeling on his hand….</span></p>
 <p><span>He forced himself not to think of those stuff and continued to read. Finally, he reached to the point that he was looking forward to!</span></p>
 <p><span>Acupuncture Point Clearing Technique!</span></p>
 <p><span>Too bad this is a technique for only two hands, two arms, two legs, and two feet.</span></p>
 <p><span>Divine Arm Clearing Technique!</span></p>
 <p><span>Divine Feet Clearing Technique!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui looked at these two tacky names, but he still felt happy about it. It didn’t matter how it was, anything was always better than nothing. If a man’s heart was not content, it would be like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. If the Divine Arm Clearing and Divine Feet Clearing hadn’t existed, then he would have to submit himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>As the name indicated on the Divine Arm Clearing, refining this technique would only clear the acupuncture points on both arms and hands. The small success stage realm would clear 3 acupuncture points, the large success stage realm would clear 6 acupuncture points, and the great perfection stage realm would clear 15 acupuncture points. It was still uncertain which acupuncture points those would be.</span></p>
 <p><span>That included every points on the arm.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This little?” Qing Shui was having doubts. Even in the great perfection stage realm, two arms would only equal to 24 acupuncture points...</span></p>
 <p><span>Divine Feet Clearing, refining this technique would only clear the acupuncture points on both legs and feet. The small success stage realm would clear 3 acupuncture points, the large success stage realm would clear 6 acupuncture points, and the great perfection stage realm would clear 15 acupuncture points!</span></p>
 <p><span>That was stingy. Before then, the great perfection stage realm would always have greater effects and results. After all, it would require talent to master the great perfection stage. If Qing Shui pass on his technique to other people, they would only master half of the great perfection stage.</span></p>
 <p><span>But as he thought about Mingyue Gelou’s improvement, which was faster than Qing Shui’s, this made him feel that the problem was either because of her cleared acupuncture channels or the intimate stuff they did together.</span></p>
 <p><span>Whatever it was, it was still a good thing that Mingyue Gelou was able to refine her initial tiger form to the great perfection stage and have a tremendous potential.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were a few more women whom he had similarly given a set of assistive skills. Qing Shui has the biggest hope on Luan Luan, because that little one was a seven apertures mystical heart.</span></p>
