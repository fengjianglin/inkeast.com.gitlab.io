 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, Yang Can received a significant boost in his strength and managed to suppress Yan Yujiang rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strength wasn’t the only factor in a battle between warriors. Actual battle experience, martial techniques and the mastery of their battle techniques also played prominent roles to decide the outcome of a battle. The other factor was the warrior's talent to utilize their Force of Heavenly Dao. All of these factors shouldn't be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Yang Can has managed to suppress Yan Yujiang with his own martial technique. He constantly unleashed formidable techniques as if he was about to turn over the entire ocean. It seemed like he planned to take down Yan Yujiang with one move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his action also seemed unrealistic. Though Yan Yujiang might be at a disadvantage for now, he hasn’t been suppressed to the point where he lost his rhythm. Very quickly, threads of white smoke began emerging around his body. They looked as hazy as steam, which made him very hard to be discerned with naked eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Song of Ocean Demons!</span></p>

However this time, it seemed stronger. This was a Battle Melody, its purpose was to increase the morale of the user and to lower his opponent's at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Yang Can lost the advantage he had, while Yan Yujiang seemed gradually like a fish that got back into the water. Initially, he was in a rush to kill Yang Can, but now he seemed to have gotten calmer and was no longer feeling rushed to do so. He looked more like a cat that’s playing with a mouse now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tyrant King Spear!</span></p>

After that, a dominant aura burst out of his body. He thrust out the spear in his hand while tightening his body like a bow. His entire body, along with his spear, turned into a huge sharp bow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yujiang no longer underestimated Yang Can. Suddenly, a huge and heavy ice wall appeared around him. The ice was formed by Origin Qi, making it many times tougher than Mystic Steel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Hu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Can immediately thrust out the spear abruptly along with his body as he formed a jet-black rift in the sky. At the same time, a bright and dazzling spark was also spotted across the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fragments of ice scattered around the entire sky. Within it, there were also two human figures that were separated from each other. Yang Can seemed a bit exhausted and so was Yan Yujiang. His chest was moving up and down in an exaggerated manner. At the corner of his mouth, a trace of fresh blood could also be spotted. However, Qing Shui could tell that the opponent had only been inflicted with a light injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You used your killer-move! Now, die for me!” Upon speaking, the fork in his hand became transparent. It shot out a snow light beam that was about three feet long and gave out hissing noises resembling that of a snake hiss. Anyone who heard the noise would shiver because of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Can felt a bit sad. He knew that he couldn’t beat the opponent, but he was like a hot-blooded man who couldn’t control himself even though he knew that the opponent was setting up a trap for him. Nevertheless, he didn’t regret doing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rage of Yaksha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aura across Yan Yujiang’s body once again rose by a huge chunk. After that, he threw the fork towards Yang Can. The fork locked onto him like a target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Can’s expression looked a bit ugly. His eyes still looked very firm. While holding the long spear tightly in his hand, he threw it out without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One Spear Obliterating the River!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the instant when he unleashed it, an abundant foreign aura engulfed him. It felt like he put on a thick armor around his body and his speed also rose sharply along with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Contrary to Yang Can, Yan Yujiang trembled. It felt as if he had lost all of his powers. He slowed down a lot and his strength diminished. In just a while, Yan Yujiang was already feeling very panicked, panicked to the extent that he even forgot he was in a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No distractions must be allowed when two experts were crossing fists. As this delay occurred to Yan Yujiang, he was totally done for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yujiang got blown backward. He spurted out fresh blood while in mid-air. The entire tide of battle got reversed by Qing Shui. Yang Yujiang, who was supposed to be at absolute advantage actually got blown out far away…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the area became clear again, everyone was still puzzled, it’s to the extent that even Yang Can and Yang Yujiang didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yujiang got severely injured. His injuries were fatal. At the same time, Yang Can also went all out and risked his life. After all, in this kind of situation, he had already accepted the fact that he might die and unleashed a strike with all his might. It could be called a technique which put everything at stake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Can hadn’t really suffered injuries. Yan Yujiang on the other hand, was heavily injured. In mid-air, he constantly spurted out fresh blood from his mouth. This setback convinced the people around that he was injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Can was a smart and ruthless person. It was just like the saying “to kill you while you are sick”. Considering that the opponents didn’t leave him with any paths to retreat back then, he also didn’t feel any sympathy towards him. At this moment, not cutting off the loose ends would have been a very stupid act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Can body flashed as he attacked Yan Yujiang who had blown backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still other experts on Yan Yujiang’s side. Seeing the sudden change in the tide of the battle, they quickly charged towards Yang Can in an attempt to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the people of the Northern Yang Palace wasn’t just for show either. A few elderly men quickly made their move, “Ocean Demon Palace, you guys have bullied people like they were nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge were standing on top of the White Jade Dragon while observing the chaotic battle in front of them. They knew that this time, even if the Ocean Demon Palace didn’t lose all of its members here, they would still suffer grave damages. For a short period of time, it’s impossible for them to regain their strength back. By the time they did, the difference between Qing Shui and them would be like heaven and earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people from Ocean Demon Palace escaped. Almost half of them died. Similarly, Yan Yujiang also fled. However, Qing Shui knew that regardless of whether he managed to stay alive or not, he was already done for. It wouldn’t require other people to take action, the people of Ocean Demon Palace themselves would have done the job. Someone would replace Yan Clan to become the Palace Lord of Ocean Demon Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The slightly beaten up Yang Can came back and went up to Qing Shui. He said in a serious tone, “Senior, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Yang Can might not know what happened, he was aware that the thing which happened before must be connected to the young man. This was a kind of intuition. Across the world of martial arts, age was just a number. The only things they took regard of was the strength. A person with more strength was respected by more people. Hence, it’s normal that Yang Can would address Qing Shui as his senior.</span></p>

The Ocean Demon Palace is too unreasonable and arrogant. They are bound to come across unfortunate things sooner or later.”</span></p>

There are a lot of Ocean Demon Palaces, and this is only one of them. Senior, please be careful. In the future, if there is anything I can do, please inform me. No matter what it is, I will jump into the Sea of Flames without hesitation.” Yang Can said in a serious tone.</span></p>

Will senior fancy to pay us a visit so that I can have a chance to thank you properly?” Yang Can said in a careful tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Call me Qing Shui, I should be younger than you. If you don’t mind, why don’t we be friends? I will address you as Brother Yang, does that sound alright with you?” Qing Shui smiled and asked. He could tell that the Lord of Northern Yang Palace should be someone with decent personalities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That sounds great! I couldn’t have asked for more. However, the things which I said before still counts!”</span></p>

Since there are still things I need to deal with for the time being, Will it be alright if I pay Brother Yang a visit after I come back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Younger brother Qing Shui, I can tell that you are in a rush. I am not sure if it is right for me to ask this, but is there anything which I, as your elder brother, may be of help?” Yang Can asked cautiously while observing Qing Shui’s expression.</span></p>

I am on my way to the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave to look for it.”</span></p>
