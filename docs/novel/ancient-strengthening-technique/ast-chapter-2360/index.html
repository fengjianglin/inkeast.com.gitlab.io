 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2360 - Sincerity, Divine Palace Moving to Crystal City</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things had calmed down and the Water Emperor quickly cleaned up the rest. Qing Shui, on the other hand, had nothing to do. He decided to simply relax for a few days, drink wine, tease women, live the good life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Emperor had treated Qing Shui many times in small family feasts. There were only so many of the Nalan family members, all of which were directly related to the Water Emperor. Qing Shui and Nalan Qing were also present. In the Water Emperor’s eyes, Qing Shui was already his son-in-law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Nalan Qing was still known as a widow, so to a certain extent, the Water Emperor and his family felt that it was an outmarriage. After all, Qing Shui was still so young, and more powerful that it seemed as though he was out of her league.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn’t propose while the Water Emperor dared not sanction a marriage either, as he didn’t possess the qualifications. It wasn’t a gap in status, but there were just too many complications.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui always stayed in Nalan Qing’s palace, being in contact with her from day to night. For such an exceptional person, he had seen many beauties. However, men are just like this, especially with no woman to manage them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was difficult to control urges once one became a man. Those men who wanted to satisfy their urges could hold it for a year or two. However, becoming a true man would make one’s urges uncontrollable and even ruin lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This period of time made Nalan Qing very happy. The burden on her was gone and she was a lot more relaxed, with the world seeming much more pleasant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Shui, I’m so happy!” Nalan Qing said to Qing Shui after looking at her surroundings and the blue sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, this is your third time saying it,” Qing Shui said, smiling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“ I’m just happy. Why are you so irritated?” Nalan Qing glared at Qing Shui, displeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could I be irritated by you, you lustrous, lovely beauty. I can’t even fall in love with you fast enough!” Qing Shui praised her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing smiled with glee. She did not know when she got so close to him, and felt as though they were getting to know each other even more. However, every time she remembered she was a widow, she felt slightly depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you thinking about? Why are you so sad? Didn’t you just tell me that you were happy?” Qing Shui said, seeing the sadness in Nalan Qing’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing. How long will you be staying here for?” Nalan Qing asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you trying to get rid of me?! You can’t do this, darling. You can’t burn our bridge…” Qing Shui ranted on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing looked at Qing Shui silently while he was blabbering on. This man, not only had he changed how he called her, he had also said somethings that had left her dumbfounded. She knew Qing Shui did it on purpose, and that he did not mean them. He was just joking and was just messing with her. Just for the way he addressed her…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not too sure, either. I might leave soon, or I might stay for a while longer,” Qing Shui replied with uncertainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve helped me so much. How could I ever repay you?” Nalan Qing said seriously to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you take me as your friend then stop thinking about this.” Qing Shui laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are my best friend!” Nalan Qing hurriedly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How good is best?” Qing Shui replied, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m willing to give you my all, willingly, including my life,” Nalan Qing replied softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui knew that she was serious about what she said. He understood her thoughts. She placed great meaning on debts of gratitude. He extended his arm and caressed her head and said, “Dummy, with me here, no one would ever dare to touch you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he said this, he felt that his actions were slightly inappropriate. If Nalan Qing was a young girl, it would not have been that bad. However, though she was an inexperienced girl, she still had a mature personality, and should have been slightly older than Qing Shui. So it felt slightly inappropriate, and it made Qing Shui feel even stranger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was not only him who felt strange. It was the same for Nalan Qing. She had an even greater sense of an indescribable emotion, as if her feelings had been stirred. If it was in the past, she would not have had been able to imagine someone saying such things to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui retracted his hand awkwardly. Nalan Qing, however, laughed and looked at Qing Shui. She now smiled from time to time, like the spring sun or white snow. It was especially stunning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must keep your word!” Nalan Qing exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crystal City was the most beautiful place Qing Shui had ever seen. This was also one of the important reasons why Qing Shui decided to stay for a longer period.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui now had to decide whether or not to settle on this place and move the Divine Palace here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This problem in itself was quite messy. Here, Qing Shui’s power could be said to be the best, but this city’s Guardian Beast was slightly stronger. Strictly speaking, the Divine Battle Puppet could definitely fight evenly with the Crystal Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not be sure. He really wanted to know the Crystal Dragon’s strength, then decide if he should settle down here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To know the Crystal Dragon’s power, he could only ask the Water Emperor. The Water Emperor’s power had reached about 4.5 trillion Dao, similar to Qing Shui. There were countless of nations around, yet the Water Emperor was not at the peak of the Demon King Domain. This was another reason for hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally decided to settle here, since the atmosphere was simply superb. Furthermore, the Water Nation seemed to be linked to Qing Shui by fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The position was set in Crystal City, and the place was already bought, a gift by the Water Emperor. Qing Shui told the Water Emperor about his idea to temporarily move the Divine Palace here. If The Water Emperor didn’t allow it, he wouldn’t bother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Contrary to his expectations, the Water Emperor happily accepted and even gave him a great location.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Emperor had thought about it thoroughly. If Qing Shui had any hidden agenda towards the Water Nation, he would not be able to stop him anyway. Furthermore, the Nalan clan was indebted to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui explained his thoughts, he was meticulous with his observations. He knew the Water Emperor had to accept his ideas. After all, Qing Shui had helped them with so much. However, he was very cautious about this. If the opposite party had any hidden reservations about the plan, Qing Shui would not force them. This world was so big, he chose the place just for the view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the Water Emperor did not show any unwillingness, and even looked very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Palace was positioned in Crystal city. However, it was far from the imperial palace. It was a fresh-looking nine-story pagoda, with a base the size of a football field, standing at an impressive 100 meters in height.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few days, Qing Shui used the Five elements Divine Flag to return, then bring everyone back here. A whole day was used to bring them to and fro. But Qing Shui could actually use just a moment to do so if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan and Shen Huang were captivated by the place. Everyone would also be entranced without exception every time they were first brought here. It was simply too beautiful. They said that every girl had a dream kingdom in which they were the princess. Crystal City most definitely was a kingdom worth dreaming about.</span></p>
