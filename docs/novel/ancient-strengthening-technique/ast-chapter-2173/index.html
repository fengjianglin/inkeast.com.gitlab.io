 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw it with his heavenly vision technique. It was indeed the tilted moon branch. Now all that was missing was the lightning fruit, which was all he needed to create the Calamity Evasion Pill. He had no idea what it actually did but from what it seemed, it would increase the probability of evasion. But was it False God Tribulation, or Divine Tribulation?</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for how it would evade calamity, there was no way for him to find out about it.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Qing Shui himself had a predestined fate, he wouldn’t use the pill. All in all, that lightning could be used to better his own body. If he lost that, it would come at a loss. However, many people would rather not have this and would rather stay in this position forever as if they made a breakthrough, it might cost them their lives.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan went back to the Divine Shrine since it wasn’t that safe here. At the very least, the Divine Shrine was secured. The insignificant screams and shouts of the enemy wouldn’t be able to infiltrate it. Zhang Yue was also a doctor with low strength, so he wouldn’t bring much attention.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those people had a clear-cut goal and wouldn’t needlessly stir up trouble, nor would they reveal themselves before they were ready. As a result, Qing Shui wasn’t worried. Their target is most likely him. Otherwise, Beihuang Fan wouldn’t have gone to protect him.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the last fight, Qing Shui’s strength would have definitely piqued the interest of the Demon Gate and other people. Therefore, if they were thinking of waging war with the Taiyi Immortal Palace and the Divine Palace, they must get rid of Qing Shui first or their own aces would be assassinated.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a sea of people here, but his strength alone was able to stir the entire battle.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At night, Qing Shui naturally wouldn’t let Beihuang Fan share a room with him. He still needed to go into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to do anything more than what friends would do together with her in the room, so he would rather not have to deal with that.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui began to make the Golden Martial King Pill. To a normal person, this item was definitely good, but it can only be consumed by someone who had previously consumed the Xiantian Golden Pellet or was a Xiantian Martial Artist, so the requirements were a little steep. In comparison, it wasn’t as valuable as the Xiantian Golden Pellet, which one could be used by normal people. However, Xiantian Martial Artists were only a small percentage even in the Northern Emperor Domain so fundamentally, most people were unable to get to that rank.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, for those who had eaten the Xiantian Golden Pellet, this Golden Martial King Pill was naturally much more valuable. The rich people within the common populace or within the Xiantian Martial Artists would desire it so much, they would be willing to part with all their wealth for just one of these two pills.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking up the Golden Martial King Pill that he had just created, Qing Shui got ready to go back to let his family have it. His mother and a few of his uncles and aunts were Xiantian Martial Artists and could use this pill, which was why only the Golden Martial King Pill would be able to raise their strength.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he came out, it was almost the start of the second day. It was early from the standpoint of a lot of other people. The build of people in this world was good, so even if they had only slept for four hours, it would be sufficient. Sleeping late and waking early was something that was distinct to the Nine Continents.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he came out, he found Beihuang Fan calmly drinking tea in the guest room and shocked Qing Shui: “How did you get into this room?”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Would you like some tea?” Beihuang Fan dodged the question.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sat across from her: “Sure. Pour me one!”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the table, there was a tea set. Beihuang Fan poured Qing Shui a cup, which he finished in a gulp and put in front of her.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan filled the cup again, and Qing Shui gulped it down once more.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This happened a few more times, until Beihuang Fan finally said: “Pour it yourself.”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whatever, I’m going to drink some water. This teapot has too little and is not enough for me..” Qing Shui left with a smile and poured himself some water.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan wanted to give Qing Shui the teapot.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After drinking some water, Qing Shui sat back down. Watching this proper woman drink tea was quite nice. He then said with a smile: “Do you do anything other than training?”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah. Drinking tea, drawing, playing the zither...”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was intrigued. He didn’t think that this woman would be so talented in so many ways. An idea appeared in his head as he brought out a phoenix zither: “Would you like to play a song for me?”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Out!” Beihuang Fan threw the teacup in her hand at Qing Shui, almost hitting his face. This bastard dared to make her play a song for him...</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui released a breath of air, knowing that it was the limit. However, he still wanted her to play: “Why doesn’t the younger one play a song for the old folk?”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan didn’t say a word.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui ended up playing a song, the Iron Horse and Golden Dragon, War Drums and Thunder Roll. This was a song that made people’s blood rush, like the relaxation of an oppressed people rising up against their oppressors. That feeling would make one want to do the same.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Beihuang Fan didn’t appear to be moved much, at this time, he felt that her blood was rushing quicker. Qing Shui played very well. His control was extremely good, and Beihuang Fan couldn’t find any flaws.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t think that you could play the zither. At first, I only thought that you would try to gulp it down.” Beihuang Fan laughed.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also didn’t think that this woman would make a joke like that, speaking: “Actually, there are many things that I know, like drawing. Since we’re not really doing anything now, I could draw something for you!”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said this he took out the Golden Calligraphy Brush and paper, as well as the colors he needed.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan was going to stop him, but she was also interested, and let him continue.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he drew, Beihuang Fan was slowly being surprised. Qing Shui seemed to have already internalized the surroundings, just like a still life. This was a type of feeling, and his drawing also gave the illusion of life.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, there seemed to be an air of uncertainty surrounding him. His strokes were extremely smooth and purposeful. With each stroke, he started a new color, moving so quickly that his brush seemed to never leave the paper, doing it in one motion.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui was done the entire painting teemed with life. A faint murmur was conversing with Beihuang Fan.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shocked. It was a Portrait of Beauty!</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was extremely moved. He could determine that this must be a Portrait of Beauty and that he had created one. But he knew that it truly wasn’t him who had created this, but rather that Beihuang Fan was comparable to the woman in the Portrait of Beauty, even surpassing it a little.</span></span></p>

She didn’t think that it would become such a lively image. She was a part of the Divine Connection Realm, and could naturally tell the special part of this drawing.</span></span></p>

Although it didn’t directly increase, the toughness, strength, and sturdiness of his bones had increased. This was an increase in material, not strength, just like the difference between iron silk and steel silk. Its thickness didn’t change, but became much tougher.</span></span></p>

He didn’t think that a day like this would come. At that time, Qing Shui knew that the twelve Portraits of Beauty could not have been representative of all of the beautiful girls. Now that he had confirmation, the Art Maestro having created the other twelve, somehow he had created one as well.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t think that creating one would increase his realm and strength by this much. As for the strength of the Art Maestro, Qing Shui naturally didn’t believe that he was only the level of a Martial Saint, or perhaps he was, before he created the twelve Portraits of Beauty. But after all, he could be a Martial Emperor.</span></p>
