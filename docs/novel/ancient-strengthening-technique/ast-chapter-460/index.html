 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">

  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 460 - One Year of Improvements, Refining the Beast Pill Again</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moreover, during this period, Qing Shui had made use of the Threefold Spirit Concentrating Pill. It was simply a pity that the Cloudmist Steps and Heavenly Thunder Slash had only reached the Truth Realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The biggest reward was that he was about to succeed in cultivating the Heavenly Dan as well as making the Binding Talisman, which could reduce the opponent's speed by twenty percent of Qing Shui’s speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that it was time to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wanted to condense the Heavenly Dan. Once he condensed the Heavenly Dan, he would gain 1 million jin of strength and defence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Circulating the Ancient Strengthening Technique was the basic task of every cultivating session. As of today, 179 cycles of Ancient Strengthening Technique allowed Qing Shui to reach the strength of 1 country with his body’s strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was why Qing Shui had the confidence to search for treasures at Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body’s strength had redoubled ever since he met the Old Ancestor, so feeling that surge of strength in his body eclipsing his state from a year ago made Qing Shui even more excited than seeing a pretty lady.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not wear any armor, nor did he equip himself with any weapons. Just like that, he slowly circulated his strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As well as the Core Qi Technique that increased vigor by 10%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just solely based on these, without borrowing any external assistance, he had achieved 22 million jin of strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hm, that’s not right!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly circulated the strength in his body, his senses had long reached the realm of Minute Subtlety and hence, he could tell that his strength was not actually 22 million jin of strength but 23 million jin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Where did the extra 1 million jin of strength come from?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew his Heavenly Dan had yet to take shape, so the 1 million Jin of strength could not come from that. But no matter how much he thought about it, he could not figure out an answer.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Frenzied Bull's Strength added 40% of the body’s strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Golden Qi added 50% of the body’s strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Thunder Slash added 30% of the body’s strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah, it’s Nature Energy!” Qing Shui shouted in surprise. He had actually forgotten about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had attained a breakthrough in Nature Energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy: it can increase 10% of all abilities. Even the chances of breaking through bottlenecks or opening acupoints will increase by 10%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not believe he had forgotten all about it. He only knew about the might of the Nature Energy, so he forgot that it could increase 10% of all abilities in the later stage. Originally, this kind of Righteous Qi could eradicate all evil things, capable of filling Qing Shui’s every move with Righteous Qi to suppress all. Regardless of any suppression, it had an unyielding vigor, giving a great increase in one’s chances of breaking through bottlenecks. Based on these boons alone, it was already a great skill, but Qing Shui was more-so surprised by its increase of the user’s strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart brightened up as a result. Although the road ahead was bumpy, it was equally filled with numerous opportunities. It was just a matter of whether he can grasp them or not.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without using any weapon, or any external strength, Qing Shui had achieved a little more than the strength of 2 countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, if he executed the Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strength of 5 countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared blankly. His own body had already reached the strength of 1 country,so &nbsp;this one stomp would be devastating. Qing Shui wanted to give it a try, but he gave up on this tempting idea.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then caused the surging energy in his body to settle. After his mental state had slowly calmed down, Qing Shui looked into his dantian, at the Upper Dantian he had cultivated for a year.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Inner vision!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His vision revealed the area around the Tianfu acupoint as a ball of misty clouds gradually converging into one. It was different from the cultivation of the Lower Dantian; the Upper Dantian would become a Heavenly Dan once successfully cultivated, containing a great strength built upon the foundations of the Lower Dantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: 天府 - Tianfu acupoint is located on the right arm about 3 inches below the level of the heart, about the level of where the Upper Dantian is in this novel.]</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confident that he could cultivate the Heavenly Dan, because the cloud in his Upper Dantian was getting denser and had earlier became a thick paste. Now, the coagulation speed could be seen with the naked eye.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time slowly passed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui swallowed the Sixfold Spirit Concentrating Pill and greatly increased his cultivating speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hey! I’m almost there!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly opened his eyes. Condensing the Heavenly Dan had failed at the final step. While he was certain he could succeed in one more try, it sadly had to wait for the next morrow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui ceased his cultivation of the Heavenly Dan, deciding to refine the Beast Pill first. He wanted to raise the strength of the Diamond Demonic Boar once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the 1 year, the Diamond Demonic Boar had spent a lot of time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Its food comprised the black fish, turtles, and crabs that were rich in Spiritual Qi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui could not stay in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for a long time, the Fire Bird and the Diamond Demonic Boar, as well as the creatures in the pond, could indefinitely remain inside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Refining the Beast Pills could have been done a year ago, as he had the ingredients ready then. But now, the quality of the ingredients were even better. Furthermore, Qing Shui had seen some improvement in regards to cultivating medicinal pills. Although he could not create new pills, he could add in some attributes or a supporting ingredient with matching elements, causing the effect of the pill to be better.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For example, in this Beast pill, Qing Shui added some Demonic beast's core, which was even a 3000 Year Demonic beast's core, as well as blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle, and the pearl powder from an oyster whose age exceed 1000.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During this year, after his strength had increased, Qing Shui realized that his primordial flames had undergone some changes. The size remained unchanged, but the color had attained a more gentle nuance, shifting hue to a pure gray color of equal amounts white and black.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not encounter much pressure refining the Beast Pill this time, for he had sufficient ingredients. Unlike when he attempted the Great Revitalizing Pellet, the ingredients had been prepared beforehand this time. The Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass had matured, but Qing Shui had unsuccessfully tried three times already. He had, however, harvested the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass multiple times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the refinement of the first batch succeeded, Qing Shui went to have some food in the interim as the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron was cooling down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While eating, Qing Shui’s state of mind wandered. The epiphany struck him – he no longer knew what he was living for. At first, it was for the sake of revenge. And in order to remove the burden from himself. But now Qing Shui was worried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Because once he cast away this burden, he had no other goals to chase after. Qing Shui did not have any great ambitions. He had neither thought about leaving a legend in the Central continent nor wanted to be an overlord.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s previously frantic cultivation was all for survival, so that he could live better without having to worry about others, to live with a sense of safety.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If there was no grudge with the Yan Clan, Qing Shui might have settled down in the Qing Village and married a girl, choosing to never leave the village.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When a person had great strength, his ambition would be greater!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he could not cultivate, the girls around him would not even give him a second look, what more entering the fast-paced world of the Central Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could only glean from his thoughts the realization that the women in his proximity were his muse. As long as there was even a tiny thread of a feeling, he would not let go of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like a year ago, when he spoke with the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, for him to give up the other girls and marry only her, he was not able to. Regardless, Qing Shui would not take the initiative to abandon the women who had bonds with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Besides, Qing Shui did not believe that the Misty Hall Palace Mistress would really marry him. She said that to prove that he did not have the ability to do everything she wanted him to do.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui felt that this woman had a deep understanding of him…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, not knowing what kind of man would be worthy of her. Even Hai Long of the Hai Clan was not despite being handsome and one of the top cultivators of his generation, to the point where he believed that no one could defeat him. Qing Shui had actually long surpassed him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, Hai Long was too young. Qing Shui felt he lacked tolerance, or perhaps the lack of a mature air. Someone who would be worthy of her would not be the most handsome man, but someone with wisdom or a straightforward personality, someone who could soar towards the heavens and pierce through the clouds……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: The flowery words at the end of the last paragraph, meant someone with great abilities, I thought it sounded poetic]</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her man would definitely be a capable man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know if his thoughts were right, but he felt that her future partner would definitely stand out from the crowd.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After arriving at the now-cold Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, he slowly opened it. A hint of a familiar and thick fragrance wafted out, the furnace filled this time with 15 Beast Pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, my ability to refine medicinal pills have increased again!” Qing Shui picked up the pills as he laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Including the previous year, his experience in refining pills had already reached 800 thousand. The Alchemic Recipe for the Everlasting Pellet would be revealed soon, so Qing Shui felt full of hope.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">1 million points of experience; just based on the amount of experience needed, he knew the Everlasting Pellet would be extraordinary.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Beast Pill could raise the strength of demonic beast by 10%, and every demonic beast could eat a maximum of 5 pills, had a 1% chance of the Blood Awakening and in the same vein comprehending an innate martial skill.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the advantages of a demonic beast were much higher than a human’s. Not only was their bodily strength superb, the effects of their core would be much stronger. At least 3 humans of the same grade would be needed to combat a demonic beast on an equal level.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the effects of consuming Gifted Earth Treasures were better, just like the Beast Pill that Qing Shui had previously refined. It was obviously the same grade as the Small Revitalizing Pellet, but yet the disparity in potency was at the very least double.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he thought about the time when the Fire Bird ate the Beast Pill, he decided to refined more Beast Pills, determined for the Diamond Demonic Boar to awaken its innate talents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he thought about the Stonegold Rabbit King, Qing Shui was prepared to give Huoyun Liu-Li some Beast Pills. This thing, which was favored by heaven and earth, should have some extraordinary latent power.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cultivating, Talisman Drawing, refining medicine…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although boring, Qing Shui had high hopes that there would be high returns. Thus, he was quite happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The growth of the Diamond Demonic Boar led Qing Shui to feel very fortunate. If the almost level 3 Martial King beast could advance again, then it would live up to the word demon and diamond in its name.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Superior growth and exaggerated defense!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart brightened up as a result. Although the road ahead was bumpy, it was equally filled with numerous opportunities. It was just a matter of whether he can grasp them or not.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without using any weapon, or any external strength, Qing Shui had achieved a little more than the strength of 2 countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, if he executed the Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The strength of 5 countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared blankly. His own body had already reached the strength of 1 country,so &nbsp;this one stomp would be devastating. Qing Shui wanted to give it a try, but he gave up on this tempting idea.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then caused the surging energy in his body to settle. After his mental state had slowly calmed down, Qing Shui looked into his dantian, at the Upper Dantian he had cultivated for a year.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Inner vision!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His vision revealed the area around the Tianfu acupoint as a ball of misty clouds gradually converging into one. It was different from the cultivation of the Lower Dantian; the Upper Dantian would become a Heavenly Dan once successfully cultivated, containing a great strength built upon the foundations of the Lower Dantian.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: 天府 - Tianfu acupoint is located on the right arm about 3 inches below the level of the heart, about the level of where the Upper Dantian is in this novel.]</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confident that he could cultivate the Heavenly Dan, because the cloud in his Upper Dantian was getting denser and had earlier became a thick paste. Now, the coagulation speed could be seen with the naked eye.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time slowly passed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui swallowed the Sixfold Spirit Concentrating Pill and greatly increased his cultivating speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hey! I’m almost there!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly opened his eyes. Condensing the Heavenly Dan had failed at the final step. While he was certain he could succeed in one more try, it sadly had to wait for the next morrow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui ceased his cultivation of the Heavenly Dan, deciding to refine the Beast Pill first. He wanted to raise the strength of the Diamond Demonic Boar once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the 1 year, the Diamond Demonic Boar had spent a lot of time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Its food comprised the black fish, turtles, and crabs that were rich in Spiritual Qi.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui could not stay in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for a long time, the Fire Bird and the Diamond Demonic Boar, as well as the creatures in the pond, could indefinitely remain inside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Refining the Beast Pills could have been done a year ago, as he had the ingredients ready then. But now, the quality of the ingredients were even better. Furthermore, Qing Shui had seen some improvement in regards to cultivating medicinal pills. Although he could not create new pills, he could add in some attributes or a supporting ingredient with matching elements, causing the effect of the pill to be better.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For example, in this Beast pill, Qing Shui added some Demonic beast's core, which was even a 3000 Year Demonic beast's core, as well as blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle, and the pearl powder from an oyster whose age exceed 1000.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During this year, after his strength had increased, Qing Shui realized that his primordial flames had undergone some changes. The size remained unchanged, but the color had attained a more gentle nuance, shifting hue to a pure gray color of equal amounts white and black.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not encounter much pressure refining the Beast Pill this time, for he had sufficient ingredients. Unlike when he attempted the Great Revitalizing Pellet, the ingredients had been prepared beforehand this time. The Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass had matured, but Qing Shui had unsuccessfully tried three times already. He had, however, harvested the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass multiple times.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the refinement of the first batch succeeded, Qing Shui went to have some food in the interim as the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron was cooling down.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While eating, Qing Shui’s state of mind wandered. The epiphany struck him – he no longer knew what he was living for. At first, it was for the sake of revenge. And in order to remove the burden from himself. But now Qing Shui was worried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Because once he cast away this burden, he had no other goals to chase after. Qing Shui did not have any great ambitions. He had neither thought about leaving a legend in the Central continent nor wanted to be an overlord.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s previously frantic cultivation was all for survival, so that he could live better without having to worry about others, to live with a sense of safety.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If there was no grudge with the Yan Clan, Qing Shui might have settled down in the Qing Village and married a girl, choosing to never leave the village.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When a person had great strength, his ambition would be greater!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he could not cultivate, the girls around him would not even give him a second look, what more entering the fast-paced world of the Central Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could only glean from his thoughts the realization that the women in his proximity were his muse. As long as there was even a tiny thread of a feeling, he would not let go of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like a year ago, when he spoke with the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, for him to give up the other girls and marry only her, he was not able to. Regardless, Qing Shui would not take the initiative to abandon the women who had bonds with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Besides, Qing Shui did not believe that the Misty Hall Palace Mistress would really marry him. She said that to prove that he did not have the ability to do everything she wanted him to do.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui felt that this woman had a deep understanding of him…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly, not knowing what kind of man would be worthy of her. Even Hai Long of the Hai Clan was not despite being handsome and one of the top cultivators of his generation, to the point where he believed that no one could defeat him. Qing Shui had actually long surpassed him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, Hai Long was too young. Qing Shui felt he lacked tolerance, or perhaps the lack of a mature air. Someone who would be worthy of her would not be the most handsome man, but someone with wisdom or a straightforward personality, someone who could soar towards the heavens and pierce through the clouds……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: The flowery words at the end of the last paragraph, meant someone with great abilities, I thought it sounded poetic]</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her man would definitely be a capable man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know if his thoughts were right, but he felt that her future partner would definitely stand out from the crowd.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After arriving at the now-cold Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, he slowly opened it. A hint of a familiar and thick fragrance wafted out, the furnace filled this time with 15 Beast Pills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, my ability to refine medicinal pills have increased again!” Qing Shui picked up the pills as he laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Including the previous year, his experience in refining pills had already reached 800 thousand. The Alchemic Recipe for the Everlasting Pellet would be revealed soon, so Qing Shui felt full of hope.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">1 million points of experience; just based on the amount of experience needed, he knew the Everlasting Pellet would be extraordinary.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Beast Pill could raise the strength of demonic beast by 10%, and every demonic beast could eat a maximum of 5 pills, had a 1% chance of the Blood Awakening and in the same vein comprehending an innate martial skill.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that the advantages of a demonic beast were much higher than a human’s. Not only was their bodily strength superb, the effects of their core would be much stronger. At least 3 humans of the same grade would be needed to combat a demonic beast on an equal level.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the effects of consuming Gifted Earth Treasures were better, just like the Beast Pill that Qing Shui had previously refined. It was obviously the same grade as the Small Revitalizing Pellet, but yet the disparity in potency was at the very least double.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he thought about the time when the Fire Bird ate the Beast Pill, he decided to refined more Beast Pills, determined for the Diamond Demonic Boar to awaken its innate talents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he thought about the Stonegold Rabbit King, Qing Shui was prepared to give Huoyun Liu-Li some Beast Pills. This thing, which was favored by heaven and earth, should have some extraordinary latent power.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cultivating, Talisman Drawing, refining medicine…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although boring, Qing Shui had high hopes that there would be high returns. Thus, he was quite happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The growth of the Diamond Demonic Boar led Qing Shui to feel very fortunate. If the almost level 3 Martial King beast could advance again, then it would live up to the word demon and diamond in its name.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Superior growth and exaggerated defense!</p>
