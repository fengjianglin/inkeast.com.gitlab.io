 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This breakthrough was a great qualitative leap for Qing Shui. It could be said to be a mini progressive leap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui came out the next day, he experienced a change to his mental state when he looked at everything around him. The bring sun shone down on the earth, sending myriad streams of golden light scattering down. Qing Shui stood in the courtyard, moving slowly under the golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After coming out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, his strength had been suppressed to be at the Cave Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Huang walked out and directly broke into a warm smile when she saw Qing Shui. She still wore her phoenix dress and had an indescribable air of poise and dignity. She had a great figure—not to mention her otherworldly beauty—and when she was standing there, she was like the most beautiful scenery in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui went up next to her. He couldn’t help but hug and kiss her passionately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it hadn't been long since they last made love, he still felt extremely attracted by her beauty, resulting in the undying flame of urge toward her. Qing Shui's tongue darted deep into Shen Huang's mouth with attitude, greedily sucking her saliva. His hands that were around her slender waist also fell onto her well-rounded butt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He grabbed her butt with one of his hands, not slacking off with the other. His hand exuded a demonic charm to it, causing Shen Huang's body to twist about as she replied to Qing Shui's kiss with fervor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan walked out and looked at the two of them from a distance away. Qing Shui knew that Beihuang Fan was looking at him. Her expression was still gentle and calm as she wore a faint smile. Qing Shui led Shen Huang up to Beihuang Fan, having one of his hands around her slender waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Huang pushed Qing Shui away shyly, and their lips parted, dragging a stream of silvery thread that didn't break. This made Shen Huang's face flush up even more. Qing Shui trailed onto this silvery thread all the way to her lips and then sucked on them before releasing her with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Huang pushed Qing Shui away. "I'll go and prepare breakfast."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan smiled and looked at Qing Shui. She didn't feel embarrassed. Although the three of them hadn't slept on the same bed together, it wasn't the first time they kissed each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui hugged Beihuang Fan and kissed her thoroughly before saying, "It's been so long but neither of you have gotten pregnant. It seems that it won't be easy if we wish to have children in the future."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Qing Shui's words, Beihuang Fan was stunned. She then smiled. "Let nature take its course. Some things can't be forced."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you like children?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We haven't settled down, and I don't have a strong feeling toward this. Maybe I'll want to have one in the future," Beihuang Fan gave it some thought before replying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We still have a lot of time before us. In the future, we'll do it every day. I don't believe that you won't get pregnant." Qing Shui looked at Beihuang Fan and smiled suggestively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan turned around, not daring to face Qing Shui directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard that there are a few positions which make it easier to get one pregnant," Qing Shui said in a soft voice toward Beihuang Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What positions?" Beihuang Fan asked shyly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui lifted up her exquisite chin and said something in a similar tone. Beihuang Fan's face flushed up even more, and her charming appearance almost made Qing Shui bring her back to put his words into practice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, Qing Shui announced a piece of news to everyone—prepare to head to the Upper Three Regions in three days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one was surprised by this news. In fact, they had all thought that they should have left half a year ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people progressed at a rapid rate. After all, Qing Shui had helped them with his medicinal pills, medical skills, and other means. Everyone was basically able to receive Qing Shui's care individually. He had helped them with the impurities cleansing and used the power of the Shield Attack to help them break through their barriers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst these people, the Massacre Battle God progressed the fastest. Moreover, he had nine caves, and this was already considered very terrifying. One would require a great fortunate encounter to be able to attain ten caves. Ordinary geniuses would only have eight or nine caves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan also had nine caves, but there seemed to be the sight of her tenth cave. However, this had gone on for half a year. Therefore, Qing Shui didn't rush her to break through to the Nurture God Realm. He got her to attempt opening the tenth cave first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there wasn't any sight of the tenth cave, then the chances wouldn't be high. However, if there were hints of the tenth cave in sight, it was possible to open up the tenth cave in principle. However, there were people who could see the shadows of their tenth cave but were unable to open the tenth cave despite working hard for their entire lifetimes. This showed how difficult the conditions were to attain the tenth cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three days later, Qing Shui and the others left, leaving the manor to the old woman and the little boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little boy was very hardworking. Qing Shui had helped him to establish his foundations. Back then, he thought that he would only be able to teach him for three months. He hadn't expected to be staying here for close to two years. During this time, Qing Shui had taken the boy in as his disciple. It wasn't for any other reason but for his safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had taken the boy in as his disciple, quite a number of major forces in the Forsaken Heaven City came. Qing Shui even gifted a Black Ice Divine Worm to the little boy and got him to go through the owner recognition process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Qing Shui had the ability to do this. In the past, if the difference in strength was too wide, the chances of failing the process would be high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Forsaken Heaven City's City Lord didn't appear. Qing Shui didn't think about getting to know him either. How could a person who was able to become the Forsaken Heaven City's City Lord be a simple character? The person should be aware of everything he had done here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as Qing Shui and the others were about to leave, something happened which caused Qing Shui to frown uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't be in a hurry to leave. Have you forgotten about me so quickly?" A group of people arrived. The person in the lead was a young, handsome man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Qing Shui didn't know this guy, he saw a hint of familiarity from him. This man bore a resemblance to someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Peach Blossom City's City Lord. He bore a resemblance to the Peach Blossom City's City Lord whom Qing Shui had killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui remembered very clearly that the Peach Blossom City was amongst the top ten cities in the Forsaken Heaven Region. Most importantly, the Peach Blossom City's City Lord had said that his father was the dominator of the Forsaken Heaven Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dominator. It was a person whose strength far surpassed that of ordinary forces in this region. This was also a unique ability that the dominator had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui now understood why the City Lord's people hadn’t appeared all this while. If there weren’t any misunderstandings, the City Lord Manor should be where the Forsaken Heaven Region's dominator was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was stunned for a moment by this thought that rose up in his head. He wasn't very worried about the Forsaken Heaven Region's dominator right now. Even if that person was the dominator, he had the confidence to fight against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do we know each other?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you know Peach Blossom City's City Lord?" The man smiled with a greater sense of amusement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man's appearance caused many people from major forces to call out respectfully. "Young Master!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man didn't even throw them a glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I have heard of the Peach Blossom City's City Lord before. That moron even wanted to launch a sneak attack on me and rob me. I can't really remember whether I gave him a beating or killed him," Qing Shui thought seriously before saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's words caused many people present to gasp. That person was the child of the Forsaken Heaven Region's dominator. To have killed him... Was he courting death?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man's countenance was extremely grim. After all, his elder brother was being scolded, and this was no different than being scolded himself. He wasn't sad over his brother's death, as this was beneficial to him after all. However, he still had to put up a front for some things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My brother's dead. It’s said that there is a mark that indicates you as his killer. You've led a carefree life for so long that it's about time for you to pay with your life." The young man gave him a chilling gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"With the likes of you? I can actually kill you instantly. Do you believe me?" Qing Shui continued to counter with his smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Young man, you speak with such boldness. It's true that you can instantly kill this son of mine, but you won't have the chance to do so." A graceful and imposing voice rang out from the distance. It sounded as if it came from afar, but after saying this, he was already not far away from Qing Shui.</span></p>
