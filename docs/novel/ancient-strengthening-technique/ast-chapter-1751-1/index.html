 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when Qing Shui heard the Ocean Demon Palace being mentioned, he also started getting serious. The ten Ocean Demons who went on treasure-hunting with them were all dead. However, the time for the treasure-hunt was yet to be over. Hence, logically speaking, the Ocean Demon Palace shouldn’t be aware that they have all died for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless they had some sort of unique telepathic ability. But now, many things were still left unknown. Qing Shui was eager to see the reason for the appearance of Ocean Demon Palace this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For what? Some say that it’s for a treasure, some say that it’s for the area around the Northern Yang Ocean Domain. But apparently, a more accurate source says that it’s for a woman.” The middle-aged man seemingly lowered down his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Woman? What sort of a woman is she for the Ocean Demon Palace and Northern Yang Palace to fight so hard for?” Old Xiong said in a confused tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, the Northern Yang Palace Lord married a woman. But at the same time, the Ocean Demon Palace Lord also admired the same woman. Hence, he demanded the Northern Yang Palace Lord to hand her over. The Ocean Demon Palace didn’t expect Northern Yang Palace to go against their will because of how powerful they were. But to their surprises, Northern Yang Palace slaughtered the Ocean Demon Palace”s representative without any hesitation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They deserved it. They think that they can do whatever they want just because they are strong. Do they seriously think that the Northern Yang Palace is an easy target, who they can mess with?” Old Xiong seemed unusually happy as he was saying all of these.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was also stunned and looked at Muyun Qingge, “What kind of a woman is she to be able to start a war between two parties?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong? Could it be that you plan to get yourself involved in this too?” Muyun Qingge gave Qing Shui a curious look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui got speechless and looked back at her, “If I had really wanted to get myself involved, I wouldn’t have gotten so far away from it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was momentarily stunned by what he said. She blushed as she seemingly thought about something. She then lowered down her head and remained silent. Even she wasn’t sure why she said it herself. As she started pondering over it, she began to realize that she actually felt quite relaxed when she was around this man. It’s a feeling which words couldn’t describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, she began to not understand why she would feel like this. Could it have something to do with the fact that he has seen her naked before? It seemed like she didn’t really hate him too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before she started to ponder over it, she didn’t really see it as much of an issue. But now, as she thought deeper, she began to feel nervous. She felt a bit conflicted. She couldn’t help but started to think that Luo Qingcheng also showed interest in this man. And also Qing Hanye……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single one of these women was beautiful women which descended from the heaven, and yet, they all liked the same man. She slowly lifted up her head and once again examined the man whom she thought should more or less be considered mature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for his look, he should be quite decent. No sign of arrogance, nor impatience. He would occasionally act seriously, he also really spoilt his women. He was a good man, and he was also capable…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I good looking?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Muyun Qingge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She blushed when she noticed that she was seen by Qing Shui and shot a glare at him, “No!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The humble woman still possessed a very good look. Qing Shui examined her. Her flawless face, slender body, snow white neck, extending its way down to her legs… Her upright bosom that pushed the clothes around her chest all the way out….. Qing Shui couldn’t help but started getting a bit fired up looking at all of these……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There had been such a flawless woman by his side all these years, yet he didn’t make any moves until now. As he thought about this, he couldn’t help but admire himself for what he did.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The opposing side didn’t exactly say that it’s for the woman, nor did it concern Qing Shui, after all, whatever the reason was, it still wasn’t his business. The true issue Qing Shui was concerned of was who exactly would emerge victorious among these two sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s current strength was very fearsome. Adding it on with the upgrade of the Yin-Yang Image, he was no longer that worried about Ocean Demon Palace. But deep down, he still held a grudge against them, particularly the branch led by Yan Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After receiving some news from the locals, they found out that the Lord of Ocean Demon Palace who planned to snatch away the Northern Yang Palace Lord’s woman was a person of Yan Clan. He was likely the father of Yan Ziyun, Yan Yujiang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui who found out about this didn’t express much interest. He planned to continue on his journey after resting for a while. For now, most importantly, they must head off for Sacred Ocean Sound Cave. As for the dispute between the two factions, it had nothing to do with him. Certainly, deep down, he would still hope for the Northern Yang Palace to win, because of Yan Ziyun, Qing Shui didn’t have many good feelings about the Ocean Demon Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, shall we go and take a look at the situation?” Muyun Qingge said while eating something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget about it. It doesn’t have anything to do with us. Let’s go after a short while.” Qing Shui took up the bowl and took the last sip of the soup before it finished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge nodded. Very quickly, the two finished and left. Though no major news was heard, it could be felt that the Ocean Demon Palace possessed a bad reputation. Furthermore, it seemed that Northern Yang Palace also didn’t fear them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enemy of an enemy is a friend. Hence, Qing Shui planned to communicate more with the Northern Yang Palace next time when he was free. It would be great if they could face off against the Ocean Demons together. At the moment, Qing Shui felt that the Northern Yang Palace was a bit weaker than the Ocean Demon Palace, merely the branch led by the Yan Clan wasn’t something easy to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge rode the White Jade Dragon and left immediately. They were flying at a very high speed. They only managed to look at the scenery below briefly before it disappeared right away. After fifteen minutes, Qing Shui suddenly lifted his head and looked into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, Muyun Qingge also looked in that direction, the reason was that far away in the distance actually stood around ten warriors. They seemed to be waiting for something. Very soon, Qing Shui could already see them clearly. They were the Ocean Demon Tribes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were about ten Ocean Demons. Qing Shui then started wondering why they were here and came to assume that they might be here to wait for the Northern Yang Palace Lord. Prior to this, he has heard rumors that they wanted to battle. Qing Shui then smiled at Muyun Qingge, “Let’s go and try not to seek trouble with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is that! Halt your steps!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Shui and the White Jade Dragon slightly moved a bit higher with the intention of passing over them from above. However, to his surprise, before they even managed to do it, the people already began screaming at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui got a bit upset. Though he didn’t want to seek troubles, the opponents actually went on to do it instead. They must have been really free or they might also be in a bad mood. Could it be because he tried to fly over them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do?” Muyun Qingge asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s alright. Let’s see what they want from us first.” Qing Shui responded. After that, he slowly came to a halt and proceeded to look into the opposite side.</span></p>

He looked very handsome. Soon after, Qing Shui noticed that he looked similar to Yan Ziyun, the only difference was that the man in front of him right now looked slightly more mature. He had more charisma and also a pair of clear yet profound eyes. He was equipped with the charms which a man was supposed to have.&nbsp;</span></p>

They indeed didn’t stain their name as Demonic Tribes… Compared to the transsexual from his previous incarnation, they looked a lot better.</span></p>

He voiced out and questioned them.&nbsp;</span></p>

Instead, he moved his sight to Muyun Qingge. A greedy look flashed across his eyes. Qing Shui has been keeping an eye on him. He couldn’t help but sigh. Just as the saying went, “Like father, like son”. The son died for a woman, and then similarly, the father also started bluffing himself. Furthermore, it was precisely the same woman that his son looked up to.&nbsp;</span></p>

Why didn’t you take a turn when you saw us, but instead choose to fly over us?” The man only looked at Qing Shui now and asked in a discontent tone.&nbsp;</span></p>

Warriors wouldn’t lose their pride even if they were weaker than their opponents in strength. Before it was determined which sides were stronger, warriors wouldn’t want to take an alternate route nor fly below the opponents as it would be considered an insult to themselves. Qing Shui only came to remember now that he only thought that he needed to fly above them, but forgotten that they would also be reluctant to &nbsp;see him just fly past them from above.&nbsp;</span></p>
