  <p><strong>AST 0125 – The Arena at the Wedding Banquet (2)</strong></p>
  <p>Time passed by very quickly. Unknowingly, there was soon only 3 days left before Qing Zi’s wedding!</p>
  <p>The decor of the nuptial room was already completed. Feng Clan also had trading shops in Hundred Miles City. When he first heard of the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store and the Feng Clan’s Trading Store, he had imagined them to be very large scale. Only after he had come to Hundred Miles City did he realize that the trading stores and medicinal stores of their size could only be considered to be slightly bigger than normal stores.</p>
  <p>That day, Qing Luo, Qing Jiang and Qing He had all arrived at Hundred Miles City. After all, it was a huge affair for them. Qing He had not wanted to go initially, but Qing Luo eventually persuaded Qing He to go. It would only take them a few days.</p>
  <p>“Grandpa, you really know how to sit back and enjoy life. Just one word, and the work was all dumped on me. If you wanted to, you should have just delegated the task to uncle and the rest.” Qing Shui smiled after seeing Qing Luo.</p>
  <p>Qing Jiang and Qing He also smiled and looked at Qing Shui. The friendly smile made Qing Shui feel very happy, it was worth it even if it was tiring!</p>
  <p>“Haha, this old man is still good at viewing people. You will be the one who has the best future in Qing Clan. Qing Shui, although you are child of my daughter, I see you no differently than the children of my sons.” Qing Luo reached out his hand and pat Qing Shui on the head amiably as he spoke.</p>
  <p>“Grandpa, no matter what, I will still be a member of the Qing Clan!” Qing Shui smiled and said in a straightforward manner. His smile was very pure, and one who saw it would feel at ease.</p>
  <p>“This time around, I must have my fill of that black fish. Your 3rd uncle brought some back the other time. After trying it, the fish and meat that we used to enjoy seemed to turn tasteless.” After meeting Qing Shui, the smile on Qing Luo’s face never changed.</p>
  <p>“Haha, grandpa can have all you want. Now, there’s even the turtle which is tastier than the black fish. They are both reared in the pond over there. Later, we’ll cook up a feast for you to enjoy and have a good meal.” Qing Shui and company chatted happily next to the water, and entered the lounge after taking a look at the pond!</p>
  <p>In the lounge, everyone in the Qing Clan had gathered. There were barely enough numbers, and their abilities weren’t any better. There was no Xiantian cultivators amongst them. Of course, Qing Shui was the exception.</p>
  <p>“On that day, Qing He, Qing Shui and Qing You will go to the Feng Clan’s Trading Store to receive the bride; Qing Jiang, Qing Hu, and Qing Hai will remain at home to entertain the guests. After everyone is back, Qing He will take charge of the arena. Mmm, Qing Shui, you as well.” Qing Luo stroked his brows as he spoke.</p>
  <p>Qing Luo continued to give out several instructions, all of which were the nitty gritty stuff like traditions, which were very important. Only then did Qing Shui realize how troublesome a wedding was.</p>
  <p>“You guys discuss and think of what to use as the wedding chariot, I’ll go and meet a few old friends.” Qing Luo finished his words and headed out. The rest saw him to the door.</p>
  <p>“In the end, after discussion, it was decided that we will be using a normal horse chariot, but the decorations must be as lavish and as luxurious as possible!”</p>
  <p>The wedding banquet will be held at Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. Afterall, the space there was wide enough, and the arena was constructed within the grounds of the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. It was customary that the arena could not be too far away from the banquet.</p>
  <p>Two days later, they confirmed the route that they would be taking. The route they needed to take would be a circular route, without crossing the same path twice, nor could they head back the same route. It represented that the newly wedded couple would have a perfect life which only looked forward.</p>
  <p>In the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store! Qing Shui, Qing Zi, Qing Yang, Qing Shan…almost everyone from the 3 generations of the Qing Clan were present to have a drink tonight. The big affair was on the following day, that was why they decided to have a lively gathering!</p>
  <p>“Brother Zi, are you happy?” Qing Shan grinned and asked.</p>
  <p>“I am happy. In the future, your brother will have someone to warm his bed.” Qing Zi’s big build, coupled with his straightforward laughter made those who saw him felt like laughing.</p>
  <p>“Oh dear God, please bless me with a beauty. I also want to get married.” Qing Shan called out exaggeratedly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shan’s plea led to a series of laughter!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at Qing Shan as he smiled and said, “Actually, if you don’t always think about finding a beauty, you would realize that you’re surrounded by so many beauties that you’re spoiled for choices.”</p>
  <p>“You think everyone is like you? What unknowingly surrounded by so many beauties to be spoiled for choice. You already have a woman who is beautiful like a fairy. Mmm, and likely one in the dark too, in addition, you also have a beauty hidden in a house. You are what they typically call, ‘a man who is full knows not the hunger of one who is famished’.” Qing Shan said in grief.</p>
  <p>“Cough cough!” Qing Shui had wanted to justify himself, but ended up only coughing two times, causing everyone else to break into a laughter.</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Shui, I heard from Qing Shan that that fairy is a Xiantian cultivator. How about you give us some secret tips on how to chase Xiantian beauties? If I’m also able to chase three Xiantian beauties for myself, tsk tsk, who would I be scared of then? At night I will drown in ecstasy, and in the day they could be my bodyguards. My life would be free and easy!”</p>
  <p>Qing You’s words made Qing Shui speechless. This chap was too matured, to think that he even had such a big appetite. He could not help but ask, “Qing You, why just three women, and not one or two or even more?”</p>
  <p>“The importance of women is their quality and not quantity! For example, Brother Qing Shui, it is already sufficient for you to have a beauty who is like a fairy!”</p>
  <p>“If that’s the case, why would you still need three?” Qing Shui asked, puzzled. The others were puzzled too. Afterall, the words which he had spoken seemed to contradict itself.</p>
  <p>“I had originally thought of looking for one as well, but after putting some thoughts into it, I realized that that it is hard to be able to vie for top quality women. The stronger the woman, the higher their expectations. Since that’s the case, I will choose to take quantity over quality. But, too many would cause me to die of exhaustion, so after thinking it over for three days, I decided to marry three!” Qing You said very seriously.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He did not expect that this Qing You, who had a big build who was always naive and simple-minded, also had a joking and lewd side. The atmosphere turned livelier than ever.</p>
  <p>Unknowingly, Qing Shui drank till it was time for him to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The others had also had their fill, so they each took a final cup of wine and went back to their respective rooms.</p>
  <p>The next day, everyone in the Qing Clan woke up very early. The chariots were ready, as were the firecrackers and fireworks. There were also scrolls and such hung up.</p>
  <p>Qing He led Qing Zi, Qing Shui and the company they had enlisted help from, with the lavishly decorated chariots forming a trail as if they were a dragon, as they headed slowly for the direction of the Feng Clan’s Trading Store.</p>
  <p>The distance was not very far, and they managed to reach it within an hour. Thereafter, Qing Zi carried the bride onto the chariot. The scene was very lively. They then headed back for the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store on a route that was slightly further since they were required to travel in a loop. When they arrived at the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store, it was only late in the morning.</p>
  <p>Many guests progressively arrived. Regardless, it was still required to show some courtesy. Moreover, Qing Clan’s status was very mysterious. After the event with the Heavenly River City’s Gongyang Clan the other time, Qing Clan’s status had turned very mysterious.</p>
  <p>Qing Luo and Qing Jiang first toasted the Feng Clan, and Qing Shui once again met the mature lady Feng Wuxi. She had not changed. The charming face did not reveal any traces of her age, merely endless charm. All the upper class ladies from Hundred Miles City could not compare to her.</p>
  <p>She stood there, emitting a silent aura. It was not exceptional aura, but was one of calm. Her perfect full-bodied figure had an aura that was the direct opposite of youthfulness. It was a mature feeling. She was a lady with with grace, a woman who was beautiful and sexy, a real woman.</p>
  <p>She gave a charming smile upon seeing Qing Shui, causing his heart to turn numb as he secretly envied the man who could hold her at night and do as he wished. She was a not a lady of overwhelming beauty that one would give up a country or city for. However, she was a lady whom one would be willing to die in the arms of.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled at Feng Wuxi and said, “Hello Aunt Xi!”</p>
  <p>Feng Wuxi smiled gently, “Qing Shui, you’ve grown up and become more mature!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned! He thought, “She is seducing me, hinting at me!” Just when he had wanted to give a polite reply, his eyes caught sight of the scene on the arena. Qing Hu, who had been on the arena this whole time, was receiving his first opponent!</p>

 <p>Qing He led Qing Zi, Qing Shui and the company they had enlisted help from, with the lavishly decorated chariots forming a trail as if they were a dragon, as they headed slowly for the direction of the Feng Clan’s Trading Store.</p>
 <p>The distance was not very far, and they managed to reach it within an hour. Thereafter, Qing Zi carried the bride onto the chariot. The scene was very lively. They then headed back for the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store on a route that was slightly further since they were required to travel in a loop. When they arrived at the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store, it was only late in the morning.</p>
 <p>Many guests progressively arrived. Regardless, it was still required to show some courtesy. Moreover, Qing Clan’s status was very mysterious. After the event with the Heavenly River City’s Gongyang Clan the other time, Qing Clan’s status had turned very mysterious.</p>
 <p>Qing Luo and Qing Jiang first toasted the Feng Clan, and Qing Shui once again met the mature lady Feng Wuxi. She had not changed. The charming face did not reveal any traces of her age, merely endless charm. All the upper class ladies from Hundred Miles City could not compare to her.</p>
 <p>She stood there, emitting a silent aura. It was not exceptional aura, but was one of calm. Her perfect full-bodied figure had an aura that was the direct opposite of youthfulness. It was a mature feeling. She was a lady with with grace, a woman who was beautiful and sexy, a real woman.</p>
 <p>She gave a charming smile upon seeing Qing Shui, causing his heart to turn numb as he secretly envied the man who could hold her at night and do as he wished. She was a not a lady of overwhelming beauty that one would give up a country or city for. However, she was a lady whom one would be willing to die in the arms of.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled at Feng Wuxi and said, “Hello Aunt Xi!”</p>
 <p>Feng Wuxi smiled gently, “Qing Shui, you’ve grown up and become more mature!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned! He thought, “She is seducing me, hinting at me!” Just when he had wanted to give a polite reply, his eyes caught sight of the scene on the arena. Qing Hu, who had been on the arena this whole time, was receiving his first opponent!</p>
