She was able to make her own prescriptions. With Qing Shui’s current medical experience, he could only create some simple prescriptions. On the other hand, Yuan Su was able to create the formidable ones. Other than that, she also knew how to repair some of the crippled medical prescriptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, when she said that she had completed the ancient medical prescriptions, she actually meant these two pieces of crippled ancient medical prescriptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The normal prescriptions would usually include its own name, but this wasn’t important. Another thing the prescription should record was its functions. In other words, its effect since this was very important. Other than these two things, the prescription would also record the overall materials needed to make the medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, the crippled prescriptions were divided into two types. The first type was those which contained the function of the medicine, but had an incomplete list of the materials needed to prepare the medicine. The person trying to complete it would have to figure out the materials that were left out by looking through its function.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other type was one which contained neither its name nor function, but only its materials. In this scenario, the pills were able to be made. The person would then have to figure out what pill it was by observing its effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a third one, which was the hardest one to complete. It recorded only an incomplete list of materials and nothing else. This was the toughest prescription to complete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was observing the two prescriptions that were in Yuan Su’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he took over and looked, Qing Shui froze in shock. The first one was the Martial Emperor Golden Pellet. When he looked at its function, it could turn the person who took it immediately into a Martial Emperor grade warrior. As to what realm of Martial Emperor grade, this would depend on the strength of its consumer. It was required for the consumer’s strength to be below the Martial Emperor Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon taking the Martial Emperor Golden Pellet, speaking of it in general, the warrior would halt their progress at the Martial Emperor realm. With normal cultivations, it would be very difficult for them to advance any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew about this. Back then, when he was refining the Xiantian Golden Pellet, things were also like this. Nevertheless, nothing was absolute in this world. Qing Shui didn’t know if there would be such a thing as the Martial Saint Golden Pellet. He felt that it was a faraway goal since the current Martial Emperor Golden Pellet was already quite difficult to be refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After looking at the ingredients for the Martial Emperor Golden Pellet, Qing Shui knew that even if he had the prescription for the Martial Saint Golden Pellet, it would be pointless. At this moment, he was already unable to collect all of the ingredients for the Martial Emperor Golden Pellet… Most importantly, there was one ingredient in particular which he hadn’t even heard before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Martial Emperor Origin Essence. Qing Shui didn’t know much about it nor did he know how he could get his hands on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Yuan Su whereas Yuan Su looked back at him and smiled. She knew that Qing Shui needed this prescription. To some aristocratic clans, this prescription would be totally worthless. They wouldn’t show much interest even if she handed over the prescription to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My beloved wife, what exactly is a Martial Emperor Origin Essence? Do you know anything about it?” As long as Qing Shui found the Martial Emperor Origin Essence, he would be able to refine the Martial Emperor Golden Pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su stunned from being called by him. She then blushed and said, “The Martial Emperor Origin Essence was Origin Essence Pills formed by the Martial Emperor grade Demonic Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s face immediately turned bitter. The prescription was indeed tricky, no matter what ingredients it lacked, it mustn’t lack the Martial Emperor Origin Essence. Other ingredients could be easily replaced, but not the Martial Emperor Origin Essence. It was the basis which formed the Martial Emperor Golden Pellet. Without it, even if Qing Shui was to successfully refine it, it would no longer be the Martial Emperor Golden Pellet anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su smiled when she saw Qing Shui’s face, “Don’t put up such a bitter face. Though the Martial Emperor Origin Essence might be hard to find, it’s not like it didn’t exist at all. There were some Martial Emperor grade demonic beasts that would form Origin Essence Pills like these. They are just very rare and come in small quantities. You can go to certain places and send words that you’re looking for it. Some people who hunted the Martial Emperor existences might have the Martial Emperor Origin Essence in their hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “You don’t have to rush for that. Take your time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he moved his sight onto the other prescription. Just like the one before, it was also a simple and unadorned Beast Skin Parchment. The pill had quite a decent name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Opportunity Pill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could also be described as a kind of pill which helped to unlock the stocks and chains across one’s body. To explain it using the modern terms: it helped to unlock one’s genes, or rather, to develop them. For example, once the human genes evolved, in the future, they might be able to carry things that were a hundred times their own weight like ants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Across the World of the Nine Continents, this kind of mutation would usually result in an individual which was more powerful than its predecessor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Opportunity Pill. Like it said, its effect depended solely on one’s luck. It was also similar to the Fate Pill. Upon taking it, there were many situations that could happen. For instance, one might not receive anything from it. In another case scenario, one might receive a slight boost in strength, or a slight boost in their innate talents and their body physiques, even their foundation might become more stable. Some might also break through their own realm as a result of taking in the pill, for example, they might break through from Xiantian Realm to the Martial Emperor Realm. Last but not least, some might receive significant boosts in their physiques, this meant their abilities such as their offensive prowess or defensive prowess might be multiplied by folds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Opportunity Pill relied greatly on one’s opportunity. In fact, there should only be a minority of people with great luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a good stuff, but it doesn’t seem like it can be refined that easily. Its ingredients are not easy to find.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have already found most of the ingredients for the Opportunity Pill. I was unable to track down some of them but those ingredients could be replaced with other stuff. Though it may slightly reduce the effect of the pills, there is no other way to refine them otherwise.” Yuan Su smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have always believed that my Su Su is the most capable one… Let us do it one more time…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su blushed and mumbled, “a filthy mouth can never utter a decent language……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But very quickly, she was already letting out delicate moans. Her eyes were half opened when she looked at Qing Shui. The soul-taking numbness along with the rich sensation made him feel as if his soul had flown out of his body. Though embarrassed, she was also very daring. She didn’t hold herself back from looking at the man who was torturing her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui however, turned his body around immediately and let Yuan Su sat on top of him. He then smiled, “Here, let me give you the chance to be a knight once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su who was unable to persuade Qing Shui embarrassingly sat on top of Qing Shui. Her beautiful eyes were half-squinted as she lowered her head, not daring to make direct eye contact with Qing Shui. After that, she gently moved her body and as she did so, the plumped mountains followed along and shook up and down. That scene was extremely appealing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time he woke up, the sky was already bright. Yuan Su gave Qing Shui the prescriptions and also a lot of ingredients. Despite her repeated attempts to produce the pills, she still failed. Seeing that there was hardly any chance of success, Yuan Su decided that it would be better to conserve the ingredients. The only thing to do now was for Qing Shui to attempt it. If even Qing Shui failed, it would only mean that there might be some problems with the prescription. Another possible reason could also be that they were not strong enough to refine the pills yet.</span></p>

His visit this time was in the name of a junior. It has nothing to do with any matters.</span></p>

However, They were now the biggest clan in the area. There was a time when a certain local clan wanted to bully the Zheng Clan, but in the end, things didn’t end well for them. After finding out the monstrous power of the Zheng Clan, no one had dared to provoke them ever since.</span></p>

Even if they were unable to enter the True Nine Continents World, it was not likely that they would act so humbly because of it. After all, with Zheng Clan’s strength, it somehow made them seem incompatible with this place.</span></p>
