 <p><strong>AST 731 - Kill, Golden Eagle, Hidden Room</strong></p>
 <p>The wounding power of the Hidden Weapons which Qing Shui released in a fit of rage was absolutely terrifying. Upon feeling the frightening power of the weapons, Zuoshi Long had no choice but to change his direction. But as he was about to charge in again, the frightening Frosted Iron Ball once again assaulted him.</p>
 <p>Aside from the previous Frosted Iron Ball which changed its trajectory, Qing Shui also tossed out another Frosted Iron Ball from his hand in the opposite direction to trap Zuoshi Long.</p>
 <p>Xiu-xiu.</p>
 <p>He shot out four Frosted Iron Balls all at once, this was the most Qing Shui could control for the time being. The four Frosted Iron Balls pushed Zuoshi Long back into a corner. No matter what he did, he wasn't able to avoid them. His strength has already been reduced significantly by Qing Shui, on top of being quite heavily injured from the previous blow, he was already very far behind Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Long immediately let two of the Frosted Iron Balls pierced through his shoulder and ribs as he clenched his teeth and attempted to once again charge towards the people from Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, he underestimated both the strength of the Frosted Iron Balls and Qing Shui’s speed. During this time, Qing Shui had long since arrived in front of Zhuoshi Long and stopped him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who swallowed the Gale Pellet and Agility-Enhancing Fruit had become way faster than Zuoshi Long in terms of speed. It might have been because of the difficulty in raising speed, they shared the smallest difference of ability in terms of speed. The effect of the Gale Pellet was still the same as before.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Long watched as Qing Shui stood in between himself and the people in Qing Clan. Despite the heavy injuries he was suffering from, he would still be able to at least cause heavy damages to the people in Qing Clan if he could manage to rush to them in his current condition. But now, the young man was already standing in his path. At that moment, he knew that all hope was gone.</p>
 <p>Ah!</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Long screamed out madly into the air. He swung the enormous blood-colored sword in his hand and once again charged towards Qing Shui. However, this time, he knew that this was his last move and he would be leaving this world.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sliced down on Zhuoshi Long with the technique ‘Mountain Splitting Strike’. The fierce attack immediately helped close the curtain of the battle, leaving only the enormous blood-colored sword.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Long died. Two of the four powerful people from Zuoshi Clan also suffered the same fate whereas the other two were heavily injured. The remaining people on the other hand, were feeble.</p>
 <p>The present Qing Shui was as bewitching as a demon. At least from the perspective of Zuoshi Clan’s remnants, he was an inconceivable evil genius. He was a young man who came from Green Cloud Continent but surprisingly, possessed such formidable power,</p>
 <p>The people from Qing Clan felt incomparably happy and relieved. Previously when Zhuoshi Long was charging towards them, it did make them feel scared. Sometimes, it's not death that they feared but the death of their loved ones.</p>
 <p>“Kill them! Only by killing them would we have a chance to survive!” Zuoshi Yun shouted out loudly to the people in his surroundings. He said it in a firm and unwavering tone.</p>
 <p>The others were also fully aware of the situation. It might have been because they knew that that they charged in towards Qing Shui together. If they didn’t kill this very young man from Qing Clan today, the only thing that awaited them would only be death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first stared at Zuoshi Yun. After that, he proceeded with his massacre like a tiger going into a flock of sheep. Zuoshi Yun gradually skywalked into the air and took a step towards Qing Shui. As he waved his hand, a golden eagle appeared in the air. The eagle was less than ten meters in size, but its appearance caused a change in Qing Shui’s expression and made him abandoned the others to charge towards Zhuoshi Yun.</p>
 <p>Golden Eagle!</p>
 <p>It was a speed type mutated beast and it possessed the unique ability to instantaneously evade attacks. In a fixed amount of time, it could teleport a distance as far as ten thousand meters. It was also incomparably fast in terms of speed. Even the present Fire bird was a bit inferior when it came to that.</p>
 <p>The Golden Eagle was a Demonic Beast which lived to avoid and assassinate people. Zuoshi Yun looked at Qing Shui and showed him a ruthless smile. After that, he disappeared in front of the crowd.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got really furious. He killed off the remaining people all at once and burnt them completely. After that, he looked into the direction where Zuoshi Yun disappeared into and turned blank.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui was planning to eradicate the Zuoshi Clan in three or four batches, but now, this was unlikely to happen. The next time Zuoshi Clan showed up, they would most probably come as an entire group. At least all of their experts would be here. Furthermore, Zuoshi Yun would definitely inform Zuoshi Clan about everything that happened here once he was back. This would cause them to pay particular attention to him. For a moment, Qing Shui had a headache as soon as he thought about facing twenty warriors with strength ranging from one star to three stars. He was clueless about what to do.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don't worry about it.” Canghai Mingyue said gently while carrying Qing Yin.</p>
 <p>With Qing Zun in her hand, Di Chen approached him along with the others from Qing Clan. Deep in their hearts, they understood that even though Qing Clan had become really powerful, they weren’t strong enough to take part in battles against even the weakest secluded clans. Other than Qing Shui, even the strongest person among them wasn't qualified to take part in the match.</p>
 <p>“I'm not worried, I'm thinking about when they will come here and give their lives away.” Qing Shui smiled as he took over Qing Yin from Canghai Mingyue’s hand. He also kissed her cheek.</p>
 <p>From the beginning, Qing Shui has never planned to let the two little brats stay here until he fixed this place to how it originally was. This time, another seven of Qing Clan’s pavilions were destroyed.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that Qing Shui’s words were only to comfort them. Nevertheless, they still showed him a happy smile. After all, the things that happened today were already considered to have ended. Today's battle was a total victory, the only unfortunate thing was that Zhuoshi Yun managed to escape in the end.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!” Qing Yin embraced Qing Shui’s neck and called out in a baby voice.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, what's wrong?” Qing Shui asked the little brat in his arm while walking towards his room.</p>
 <p>“I want to go and look at birds……”</p>
 <p>“Birds?” Qing Shui looked at the little brat in confusion.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I want to go and see……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was confused: “Little brat, where’s the bird?”</p>
 <p>“I don't know……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless, she didn't even know where it was. But Qing Shui could still look for some of his stuffs from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to play with her.</p>
 <p>At night!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui embraced Shi Qingzhuang and laid down on her bed. There were traces of redness on Shi Qingzhuang’s cold and beautiful face, giving a strong mental stimulation to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Her cold and shy face in particular, along with her enchanting and delicate moan stimulated Qing Shui to send her to the peak of happiness.</p>
 <p>After the two calmed down, they hugged each other tightly while listening to each other’s heartbeat. Shi Qingzhuang’s soft breasts were closely attached to Qing Shui’s chest and Qing Shui was infatuated with the comfortable feeling of them. Her snow white and upright posture revealed her arrogance.</p>
 <p>Her face had been red for a long time. There was also a light trace of water in her cold pupils, making it extremely alluring.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smelled the faint fragrance on her body and felt at peace. The incidents revolving around Zhuoshi Clan were like a big mountain which was pressing on Qing Shui to the point he couldn't breathe. Even now, it was still on his mind.</p>
 <p>“Don't worry about it. Didn't you say before? We have been through so much stuff, we are going to make it through this time as well.” Shi Qingzhuang said gently while raising her head to look at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Now, I couldn't manage to even look for a place for you guys to hide.” Qing Shui sighed and said gently. He didn't hide anything from Shi Qingzhuang because deep down, they knew what the situation was.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After two days, a rare guest showed up in Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>Elder Ge!</p>
 <p>“You’re here!” Qing Shui happily welcomed Elder Ge.</p>
 <p>This was already the third main hall. Compared to the first one, this one was slightly smaller.</p>
 <p>“Are you panicking over Zuoshi Clan?” Elder Ge said it straightforwardly as soon as he sat down.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's eyes flashed the moment he heard Elder Ge’s words. He glanced towards him; “do you have a great plan?”</p>
 <p>“No I don't, I only want to know if Qing Shui, you can beat Zuoshi Clan with your current strength?” Elder Ge looked at Qing Shui and said slowly.</p>
 <p>“At least it's worth a try. The chance of me winning is also quite high. However, I am worried about them” Qing Shui confessed his biggest worries.</p>
 <p>That day, Zuoshi Long actually made the decision to do something like that towards the end. Fortunately, he has been prepared for this kind of scenario, if not, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Even if he was to kill all of them, it wouldn't be able to help make up for his loss.</p>
 <p>“There is an extremely large secret room in Heavenly Palace. It can help to get rid of your worries. It's just that I want to know clearly how confident you are in winning. If not, even if they’re to enter the secret room, they’d only be able to live up to a year and a half.” Elder Ge looked at Qing Shui anxiously.</p>
 <p>“I am seventy percent confident that I can beat them!” Qing Shui said seriously after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, I won't say anything more. I will safely bring them to the secret room and leave everything here to you. I won’t carry on with the niceties, I won't be of any help here anyway.” Elder Ge said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about? Since you are able to help me get rid of my worries, I'm even more confident that I'll win. Is this secret room really reliable?” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I know you wouldn't believe me, I'll bring you to go and have a look later to help put your worries to rest. This was something that was left behind by an Old Ancestor from a long time ago. He was very proficient in the study of mechanics. The mechanisms of this secret room is hard to break and understand. If the correct steps are not taken, then it would be impossible to enter.” Elder Ge smiled gently</p>
 <p>On the next day, Qing Shui eagerly followed Elder Ge to the hidden room. In any case, it would still take quite a while for Zuoshi Clan to come here.</p>
 <p>The hidden room wasn’t actually located in Heavenly Palace. It was located in a valley not so far away from it. It was the place where Diamond Gigantic Elephant experienced its breakthrough. The entrance was within an enormous lake. There were a few Water Repelling Pearls in Elder Ge’s hand.</p>
 <p>The lake had a circumference of a few Lis. It could not considered to be large but it was still quite decent.</p>
 <p>Even though the Water Repelling Pearls weren't considered a gifted earth treasure, they were still precious objects. Qing Shui had them too. He got them from that ‘palace’. Furthermore, those that he got seemed to be obviously better than Elder Ge’s.</p>
 <p>Elder Ge wasn’t really surprised when he saw Qing Shui also had the Water Repelling Pearls. The two of them held the Water Repelling Pearls in their hands and jumped into the lake. After that, they slowly moved forward to the bottom of the lake.</p>
 <p>The lake was about a hundred meters deep. There were only a few fresh-water fish in the lake and the occasional middle or large sized aquatic species like crocodiles. At a less noticeable spot, when Elder Ge took out a one foot long silver-colored key and moved a few enormous stones, a smooth surface that was about the size of a ruler showed up. There was a shallow dark groove on top of it which was almost unnoticeable unless one looked at it carefully.</p>
 <p>Elder Ge inserted the key into it and twisted it a few times and a hole with circumference of around three meters appeared next to it. There was a mysterious force spreading out around the hole to prevent water from flowing into it.</p>
 <p>After the two went in, Elder Ge held the key and twisted it a few times at another similar dark groove. The opened hole went back to its original shape.</p>
 <p>Only at this moment did Qing Shui look toward the dark area that was like a mountain cave.</p>
