 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui had sustained some injuries, he still felt very happy. After all, this time around, he still had some confidence to be coming this time around. As long as he could stand his ground, it would be hard to tell who the victor would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's greatest ability was to control the arena, including for other people and for himself. Right now, he couldn't manage to take care of the Dark Phoenix and Long Zhu`er at the greatest extent possible, but he could still provide some help for them. Moreover, the battle situation on their side was very stable and the true deciding factor of the victory was between himself and the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Surprise, this is really a surprise. I'm considered to be the top three in the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect, yet I wasn't able to take you down even after using the Immortal Slaying God Killing Blow." The old man looked at Qing Shui as if he was smiling but yet not quite so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui still wasn't sure if the old man was the head of the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect, but at his level, he was definitely someone with significant authority in the sect. Even if he was not the leader, he wouldn't be much worse off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In many sects, the leader wasn't the wielder of authority and some important things still required the decision of some Old Ancestor level characters. As for the other matters, unless it concerned the life and death of the sect, the sect lord could call the shots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still the Elder Association and Supreme Grand Elder Association and such above the sect lord. Although these groups didn't hold as much power as the sect lord, they can often affect the sect lord's decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There are many cases where once the sect grows stronger, they would become lost and lose their previous beliefs. The rules of the Heavenly Dao can't be broken and there's karma in life, so you reap what you sow. What do you think?" Qing Shui's body had already recovered and he looked at the old man and said slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the old man heard the term 'Heavenly Dao', his countenance appeared to be a little grim. This was something that was unexplainable yet actually existed. &nbsp;Karma was also something that existed. Although it was a little mysterious, it was true. One would reap what was sowed. If a person did a lot of good deeds, when he were to be in trouble, the chances of the person receiving help would definitely be a lot greater than people who kept on committing evil deeds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui was saying that what the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect was doing was an evil deed, something that went against the Heavenly Dao, the rules of the world. It wasn't something that should be done. In the world of the nine continents, once the Heavenly Dao was involved, the person would feel a tremendous amount of pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lad, we're on opposing ends and this has nothing to do with the Heavenly Dao. When you guys did those things previously, didn't you think about karma? I'm answering to the Heavenly Dao. Everyone would have to be responsible for the things that they do. What do you think about this?" The old man shook his head and regained his composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There are good and evil in this world, and everything is differentiated by just a single thought. Make your move. I must have been muddled to discuss about the good and evil with you. There's no other reason why I said these, because it's an easy feat for me to kill you." &nbsp;Qing Shui locked onto the old man with his sharp gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hahaha!" The old man broke out into a loud laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the old man calmly, "Is it really that funny? Have you ever thought of the possibility of meeting unexpected failures? Do you know that no matter who they were up against, a cultivator should never be careless? Things will take a turn around when it reaches an extreme?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, Qing Shui made his move and his silhouette left a golden line trailing behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a unique attack of the Golden Battle God, the Heavenly God Shadow Reversal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Paragon Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui struck out his most powerful attack with his Golden Battle Halberd. His movement techniques from earlier had created the best conditions for himself. The old man's pupils contracted as thin as a needle's tip, shooting out a cold gleam that seemed as if it was material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">God Immortal Annihilation Combinative Attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the old man had given up on defending and decided to strike out with all of his power in this one attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge sound rang out and forces were shot out from the repercussions of the collision. Brilliant golden light shot out in all directions and both Qing Shui and the old man were sent flying out. However, at the moment that Qing Shui's body flew out, he once again charged over instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Paragon Golden Armor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That brilliant golden light was Qing Shui's golden armor. Even with Qing Shui's powerful defense, he was still pushed to be on the verge of death. After all, the old man had gone all out in that attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an all out attack, even more terrifying than before when he had already been stronger than the old man to begin with. However, the old man hadn't expected that Qing Shui would have an ultimate technique to protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Armor's ability to fend off one lethal attack each day was definitely a paragon technique. It was definitely extremely rare for people to have such an ultimate technique to protect themselves. Compared to Qing Shui, the old man wasn't as lucky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For his all out attack to be stopped, and for his body to be struck by Qing Shui's most powerful attack when it was as its weakest... The result was horrendous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's Paragon Strike was extremely powerful. Even the old man couldn't fend off an attack that was six times more powerful that Qing Shui's strength. Moreover, this was when the old man's condition was relatively weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, this blow was lethal. However, relying on his rich experience, he managed to dodge the lethal blow. However, it was useless. Qing Shui's attack crushed his shoulders and smashed all the meridian channels in his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man felt that his powers were gushing out for eternity from his body like seawater. Qing Shui was stunned by this as well. it was because he realized that the Golden Battle Halberd could have a certain change in destroying the opponent's body completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui were to save the old man right now, he would be able to save half of the old man's cultivation. The world of the Dantian and meridian channels were the forbidden areas for alchemists and physicians. Right now, even if there was a powerful physician or alchemist, they would still be helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man's current situation was the equivalent of someone having contracted an incurable disease. To a cultivator, their cultivation was even more important than their lives. If the old man was made to live his remaining life just like an ordinary person, he'd rather die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To a cultivator, hard work and difficulty was nothing. As long as one had their cultivation, everything was possible. However, without their powers, and to not have even the hope of regaining it, then there would be no more hope in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the old man's forlorn expression. His cultivation had seeped out to its final bit. Qing Shui hadn't thought of providing him with treatment. To pity the opponent, to show mercy to the enemy, would be sacrificing yourself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn't take long, but only Qing Shui knew of the dangers involved. Even the Paragon Golden Armor had appeared. If he didn't have the Paragon Golden Armor, the result today was likely to end with both parties perishing. It was only with the Paragon Golden Armor that Qing Shui was able to perform even better. Without it, it would be really hard to tell who the winner would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both the Dark Phoenix and Long Zhu`er were still engaged in an intense battle. However, it was a pity that the result in the fight here had already affected the other side. The other two old men were already seized by terror. It was because when the old man had lost to Qing Shui, their fates were already decided.</span></p>

The two old men knew this, but in such a situation, it was extremely hard for them to not be distracted. A simple negligence caused the old man on the right to be entangled by one of Long Zhu`er's venomous thread. Then, he was wrapped up into a dumpling. It was already impossible for him to change his fate.</span></p>

This was the strongest enemy the Qing Shui had ever encountered. However, it was also the shortest battle he had ever fought in. The time spent was extremely short.</span></p>

It was because he could trust the Dark Phoenix's defense. At the very least, the Dark Phoenix wouldn't sustain serious injuries.</span></p>
