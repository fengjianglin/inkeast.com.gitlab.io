 <p><strong>AST 1106 - My Heart Is Akin To A Boulder, No One Can Stop Me From Advancing</strong></p>
 <p>Although the few ladies were unwilling, they had no choice but to listen to him. At times like this, they could only rely on him, so they couldn’t afford to be his burden.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan retreated with the rest after reminding Qing Shui to be careful. They stood on their designated spots so that they would be ready to get into a formation at any time and were also prepared to summon their demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded at them with a smile before shifting his gaze towards these people from the Lion King’s Ridge across him, especially the dozen old men in front. They were definitely the influential figures of the Lion King’s Ridge and their positions there were most definitely not low.</p>
 <p>“It’s getting late!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui greeted the old men with a smile before taking out his Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p>“Young man, we’ve also heard quite a lot about you. We’re not going to hold back. We won’t have any regrets even if we die here. You don’t need to hold back either. Give us all you’ve got and we won’t go easy on you either. We won’t mind if these old bones of ours can live another few more years.” The old man took out a crystal longsword and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Old man, you are really liberal. Regardless of whether you are sincere or not, my heart is akin to a boulder. I will have no mercy at all towards you. No one can stop me from advancing.” Qing Shui slowly raised the Big Dipper Sword in his hands.</p>
 <p>“Get into formation!”</p>
 <p>The old man said lightly after seeing Qing Shui. His voice was clear, melodious and indescribably clear-cut. Qing Shui could also felt a brief penetrative force behind it.</p>
 <p>“Lion King’s Golden Ni Formation!”</p>
 <p>Two hundred people among them immediately followed a strange path pattern before standing back at their original spot. This time, it was different from the Lion King’s Li Fire Formation. There was no halo and the leading old man stood right at the front, at the Golden Ni’s head.</p>
 <p>The remaining more than 200 people subtlely got into a formation in the surroundings, distantly coordinating with the Lion King’s Golden Ni Formation at the front. The old man never once took his eyes off Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, show us your specialty. Don’t get accidentally injured just because you didn’t make use of your powerful cultivation. You will lose more than you gain. I won’t show any courtesy.” The old man still had a pleasant look on his face.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>ROAR!</p>
 <p>A loud but slightly muffled roar of the Earth Diamond Bear rang out. The sound waves of the roar were like waves of clouds, one layer after another. This was an illusory demonic beast armor manifestation of an Earth Diamond Bear. It would be very terrifying if it was a fully-grown real Earth Diamond Bear.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Up to this point, Qing Shui naturally wasn’t going to be courteous. He immediately dashed over with the Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Sword of Sixth Wave!</p>
 <p>Under the laws of heaven and earth’s restriction, the might of his sword was greatly reduced. Similarly, this also meant that the strength of those people across from him would be greatly reduced.</p>
 <p>Golden Ni Eyes!</p>
 <p>CLANG!</p>
 <p>The crystal sword in the old man’s hands blocked the Big Dipper Sword with precision and immediately sent Qing Shui flying in the opposite direction.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt something surging in his body all of a sudden. If he hadn’t attained the small success stage of Nine Yang Golden Body, he wouldn’t be able to block even this. Qing Shui already brought his physical strength to its peak and was even confident in his Nine Palace Steps. He was still able to estimate of his opponent’s strength. After all, his spiritual sense wasn’t only for show.</p>
 <p>The fact that Qing Shui was able to withstand this attack was also a great surprise to the old man. He didn’t expect Qing Shui would directly resist it with his body. For Qing Shui, he was also relying on the Nine Palace Steps and the Taichi Diversion technique. Otherwise, he wouldn’t take such a risk.</p>
 <p>He waved his left hand!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain appeared before Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, he slapped on the Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain’s offensive power was nearly 40,000 stars and had twice Qing Shui’s speed. However, Qing Shui could also dash towards his opponents with the same speed as the Nine Continents Mountain by relying on the miracle of the Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>They converged their attacks towards the old man!</p>
 <p>Golden Ni Horn!</p>
 <p>Two other old men appeared by the sides of the old man within a flash. The two similar crystal swords that shimmered like sparkling water in their hands collided against the Nine Continents Mountain that struck down from above.</p>
 <p>Clink clink…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was knocked backwards once again. The 20% chance of double damage didn’t appear but the Shield Attack effect appeared instead. Qing Shui was knocked back from the impact and the three old men from the other party were also knocked back</p>
 <p>Every attack of the Nine Continents Mountain carried the Shield Attack effect. As long as there wasn’t a large disparity between strengths, opponents would be knocked back.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui was pulling back, he could still control the Nine Continents Mountain with his consciousness to continue attacking!</p>
 <p>Golden Ni Armor!</p>
 <p>Everyone’s body was cladded by a faint layer of protective armor. This amplification was not inferior to the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. On the contrary, it might even surpass it. Besides, most people here were not qualified to cultivate the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Bam bam…</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain rapidly rammed into the old men about ten times. They tried their best to readjust the shape of their formation, yet it was still a little all over the place.</p>
 <p>Lion King’s Eclipse!</p>
 <p>A few crystal swords immediately converged together to form a net that was made out of qi to trap the Nine Continents Mountain. Qing Shui was surprised that the Nine Continents Mountain was actually unable to struggle itself free.</p>
 <p>Withdraw!</p>
 <p>He successfully withdrew it before summoning it once again. In the end, it was still trapped by the opponents like it was just now. Qing Shui could only let them wear themselves down by spending their energy on dealing with the Nine Continents Mountain. Controlling the Nine Continents Mountain required only his consciousness so it was very convenient. Qing Shui could create a lot of trouble for his opponents with the Nine Continents Mountain as soon as they slipped up.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the few old men with a smile. “Show me your most powerful move. Otherwise, you’ll lose the chance to do so!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his hands as soon as he finished speaking and two Primordial Flame Dragons gushed forth. A dull noise was heard within the whizzing noise. Qing Shui didn’t really feel anything when he was in the Ancient Ruins but even though this place was under the influence of the law of heaven and earth, his spirit energy could completely ignore the effects of the laws due to the Arhat Rosary Beads. The strength of merely about 120,000 stars carried a wave of destructive aura with it.</p>
 <p>Golden Ni Manifestation!</p>
 <p>When the old men saw the Primordial Flame Dragons that Qing Shui unleashed, they immediately abandoned the Nine Continents Mountain. Their countenances paled as they screamed. Within an instant, an enormous golden halo arose. A Golden Ni Lion came into life before Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>It was way stronger than the Lion King’s Li Fire Formation. The aura that it exuded was akin to the boundless sea, which wasn’t something that could simply be compared to the Lion King’s Li Fire Formation.</p>
 <p>The enormous Golden Ni Formation was even larger than Nine Continents Mountain at its largest size. It was truly like a small mountain, making Qing Shui to appear as tiny as an ant in front of it.</p>
 <p>Golden Ni True Fire!</p>
 <p>Raging flames appeared on the body of the gigantic Golden Ni. To the Golden Ni, this type of flames was like a flame armor. Its huge and ferocious head, which bore a slight resemblance to that of a dragon, immediately breathed out a sea of fire towards Qing Shui</p>
 <p>The temperature around him rose terrifyingly. Even the air itself felt as if it had been ignited. That blazing sea of fire was still the Li Fire, even though it was a lot more intense than those Li Fires in the past.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what to feel right now. After cultivating the Flames of Yin-Yang (which was the Primordial Flames), he had realized that he had an extremely high resistance towards flames. In addition to the effects of the Arhat Rosary Beads and Spirited Snake Turtle, this type of damage had been reduced by more than 70%......</p>
 <p>It had been reduced so much that it was basically ineffective towards Qing Shui. The Flame of Five Elements was the most destructive. It was brutal, violent and extremely explosive. Powerful battle techniques and demonic beasts were all fire types, this wasn’t limited to only the Lion King’s Ridge.</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter even if it wasn’t a fire type. The Arhat Rosary Beads and Spirited Snake Turtle had enabled him to have an absolute advantage when it came to resisting this kind of elemental attack.</p>
 <p>In addition to his Nine Yang Golden Body, Qing Shui stood amongst the sea of flames as if nothing had happened. All of a sudden, a wave of powerful aura was exuded from him.</p>
 <p>Yin-Yang Devour!</p>
 <p>A radius of 10 meters around Qing Shui was immediately devoid of flames.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flames: Double Dragon Drill!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui flung both of his palms towards that gigantic ‘Golden Ni Lion’!</p>
 <p>SLAP!</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion swayed violently!</p>
 <p>ROAAAAAAR!</p>
 <p>A voice akin to a lion’s roar rang out. The ‘Golden Ni Lion’ breathed out a huge wall of fire in front of the Primordial Flame Dragon’s Double Dragon Drill.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spirit energy surged violently. At the same time, the Nine Continents Mountain directly rammed into the thick fire wall under Qing Shui’s control. The two flame dragons penetrated the wall of fire while the Nine Continents Mountain smashed it into pieces, causing it to become fiery stars that decorated the skies.</p>
 <p>ROAR!</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion let out a loud roar when Qing Shui’s two flame dragons once again drew near to it. Its body quickly shrank and appeared to be even more condensed. It breathed out a gigantic flame dragon from its mouth, which rushed head on towards Qing Shui’s Primordial Flame Dragons.</p>
 <p>Chi chi…...</p>
 <p>A melting noise was heard. The Primordial Flame Dragons kept corroding the flame dragon that the Golden Ni Lion had breathed out. Although not too fast, Qing Shui was still at an absolute advantage.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Just then, the remaining 200 or so people unexpectedly got into a formation with lightning speed and manifested a Golden Ni Lion of a size smaller. It then breathed out an enormous and brilliant fire ball, which was as big as a house.</p>
 <p>Spirit Transmission!</p>
 <p>The slightly droopy ‘Golden Ni Lion’ was recharged all of a sudden. Its figure evaded the Primordial Flame Dragon Drill before it immediately pounced towards Qing Shui. The two gigantic horns on top of its head instantly became its sharpest weapons.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Bam!</p>
 <p>A collision was heard. Qing Shui was a little surprised that currently, the Nine Continents Mountain was only able to barely hold off the Golden Ni Lion’s momentum and not knocking it back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also wary of its powerful four limbs and sharp horns at its approach. Right now, it was not possible for his current physical strength to withstand the physical attack of this Golden Ni Lion. Fortunately, his Nine Continents Mountain was able to make up for this weakness.</p>
 <p>Bam!</p>
 <p>Even the Nine Continents Mountain was sent flying backwards by the Golden Ni Lion.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Nine Continents Mountain that was sent flying back. He unleashed a Sword of Sixth Wave on the Nine Continents Mountain with his Big Dipper Sword and at the same time, controlled the Nine Continents Mountain to charge towards the Golden Ni Lion that was dashing towards them.</p>
 <p>Bam!</p>
 <p>This time, it was the Golden Ni Lion who got knocked back. It seemed like the Golden Ni Lion’s strength was also about 100,000 stars. Qing Shui was mostly developing battle techniques right now. Even if these people standing before him weren’t threatening his life, he didn’t dare to be reckless either, so he hadn’t used his full strength all this time. What he was using right now was only the strength before absorbing the dragon’s qi. Back then he was actually very confident in going to the Lion King’s Ridge. From the look of things, if he had come here with the same amount of strength he had back then, the outcome would be rather difficult to predict.</p>
 <p>Hence, he would never miss any opportunity to raise his strength in every battle. Today, he made another discovery that the might of the Nine Continents Mountain could actually be raised tremendously by giving it a push like this.</p>
 <p>Bam bam…...</p>
 <p>With the miraculous Nine Palace Steps and the Nine Continents Mountain, that was controlled with Qing Shui’s consciousness, it appeared and disappeared like a ghost around the Golden Ni Lion and then relentlessly attacked it. The Golden Ni Lion was struggling and weary from being hit. When it comes to endurance, Qing Shui had the most terrifying endurance. Besides, the Lion King’s Golden Ni Formation that was formed by so many people would have a high consumption, let alone manifesting it.</p>
 <p>By now Qing Shui was getting better in attacking and defending with the Nine Continents Mountain, as well as combining forces and performing a joint attack with it…...</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion immediately exploded. Qing Shui seemed to be unaware of the situation when he was lost in this kind of trance. The opponents had only come to a realization that they were no match for Qing Shui after witnessing Qing Shui killing more than 200 people…...</p>
