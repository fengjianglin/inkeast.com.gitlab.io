 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong was also dumbfounded, but he was a little more frank. His heart was with Ling Fei and he had his own child, so it was easier for him to control. Liking beautiful women was the innate power and character of a man. Just like the saying “everyone loves beauty”. Some only enjoyed it from afar, whereas some had lustful thoughts and some would even act upon them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people have said: Without strength or confidence, a person would be very bland. Someone with confidence but without strength would be a hassle, at the end nothing would come out of their jokes. And someone with both strength and confidence would have their wishes fulfilled. Of course, some people within that category would do things out of the ordinary, this would be like committing a sin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether Yin Tong had strength and confidence, that would depend on who was answering the question. If it were normal women then it didn’t need to be mentioned, if it were against the woman before him then it wouldn’t be a contest. If they really compete, be it status or cultivation, this woman before him would outclass him immensely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong didn’t question what Qing Shui said when they saw the woman. As soon as they saw her, they knew what he said was true. This woman was that strong State Master, her aura had already impressed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the two looked at each other. They smiled then left, leaving Qing Shui alone there. This was the outside courtyard of the Imperial Cuisine Hall and also the place people arrived as soon as they stepped through the main door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood there holding Qing Xiu. Although he expected the woman to come, he didn’t think that it’d be that quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman had a soft smile. She was walking very close to Qing Shui before stopping. In this close proximity, Qing Shui could see the long dark eyelashes of the woman clearly. There was an indescribable sexiness. Even her straight nose was like a God’s carving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your son is really beautiful,” the woman said, her beautiful eyes was watching Qing Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm, how do you know that it’s my son and not my daughter,” Qing Shui asked, because many people had at first thought that Qing Xiu was a girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Qing Shui saw the look in the woman’s eyes, she was looking at the bottom of the boy. Although it was gold, the little one was still wearing clothes with an open bottom. Naturally this explained everything to Qing Shui, so he nodded his head, “I see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s face turned red and she avoided Qing Shui’s gaze. She felt very embarrassed, Qing Shui was a small child so it didn’t matter, but being next to Qing Shui, the situation was different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman really wanted to say ‘so what if you knew’, but she didn’t. She looked around her surroundings, and was surveyed the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time she went to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. To the point where she didn’t know that it had already closed its doors. She only heard of Qing Shui’s expertise from word of mouth, and came on purpose, but now she felt that maybe this young man’s expertise was really good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you want me to show you around?” Qing Shui said with a smile, no matter what this woman had helped him a little. She teaching him on how to use the Golden Battle Halberd and the Nine Yang Dragon Soul in tandem. It would give him more protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” the woman said happily, nodding her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they entered the backyard, the few women were there. As they saw Qing Shui and the woman come in, they naturally came to greet them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the woman saw Yiye Jiange take the child from Qing Shui’s arms, she knew that she was his mother and was struck by her beauty. Actually, she was really surprised that the women here were all above average and she felt that the women and the men here had an extraordinary relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they say, if you want to see how a person is, then you must look at his company. Actually, more specifically take a look at his woman or man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, aren’t you going to introduce me to this wonderful woman?” Qin Qing said mischievously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his nose, “All I know is that she is the State Master of the Great Confucian Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Qing Shui introduced the women to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the time, he realized that it was almost noon. The women also didn’t say what they wanted to do and Qing Shui also didn’t ask. But he could guess that by asking her to eat with them she wouldn’t say no.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know the name of the woman. She also didn’t reveal it and Qing Shui didn’t think of having any sort of deep relationship with her, therefore, the name didn’t matter that much. All he needed to know was that she was the State Master of the Great Confucian Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you interested in her?” Yiye Jiange said with Qing Xiu in her arms, she was the last to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui reached his arms out and touched her shoulder without changing his tone, “Now what are you thinking?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange didn’t dare to speak since there were people in front. All she could do was shooting Qing Shui a glance and that was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui still enjoyed Yiye Jiange’s little antics. After all, she was the type of woman who had an attitude. Even though they had been married for such a long time, even had a child together, this attitude hadn’t diminished. It had even increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When there was nothing much to do, Qing Shui liked teasing her. He liked seeing her become embarrassed beyond belief, as though she was a Goddess that was pulled into the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I such a bastard?” Qing Shui thought about him going after other women even though he had so many of them already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui wasn’t thinking of teasing this State Master, his relationship with her hadn’t reached that point. What he meant was the Vampiric Empress, but they still didn’t know. Qing Shui wasn’t trying to hide it, but there were things that would cause harm if revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But having multiple wives was a normality in the Nine Continents, even women could accept that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ve already done well, I could understand other women, so I won’t interfere with you. They also wouldn’t interfere, but would you forget me after getting more?” Yiye Jiange said lightly, only both of them could hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange felt that she couldn’t leave him, the road they had walked together was not easy. Qing Shui and Qing Xiu were her everything, so she could understand Qing Shui’s other women, so she wouldn’t interfere with this aspect of things and didn’t even think about it. She felt that everything today was enough. She didn’t dare think about the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My dear, even if I went crazy, I wouldn’t forget you,” it was rare for Qing Shui to say something like this, but it was the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange’s mouth turned into a smile, the fortunate expression on her face was showing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a man made their woman happy from the inside out, they would be very happy. Especially on the inside, because that was what really mattered in terms of feelings. At least the most important part of their partner was happy, their spirit and body...</span></p>
