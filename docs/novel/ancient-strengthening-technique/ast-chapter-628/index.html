 <p><strong>AST 628 - The knot in Di Chen’s heart, Di Chen’s father</strong></p>
 <p>“Who? Who is he?” Di Chen asked puzzledly as she looked at her brother.</p>
 <p>Di Fentian frowned, almost as if he was debating with himself internally. After a while, he slowly replied, “You will find out sooner or later anyway. I’ll just tell you everything today. At that time, I didn’t have a choice.”</p>
 <p>Di Chen did not say anything. She looked at Di Fentian silently, waiting for him to continue.</p>
 <p>“This story is a little confusing but I will just say it directly. Actually, the threat from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord is not resolved. This is because there is still someone alive. He is the real head of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. He is an old demon and had secluded himself in the Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda. Otherwise, he would have already visited Brother Qing Shui. “</p>
 <p>“There is still an expert in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord? What is the Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda?” Di Chen asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“That expert actually left the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord a couple of years ago. Unless there was a large commotion, he basically did not interfere in the matters in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. The Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda is a gigantic pagoda that possesses a mysterious formidable force field. It is said that training inside will halve the effort required.” Di Fentian replied openly.</p>
 <p>“If that is so, why isn’t the Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda considered one of the Seven Stars?”</p>
 <p>“That is because too few people are aware of the existence of the Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda.”</p>
 <p>As he finished his sentence, Di Fentian shook his head and looked at Di Chen. “ Look, I went off topic again. Let’s just talk about the old demon from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.”</p>
 <p>“That old demon is called Ba Junlin. He is one generation older than our grandfather. His cultivation level is extremely high. Most importantly, he is very powerful but no one know exactly how powerful he is. He also saved our grandfather’s life once. That was the reason why the two families which were already on good terms became even closer.”</p>
 <p>When Di Fentian explained to this point, Qing Shui got the general idea. This situation was created probably because the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord wanted to better the relationship of the two clans, so they proposed an alliance by marriage. The thing he could not understand was why it had to be Di Chen’s generation.</p>
 <p>“The old demon could see the decline of the younger generation in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. When he visited the Di Clan, he noticed that you had a skeletal structural exceptionally suited for martial arts. He foresaw that you will be very successful in your cultivation. Furthermore, our father’s cultivation level was much higher than those from the same generation in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. He could see that our father doted on you the most, so he had his eyes on you.” Di Fentian said, grimacing a little.</p>
 <p>“So our father just agreed to that?” Di Chen looked at Di Fentian asking.</p>
 <p>“Ba Junlin approached our grandfather directly. He did not even consult our father. Our father only found out when Grandfather went to look for him. At that time, Ba Junlin visited the Di Clan with many other influential people from Seven Stars Country. Furthermore, Ba Junlin had done our family a great favour. Di Clan had always been righteous and understood the principle of repaying one’s kindness. Under those circumstances, there really was no alternative. Besides, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord was also one of the Seven Stars, so we were on the same social standing. With that, he agreed.” Di Fentian felt helpless as he stopped here.</p>
 <p>Di Chen fell silent. She could imagine how it was at that time. Many things in life were beyond one’s control. Di Chen fully understood that the children of a powerful clan basically had no freedom to marry who they want. It was not that bad for the men as they could take a few wives. But the women were pitiful. If they have to marry men that they do not like and they could not fall in love with their husbands, their entire lives would be miserable.</p>
 <p>“Chen’er, please come back. Our father tried his best but he was pressured by the elders in the family. Because of this, he almost left the clan. There aren’t many family members in our Di Clan, we aren’t as unfeeling as members from the other larger clans. When our father saw our grandfather worrying, he decided to carry that burden as a son. He made a painful decision. He did not dare to talk to you or even get close to you because he was afraid that he might just snatch you back home…”</p>
 <p>Di Chen did not say a word. The reason sounded far-fetched but it was more than enough. Qing Shui shook his head, smiling bitterly as he stood beside her.</p>
 <p>In the World of the Nine Continents, women had a comparatively lower status in society. If Qing Shui had to make the decision, he would have treated the two matters separately. The Di Clan did owe the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord a huge favor but there were definitely other ways to repay them. He did not know why they had come to such a painful decision.</p>
 <p>“I am living well now. Since I left Di Clan, I don’t plan to ever go back.” Di Chen smiled at Di Fentian, showing that she had resolved many of the issues that troubled her heart.</p>
 <p>“Chen’er, Dad misses you. Di Clan is your family!” Di Fentian said hurriedly.</p>
 <p>“When I needed help, nobody even came. I really don’t care for such a family.” Di Chen said firmly, shaking her head.</p>
 <p>“Sister!”</p>
 <p>Di Qing suddenly shouted.</p>
 <p>“Since they made that decision in the past, why do they even expect me to return now?” Di Chen shook her head again and looked at Di Fentian.</p>
 <p>“Actually, when you left the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, Ba Tianwang came over to the Di Clan with no sense of propriety at all. He even proposed to take Qing’er as his wife. Qing’er was already at a peak Martial King at that time. This infuriated our grandfather. He berated Ba Tianwang for overstepping his boundaries and chased them away immediately.” Di Fentian said angrily.</p>
 <p>“How could they do this…” Di Chen looked at Di Qing. She was obviously angered by this as well.</p>
 <p>“At that time, our father nearly took action. It was an insult to the Di Clan, so they chased them away immediately. We broke off all ties with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. Outsiders did not know this and that was the reason why the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord went over to Greencloud Continent. Thankfully, the outcome of that was beyond anybody’s expectation. That was something to be happy about.”</p>
 <p>“Big brother. Thanks for visiting me in the past. Now that I know what had happened, I won’t be going back to the Di Residence. We will stay a few more days here and we will leave.” Di Chen decided that there was no need to go back to the Di Residence.</p>
 <p>“Sigh!”</p>
 <p>A clear sigh came from the door.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his Spiritual sense and felt a familiar faint aura at the door. That was the aura that he had felt over the past few days. He could not tell how powerful the person was.</p>
 <p>Hearing that voice, Di Chen was startled. She turned to look at the door as a middle aged man walked in. His scholarly look was accompanied by an air of worldliness. He had an exceptionally manly aura.</p>
 <p>He was handsome and his eyes were bright. He had sword-like eyebrows and a straight, erect nose. There was a tinge of silver in his sideburns and he wore a silvery white robe. He was smiling at Di Chen. His doting eyes showed a complex range of emotions; he looked guilty, apologetic, regretful, helpless…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know that a person’s eyes could express so many emotions at the same time. From his appearance and presence, he could tell that this was Di Chen and Di Qing’s father.</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>“Dad!”</p>
 <p>Di Fentian and Di Qing greeted the man.</p>
 <p>He nodded and approached Di Chen slowly.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked at the man she had not seen for years. His appearance had not changed much, but he looked more burdened and more unfamiliar. That made her feel sorrowful.</p>
 <p>“Chen’er, I was useless. That’s why you had to suffer.” the man said gently.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked blankly at the man she should call her father, but she did not say a word. She actually want to cry but she held back her tears. She tried so hard...</p>
 <p>Her heart was so painful, she even felt a little conflicted.</p>
 <p>“Chen’er, is this your husband? That’s great. But can you spare a thought for him? He can’t win that old demon right now.” the man said to Di Chen as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui just walked and stood silently beside Di Chen. He could see Di Chen's fragility and unease. He wanted to stand beside her so that she knew she could rely on him. He did not say a word as he wanted to give her space to make up her mind. How she reacted will affect the rest of her life. Qing Shui knew that Di Chen still had feelings for her family, otherwise she would not have travelled so far.</p>
 <p>“Was it because the Di Clan isn’t strong enough to win that old demon?” Di Chen asked looking at the man.</p>
 <p>He smiled bitterly, nodding his head. “That was one of the reasons. And just like what Tian’er said. In that situation, the Di Clan really could not afford to offend the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. They pressured us into the decision and nobody dared to go against that old demon.”</p>
 <p>“Is there anyone in Di Clan that can fight against him now?” Di Chen asked in a serious manner.</p>
 <p>“Originally, yes, but the Old Ancestor died three years ago. Before he died, he gave me some guidance. He also bestowed many items which were useful for cultivation. I managed to make a breakthrough last year. Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to challenge that old demon. Thankfully, there are others in our clan. If we work together, I think there is hope.” the man said calmly.</p>
 <p>Di Chen hesitated and looked like she was considering something. She looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“How about this? You both should stay at the Di Residence. That old demon will never leave the matter as it is. Why don’t you make the decision after we’ve defeated that old demon?” The man asked Di Chen. Finally, he looked at Qing Shui, his eyes somehow revealed the complex thoughts that went through his mind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not anticipate that there was still another expert in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. Regarding such situations, he rather take a precautionary stance. They even mentioned that this old demon would definitely take revenge. He knew that he had to be more alert. Since he killed the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, that demon will definitely look for him.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui was bewildered. The two Martial Saint elders in the Qing Clan did not mention this to him. Did they not know anything about this? Or did they decide not to say anything?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it and decided that they did not know. After all, the old demon had left the sect for many years!</p>
 <p>“We already have reliable news that that the old demon will come out and arrive here within three months. Someone has already reported everything to him. The Di Clan and Qing Shui are the old demon’s first targets in his revenge plot. If both of you were spotted, it will be too dangerous. It will be safer for you to stay…” the man said after some thoughts.</p>
 <p>“Sir, what is the gap between you and that person? Uh, I don’t mean anything else. I just want to see how I can help you.” Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>“I am not sure. I think I am weaker than him by 500 countries, or even a little more. But the gap is definitely not more than 1000.” the man replied after thinking for awhile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did some calculation and estimated that this man from the Di Clan was probably above Grade Eight Martial Saint — his strength was probably around 3500 countries. If the old demon was 800 countries stronger than this man, than the old demon must have a strength of about 4300 to 4500 countries.</p>
 <p>“Chen’er. Why don’t we stay here and kill the old demon first. What do you say about that?” Qing Shui looked at Di Chen and asked. He wanted to help Di Chen and that man but it was still up to her.</p>
 <p>Di Chen looked at Qing Shui as she knitted her beautiful brows. Qing Shui could feel that Di Chen was worried for him. He held one of her hands, giving her some assurance.</p>
 <p>“Please stay. Even if you don’t acknowledge me as your father. I just need to know that both of you are safe before you leave. Seeing that you have such a good husband, I really feel happy for you. Your mother would also be elated.” the man said with a gentle smile, nostalgically. He was really very happy for her.</p>
 <p>Di Chen trembled a little as she heard his words. When she was young, before her mother died, her parents had a very close relationship. She felt like she was the most fortunate person on Earth, but now...</p>
 <p>She really missed those times!</p>
 <p>“Alright, we will stay here for some time. Once that threat is eliminated, we will leave.” Di Chen replied the man softly.</p>
 <p>When they heard her words, the man, Di Fentian and Di Qing were all very happy. If Di Chen stayed, that meant there was still hope.</p>
 <p>“Sir, let me know when you are going to fight with that old demon. If it is just 500 to 1000 countries, I have a method that can help boost your strength so that you will be at his level or maybe more.”</p>
 <p>The man’s eyes brightened when he heard Qing Shui’s words. He took a good look at Qing Shui. Even at his level, he could only vaguely tell that Qing Shui’s strength was about the Peak of Grade Two Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>But he knew that he was wrong. This young man managed to kill off Grade Five Martial Saints who can display Grade Six Martial Saint skills. The young man must have some hidden talent.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, after leaving, his daughter only took a few days to overcome her difficulty in breaking through to the realm of Martial Saint, and she was already an extremely young Martial Saint.</p>
