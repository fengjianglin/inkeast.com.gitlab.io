 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman didn’t say anything when she finished eating. Instead, she looked at Qing Shui seriously. Her eyes looked serious and also a bit strange at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, strange, that was how it should be. In any case, it was not like they knew each other very well. It was only their second time meeting each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman got everything she had today all thanks to the Jade Fragrance Pavilion. The reason she had her position today was also closely related to the Jade Fragrance Pavilion. But today, her very own Jade Fragrance Pavilion was facing a really great threat, so much that if the man was willing to, he could have completely replaced the entire Jade Fragrance Pavilion with the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui remained silent. He was waiting for the woman to speak. He knew that the woman would definitely say something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is indeed a great surprise. It’s always said that those who run the same kind of businesses often end up as enemies. Tell me, shall I consider you as my enemy?” The woman smiled and mentioned. Like usual, she didn’t sound mad when she was saying it. In fact, it even sounded like she was happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Jade Fragrance Pavilion mainly focuses on cuisine. Hence, it would hardly clash with the things that I run here. I usually mind my own business.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine even if we clash. I have thought about situations like this before. I just never expected for it to happen so soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui really admired the woman for her honesty. He really hoped that her honesty truly came out from her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, countless footsteps could be heard coming through from outside. Soon, the noises were replaced by the sound of people talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look the Lang Clan’s Head is here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, it seems that things are going to get interesting today.” said the woman. Qing Shui was speechless. Indeed, there would be troublesome people wherever he went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you think the Lang Clan’s Head will do?” Someone asked out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you still have to ask? For sure, this young man will be in a big trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t underestimate the young man. The young man mustn’t be an ordinary person, he actually dares to act this way in front of the Lang Clan. In fact, maybe even the Lang Clan couldn’t do anything to him.” This man had a very strong voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Somehow, that’s also how I feel. It seems that today, things may get really interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">About ten people entered the Imperial Cuisine Hall. In a while, the initially relaxed atmosphere became tense in an instant. Qing Shui looked at the people that were entering the hall. The leader was a man. He looked very young and was emitting a very thick aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment “Madam Lang” just happened to be walking down from the 2nd floor. When she was halfway down the stairs, she saw the man who was leading the group and immediately trembled. The man also saw “Madam Lang”. At this moment, the man’s expression became even uglier. He moved his sight into Qing Shui and stared at him very fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui had already stood up. He was smiling as he looked at the Lang Clan’s people, “Today is the opening day of my shop. I welcome all of you to visit our shop.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you forgotten the things which I told you? Hmph, it seems you have managed to recover your strength. There is no other way. I will just cripple it once again.” The man acted as if he hadn’t noticed Qing Shui. He didn’t even bother batting an eye on him. He immediately looked at the woman and said what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In return for his favor, the woman ignored the Lang Clan’s head and no longer bothered to look at him. Instead, she walked to Qing Shui’s side, “Sorry for the troubles, I ....”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s enough. Now that you are a person of the Imperial Cuisine Hall, it’s natural that you will be under my protection.” Qing Shui knew what the woman wanted to say. Hence, he immediately interrupted her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lang Clan’s Head got even more furious after being ignored. At this moment, he looked at Qing Shui and said, “Get the heck out of this place! Now! The further you go! The better! Don’t force me to make my move. If not, you will die a miserable death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that the words this time were meant for him. He didn’t feel that the man was lying either. In fact, the Lang Clan had enough power, or rather, he himself assumed that he had the power to bully Qing Shui. It was perfectly normal for the Lang Clan’s Head to speak like that. Nor would anyone think that he was just bluffing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. His smile looked very relaxed. Yet at this moment, “Madam Lang” urged Qing Shui in a nervous tone, “Sir, please leave now. The further you go, the better. Don’t come back ever again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Lang Clan’s Clan Head saw his own woman like that, as he looked at her extremely beautiful face that was filled with anxiety. Deep down, he was very saddened by it. This was once his woman, a woman whom he loved deeply. Yet, he chose some other things over her, causing him to lose her forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, seeing her so worried about another man, he felt a kind of sadness beyond words. But soon, that sadness turned into anger. He looked at Qing Shui furiously. This man must not live! Even if he might not be the reason that he lost the woman, this man must die! Since he was unable to get his hands on the woman, no one should ever be allowed to do it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Madam Lang and shook his head, “Well, I would love to see just what kind of “pathetic” death I would face today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lang Clan’s Clan Head seemed to be shocked. He looked at Qing Shui in surprise. He never expected for this man to be so stubborn. However, a ruthless look flashed across his eyes, “Destroy everything here! I would love to see what he could do about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people from the Lang Clan immediately walked towards one of the shelves in the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua-la! Peng-peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, loud noises could be heard constantly. Qing Shui didn’t make any move. He just stood there and didn’t do anything. The owner of Jade Fragrance Pavilion knitted her brows. At the moment she stood up and wanted to say something, Qing Shui smiled, “Thank you mistress, for coming here today. It seems there are things going on at the moment and hence, I may not be able to aid you with anything. You may leave first if you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman shook her head, “I think it would be better if I stay behind. Do you need any help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “Nope!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made the woman even more curious. His shop was being vandalized. Why did it feel like he was still in a good mood? It was very hard to describe… In fact, he seemed to be in an unusually good mood as well. He acted as if it was not his shop that was being vandalized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very quickly, almost everything on the first floor was crushed. The entire room was filled with the smell of medicinal herbs. The medicinal herbs could be seen scattered across the room.</span></p>

The moment he saw the little brat, to everyone’s surprises, he actually held up his metal rod and attacked the little brat.</span></p>

If it wasn’t the order of the Lang Clan’s Head, this man definitely wouldn’t dare to attack the little brat. There was no way he wouldn’t know who the little brat was. At this moment, the woman came back to her senses. However, the man’s attack was very sudden and fast. Even if she intended to go and save the little brat, there were still a few people standing in her away and each of them possessed quite a decent strength. Even with the woman’s strength, it was impossible for her to defeat these men before the metal rod landed on the brat.</span></p>

The man holding the metal rod came to a stop. After that, he dropped down slowly. At this moment, a chopstick could be seen penetrating through his brain.</span></p>

Following on, a consecutive “peng-peng” noises were heard.</span></p>

In a while, one after another, they dropped down outside of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Each of them spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood and collapsed on the ground. Though they didn’t die, they no longer had enough energy to even stand up.</span></p>

She looked very pale. The look of despair on her face had become even stronger.</span></p>

Though he only defeated a few trash, that smooth movement and speed, and the precise attacks with not even the slightest hesitations, it was already a kind of pleasure just looking at it.</span></p>

My shop only opened today and you already dare to crush my big day. I’m afraid you will have to compensate for the damages that you made. But then, there is one thing which I am really curious about, it’s always been said that even animals know to not feed on their own children. Why does it seem to me that you are worse than an animal?” Qing Shui turned around and smiled as he walked towards the young Clan Head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no change in Clan Head Lang’s expression. He acted as if he didn’t hear what Qing Shui said. When he looked at Qing Shui, he actually revealed a smile, “No one has ever talked to me like that. Alright, today I will calculate all the bills with you and at the same time, also let you see just how miserable you are.”</span></p>
