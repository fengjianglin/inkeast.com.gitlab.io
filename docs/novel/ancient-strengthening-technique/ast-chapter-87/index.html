 <p><strong>Chapter 87 Second Level of the Violet Jade Immortal Realm.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0087 – Second Level of the Violet Jade Immortal Realm</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui glanced at Shi Qingzhuang who had fallen into a deep and peaceful slumber. Only while sleeping, would her ice-cold face become so warm and gentle. Qing Shui furrowed his brows, he knew that the pain left behind by him was something of an enormous magnitude. However, he had no regrets upon thinking back on the comfortably numb sensation that he was feeling in his loins. To think that women were so delicious.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui hugged Shi Qingzhuang who was sleeping, feeling the smoothness of her skin, and enjoying the feeling of silky softness as he kissed her cheeks softly.</p>
  <p>Now, Qing Shui surveyed the room he was in carefully. The room was facing the south, and it seemed to be about noon-time now. The warmth of the winter sun seeped in through the windows, creating an enjoyable atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gently covered Shi Qingzhuang with a blanket, covering the alluring figure of Shi Qingzhuang. He sighed in his heart. If only she was his wife…he would definitely be blessed to have a wife as ravishing as her.</p>
  <p>Looking at Shi Qingzhuang who was in an extremely deep state of slumber, Qing Shui estimated that she wouldn’t be waking up any time soon. He slowly donned his clothes, and then walked to the windows and cast his gaze far off into the horizon, lost in his thoughts.</p>
  <p>He had just popped his cherry. The current emotions of Qing Shui were extremely complicated. He just couldn’t put it into words. There was joy, after all, his way of thinking was influenced greatly by his previous life. Shi Qingzhuang, was even more ravishing compared to all the great movie stars and actors from his previous life. Of course, after screwing her, there was also a sense of accomplishment. However, there was also a type of longing, which stemmed from his liking of her, and a feeling of loss…</p>
  <p>To women, nothing was as precious to them as their first time. Don’t be surprised, but this holds true for men as well. Even if a man’s first time was given to a hostess at the stripclub, the man will remember that woman forever!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui turned his head back, glancing at the soundly sleeping Shi Qingzhuang, before sighing. Did I do the right thing? Will things ever be the same between us again?</p>
  <p>After that, he made his way to a remote corner before entering into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>The scene which appeared, caused Qing Shui to be dumbstruck.</p>
  <p>Because the current area of the spatial realm that he was in had expanded multifold, more spacious when compared to what is was previously by about 1.5 times. Qing Shui stood right at the center, blankly staring at his surroundings.</p>
  <p>“Right, I must have somehow leveled the spatial realm up!” Qing Shui happily rushed towards the Stone Steele. Before reaching the inscription steele, Qing Shui had noticed that even the crystal pond had doubled in size, and increased in depth. The originally densely packed fishes and turtles in the crystal pond were now spread far apart, no longer as clustered.</p>
  <p>During this period of time, the black fish had bred and populated quickly. From baby to adult, in a period of only three days, their scales would shine with a radiant luster. While as for the turtles, they were still palm size, and had not populated any more. Qing Shui couldn’t help but wish for the turtle to grow like the fish, but he knew that this couldn’t be forced. The ordinary life-span of turtles was measured in centuries or even millennia.</p>
  <p>Looking at the over 200 turtles swimming about inside the pond, Qing Shui had a gnawing desire to feast on turtle soup again. Turtles were not only nutritious, they were also considered a symbol of good luck in this world. He thought back to the time at the Yu He inn when he ate his first helping of turtle soup. That heavenly taste, and the effects it had had: boosting blood circulation and Qi, collagen for smoother skin, reducing cholesterol and increasing calcium. Only fools would not choose to eat it. In addition to those benefits, there were many ways of cooking it: boiled, steamed and deep fried with veggies.</p>
  <p>Thinking of this, he suddenly realized that Shi Qingzhuang had not eaten anything yet. She would need to nourish her body following the aftermath of the poison detoxification, as well as the enjoyable s*x. Why not he prepare turtle soup for her to drink?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui caught a turtle in his palm, broke apart it’s shell, removed its internal organs, and obtained its meat. Qing Shui used the water from the crystal pond to cleanse and cook it, adding various seasonings to improve the taste.</p>
  <p>Although Qing Shui didn’t know the actual method of cooking turtles, all he had to do was to boil the meat until it was cooked. Not only that, but he could be assured of the quality and taste. After all, the turtle meat originated from a turtle living in the crystal pond of his Violet Jade Immortal Realm.</p>
  <p>Abruptly, Qing Shui remembered that he had not viewed the inscription steele yet. Qing Shui slowly set the flame level to low, and hurriedly walked towards the stone steele.</p>
  <p>On the top of the steele, the words Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were still engraved atop of it.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui continued glancing downwards. After the first level of the spatial realm has been unlocked, there would be an energy-enhancing tree which will bear 10 fruits every 100 years. Each of the fruits would be able to grant a human an additional 500 jin in strength, and would be able to be used as an alchemy ingredient. However, the effects would be useless after consumption of two.</p>
  <p>As for the 2nd level, there would be a agility-enhancing tree, which will bear 10 fruits every 100 years. Each of the fruits would be able to increase one’s original speed by 50%, and was able to be used as an alchemy ingredient. A person would only be able to enjoy the permanent increase in speed and agility of consumption of two fruits. However, if you eat an additional one after the consumption of two, then your speed will increase by another 50% for a time period of 15 minutes.</p>
  <p>The 3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was still locked……………………..</p>
  <p>“Wow, the agility-enhancing fruit, a free increase of speed and agility. After the permanent increase from the consumption of two of the fruits, I can still temporarily boost my speed after that!” Qing Shui’s eyes gleamed with unmatched excitement. His speed would truly be going against the heavens if he could increase it by 150%…</p>
  <p>The importance of the agility-enhancing fruit, Qing Shui was very clear. The martial arts under the Heavens all placed emphasis on speed. Speed, was also a form of strength!</p>
  <p>“Eating two would enable my speed to increase by one fold. Even if I’m not at the Xiantian level, even without breaking through to the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, this increase in speed would be sufficient for me to achieve victory in unexpected situations.”</p>
