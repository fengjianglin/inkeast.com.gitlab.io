 <p><strong>AST 1389 - Complete Victory, Cloud Flutter Organization, Coming Forth</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel that with them having lost six cultivators at once, the prowess of the Blood River Chariot Formation had weakened greatly.</p>
 <p>Che Qi felt the most gloomy about this. This young man was too demonic. To think that he could break through the Blood River Chariot Formation's defense. Moreover, he was very quick-witted to be able to launch a counter attack while using his opponents' power.</p>
 <p>When Che Qi came charging over once again, Qing Shui had already dodged. Qing Shui had no idea if this formation could stand up to the Phoenix Cry Sonic Attack, but he knew that Che Qi wouldn't give him this opportunity. Therefore, right now, Qing Shui could only move about and look for chances to breakthrough.</p>
 <p>"You only know how to escape. What's so good about that? If you dare, then come have a real fight with me head-on." Che Qi was extremely infuriated as he bellowed out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"You're already of such an old age. Should I say that you're naive or foolish? Do you really think so highly of yourself? You can choose to run as well. Are you thinking that you're very pitiful? A whole bunch of you are coming at me, yet you want me to fight you head-on? Who do you think you are? Do you think that I'll listen to you just because you asked for it? I don't have time to be squabbling with you here. My aim is to kill you." Qing Shui basically threw back what the old man said earlier right back at him.</p>
 <p>Che Qi was angered by what Qing Shui said and with his mouth agape for quite a while, he couldn't say anything at all.</p>
 <p>Endless fury turned into a stream of flames, charging into this body. Che Qi's saber trembled.</p>
 <p>Blood Ignition！</p>
 <p>The old man's arm suddenly turned very red and spots of blood were coming up. They then formed a line of blood, trickling onto the Blood Saber, before he then swung out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>A sword body that was like it was in a liquid state slashed out toward Qing Shui, emitting rumbling sounds that sounded extremely creepy. The deathly stench of blood was extremely strong and piercing.</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>Water counteracts fire!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's abilities were not too far off from Che Qi and he had killed six of them earlier, causing the Blood River Chariot Formation's prowess to be reduced a little. Due to this, even though Qing Shui felt that he might not be able to hurt Che Qi, he felt that he would have no problems in protecting himself.</p>
 <p>Monstrous Wave!</p>
 <p>Although water counteracts fire, Qing Shui's attack still couldn't fend it off entirely. However, it did weaken a large part of its prowess and when the remaining impact hit, Qing Shui's Nine Continents Mountain could easily fend it off.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already used his Paragon Heavenly Technique once and he was left with two more uses. Right now, Qing Shui felt that he could use it now.</p>
 <p>Other than Che Qi who had the Heavenly Technique, the next to most powerful of the were also at Grade Four False God. It was a pity that their strength were still a little bit off from 10 million sun and thus they didn't have the Heavenly Technique. Therefore, to Qing Shui, the damage they dealt wasn't that bad. After all, in principle, they couldn't even break through Qing Shui's defense.</p>
 <p>Shadowless Paragon!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that it was time and maybe the real battle should now be taking place. His speed instantly increased to be three times what it was and was so terrifying that even Che Qi felt that he couldn't catch up.</p>
 <p>Boom boom boom!</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger！</p>
 <p>With such a speed, Qing Shui was much more powerful than he was earlier. He managed to perform the Phoenix Finger with a high level of proficiency. If the opponents were to let down their guard, then someone would die at Qing Shui's hands.</p>
 <p>Losing one person would cause the prowess of the Blood River Chariot Formation to be reduced by a little. Right now, the Blood River Chariot Formation's prowess had been reduced by 30% in all. As Qing Shui became stronger and his opponents weaker, Qing Shui felt that the battle was getting increasingly easy.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's great increment in speed caused Che Qi to panic. He tried very hard to give chase, performing powerful martial techniques one after another. However, Qing Shui would manage to dodge them all skillfully. However, as he dodged each time, he would take away one more cultivator's life.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, another five people lost their lives!</p>
 <p>"Disperse the formation! Surround and attack him!" Che Qi was so angry that his entire body was trembling as he bellowed out.</p>
 <p>Out of the 18 people who had formed the Blood River Chariot Formation, Qing Shui had already killed 11 of them. Che Qi held back to not spurt blood as his eyes seemed as if they were spewing fire. He had a strong urge to cut Qing Shui into many pieces.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now thankful that he had learned the Phoenix Finger. Otherwise, he'd only be able to passively escape today. And he might not be able to do so successfully.</p>
 <p>Che Qi couldn't say a single word. On the contrary, as the battle went on, Qing Shui's fighting will got increasingly stronger, his actions became even more proficient and he was able to progress and retreat with great ease.</p>
 <p>"It's too unbelievable. To think that even though Miraculous Physician Qing is so young, he can fend off Che Qi's Blood River Chariot Formation..."</p>
 <p>"Miraculous Physician Qing's finger seal is so beautiful!" A lady looked at Qing Shui with a glow in her eyes.</p>
 <p>"This young man is too terrifying. After 10 or 20 more years, who would be able to stop him?"</p>
 <p>"These are already the experts from Che Clan's main branch. I wonder if Che Clan's foundation is able tolerate Miraculous Physician Qing... Will they take action? Will they request help from the Phoenix Dance Organization?"</p>
 <p>Linghu Yu looked at this scene from afar, his expression unchanging. However, great turbulent waves were surging in his heart. This young man wasn't someone they should offend. He was really a demonic existence.</p>
 <p>From afar, Yelang Qiankun also felt that he had lost the best opportunity. There was nothing to stop the decline of Yelang Clan anymore. When he saw Tianhe Renmo, he knew that this man would definitely cripple Yelang Wuji.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything and made his move. When his figure wasn't far from his opponent, he stomped down fiercely.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Shadowless Paragon could sustain for 15 minutes and 7.5 minutes had passed by. Qing Shui still had time and thus didn't wish to waste it. He attacked actively.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Nine Palace Laws!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Prison！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui instantly appeared behind the person at the very back. Phoenix Finger!</p>
 <p>Lingtai acupoint!</p>
 <p>This was also one of the most important acupuncture points. When the old man was struck by Qing Shui, he died immediately without having the chance to resist.</p>
 <p>The Blood River Chariot Formation was gone. Other than the three old men, the rest were not Qing Shui's match at all. While they appeared to be on par with Qing Shui's abilities, under the powerful Phoenix Finger, many of them died with just an attack of his finger.</p>
 <p>To bring a person down, one must first deal a blow to their confidence. Che Qi was overwhelmed with fury. Seeing how the people around him, who were his most trusted and were also a part of the Che Clan's foundation, falling one after another, the hatred yet helplessness that Che Qi felt made him want to stab himself.</p>
 <p>Without the Blood River Chariot Formation, after being weakened, Che Qi's strength was only around eight million sun... The other people's abilities were even weaker...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a strength of over five million sun and his defense was even so terrifying that it exceeded 1.5 million sun. Right now, he had unparalleled speed and defense.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was elusive as a ghost, performing the Phoenix Finger without any care.</p>
 <p>In less than the time required to take ten breaths, only Che Qi was left standing.</p>
 <p>18 people... 18 experts from the clan... and now, he was the only one left standing. Che Qi stood in midair in a daze as he looked at Qing Shui without a single word or a single movement.</p>
 <p>He couldn't accept this, he couldn't accept this even if he were to die. Even after he died, he would have to carry a tremendous humiliation. However, what could he do? Right now, he felt that this young man before him was like a tall mountain which couldn't be surpassed.</p>
 <p>By this time, Qing Shui clearly wouldn't hold back. He made his move. No matter what the other party did, there was no reason for Qing Shui to not kill him.</p>
 <p>Paragon Strike!</p>
 <p>Locking onto his opponent, Qing Shui dealt a fatal move.</p>
 <p>The Paragon Heavenly Technique's Paragon Strike was a type of combination between physical and mental strength. Therefore, the prowess of this attack surpassed 1.5 million sun. It was a pity that Qing Shui's physical strength was too weak. Otherwise, the prowess of the Paragon Strike would be even more terrifying.</p>
 <p>However, the prowess that was over double Qing Shui's strength caused Che Qi to disappear entirely.</p>
 <p>The place fell quiet, deadly quiet.</p>
 <p>This attack had stunned far too many people. How powerful was this attack to be able to blast Che Qi to his death, such that his body completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>It took only a short period of time for the news to spread out. However, Qing Shui didn't stay for too long. He entered the Imperial Cuisine Hall with the two ladies, Qing Jun and Tianhe Renmo. Earlier on, Yehuang Guwu had sealed up both Qing Jun's vision and hearing. She was now asleep.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo was extremely agitated now. He had no idea why he was so agitated. Looking at this young man who wasn't extremely tall but yet had an upright aura that seemed to reach all the way to the heaven. He was like a tall and powerful pine tree.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui and the group went back, some people in the crowd headed back as well. However, there were still others who refused to leave and were talking amongst themselves, as though they were waiting to watch the next show.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea what the Che Clan would do next. Although things had come down to this, he was still a little on the passive side. He wondered if the Phoenix Dance Organization would take action. He did felt a little uneasy.</p>
 <p>"The situation with the Che Clan isn't considered to one where there must be one party to die and is irrecoverable. However, I wonder if they will be conceited to come fight with me without asking for assistance." Qing Shui rubbed his head.</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui's thoughts were running wild, a female attendant walked in, bowed to Qing Shui and said, "Sir, someone's requesting for medical treatment. The person claims to be from "Cloud Flutter". The person says that you'll let them in if you hear this name."</p>
 <p>Cloud Flutter！</p>
 <p>It was true that Qing Shui had heard of this name before. He heard it through Linghu Yu in their conversation last time. Cloud Flutter was an agglomeration that was a competitor against the Phoenix Dance Organization. They could even be said to be at loggerheads with each other. While they were not as powerful as the Phoenix Dance Organization, the latter couldn't do anything to them either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea why they had come. After giving it some thought, he said, "Bring them to the sixth story."</p>
 <p>"Yes!"</p>
 <p>After the female attendant headed down, he headed toward the sixth story as well, in contemplation. He felt that the reason Cloud Flutter had came to look for him was definitely related to the events that had occurred today. Could it be that they wanted him to join them?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this possibility was very high but he won't be joining other organizations with the exception of the Demon Lord Palace. If that lady were to let him join, then he would do so without any hesitation. It wouldn't be long for him to be able to look for her. Before that happened, he must first get the things here settled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked very slowly. The fifth story all the way to the highest story were not open to the public. By the time Qing Shui slowly walked up all the way to the sixth story, he already saw two people there. There was a man and a lady.</p>
 <p>The man seemed to be middle-aged. Qing Shui knew that this man was very old but had actually used some Youth Retaining Arts. Although he seemed like a middle-aged man by his appearance, Qing Shui knew that this appearance couldn't be sustained for very long.</p>
 <p>The man was very handsome and manly and tall and his long figure exuded an explosive force. His eyes were very warm, giving the feeling that it was easy for one to believe his words.</p>
 <p>Compared to the man, the lady was clearly much younger. This was a mature lady who was in her 30s. Her dressing was sexy and mature, her hair tied up high. It complemented her snow-white neck to make it appear longer and sexier.</p>
 <p>Her eyes were very charming, yet had a feeling of one who was very persistence. Her upright nose appeared to be very sexy and her closed lips gave Qing Shui the feeling that this lady was very strong headed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea what the background of the Cloud Flutter Organization was but he knew that these two people before him could fully represent them. They were husband and wife, a couple that would make many people envious.</p>
