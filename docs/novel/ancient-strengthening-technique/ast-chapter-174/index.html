  <p><strong>AST 174 Peak of Xiantian, Canghai Mingyue!</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li shuddered embarrassedly and dropped that seductive smile!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have a few rooms available here. You can choose where you want to stay and I shall give you some bank notes later!” Huoyun inclined her cheeky face that was flushed with a mesmerising pink.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“”Haha, it’s great to finally meet an old acquaintance. It’s a wonder that I have food to eat and a place to stay and cultivate in. I am even spending the night with a beauty, or maybe even starting a family!” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Your mouth is so cheap. You are getting naughtier by the minute.” Huoyun turned red as she heard what Qing Shui had just said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh yeah. I suddenly realised that you’ve somehow become a stranger to me. Is it convenient right now to tell me of your glorious past and life experiences?” Qing Shui was still slightly astounded when he thought of Huoyun being the boss of Earthly Paradise. </span><span style>He was already in awe of Huoyun when he had met her back in Hundred Miles City. Now that he discovered her status and power here, he felt that her position matched up with her personality and aura.</span></p>
  <p><span style>She coquettishly casted a glance at Qing Shui, “What a glorious past and life experience. I only have my current success because of a wonderful master. She really doted on me.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>‘Your master is that awesome? You are really lucky. It seems like your Master is not someone ordinary, and must’ve been extremely powerful. To think that she could easily place you as the boss of Earthly Paradise.” Qing Shui initially wanted to say that Huoyun would’ve been fine even if she killed a group of profligate sons in the public. He decided to change his mind in the end.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Of course, she’s extraordinarily powerful. Hehe…!” Huoyun Liu-Li snickered, as her laughter could even be heard in her voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why, what’s so funny?” Qing Shui asked with a hint of depression.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Nothing, I just wanted to laugh. If you stayed in the Imperial Capital of Cang Lang Country for a few years, you wouldn’t need to ask me this question.” Huoyun teasingly glanced at Qing Shui with her pair of radiant Phoenix eyes. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why?” Qing Shui avoided Huoyun’s soul-stirring gaze as he asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Because my master is Canghai Mingyue!” Huoyun pridefully exclaimed with a dignified expression on her face. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Who? Canghai Mingyue? Is she famous? I’ve never heard of her before.” Qing Shui bewilderedly glanced at Huoyun.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I knew you wouldn’t have heard of her before. She is the only cultivator in Cang Lang Country to be at the peak of Xiantian! So now do you think my Master is powerful or not?!” Huoyun teased.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was truly dumbfounded this time around. On the surface, the strongest sect in the Cang Lang Country was the Skysword Sect. The strongest in the sect would be Baili Jingwei, someone at the 8th level of Xiantian. He had initially thought that Baili Jingwei was the strongest in Cang Lang Country. Even if he wasn’t, he should still be ranked equally with the other cultivators. Yet, who knew that there was someone even stronger than Baili Jingwei who was at the 8th level of Xiantian.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were 10 levels that one must attain in the Xiantian Realm before they can reach the Martial King Realm. It was extremely tough to increase one’s cultivation from level 1 to level 10. Especially at the 10th level, it was tremendously difficult to reach the peak The extreme Xiantian level consisted of the accumulation of an individual’s total strength from the 1st level to the 10th level. That was why it’s so horrendously tough. An example was Qing Luo who was at the peak of Houtian. He was stuck there for 20 whole years. Not only that, but in the Hundred Miles City, not many people could claim that they had a cultivation base at the peak of Houtian. Naturally, different types of cultivation arts and spiritual pills also played an effect in his breakthrough. Most of the time, the cultivators could only depend on their luck and destiny.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Not only with the Martial Commander, Xiantian, and Martial King after that, but even Martial Saint… Each and every realm was the same. Transcending realms were the toughest. However, it was all worth it because of the terrifyingly explosive increase in strength that the cultivator would gain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Which sect is your master from? Is her sect also in Cang Lang Country?” Qing Shui only recovered his wits after several moments, as he inquired.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, I don’t dare to ask too much about my Master’s business. However, she didn’t frequently appear here in Cang Lang Country. She told me that she would be flying around about in the Greencloud Continent, but I have no idea what her plans are.” Huoyun pulled some strands of hair behind her ear, revealing a sensuous ear that almost seemed to shine with a crystal-like glow.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How convenient it is to have a flying mount. I spent a total of over two months before I reached Cang Lang Country.” Qing Shui lamented.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yeah. My master said that she would gift me a Xiantian flying type adolescent beast, and wanted me to rear it properly. In three years, it should be capable of flight. At that time, I would send you anywhere no matter where you wanted to go, okay?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Okay, of course I’m okay. With a great beauty as my companion, how can I ask for anything more?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Huoyun Liu-Li, “…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stayed in a room similar to Huoyun Liu-Li’s. Although the night was still young, Qing Shui was comfortably lying on the soft bed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In his mind, Huoyun Liu-Li’s charming figure arose in his mind. That purple-colored beautiful silhouette… He was fantasizing about using his hands as he moved and felt each and every part of Huoyun’s body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Strength! I need more strength!” Qing Shui murmured as he entered into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
  <p><span style>With little to no effort on Qing Shui’s part, the medicinal herbs were growing exceptionally well in his realm. The black fishes and tortoises flooded the crystal pond, but the sense of vitality they emitted was even stronger than before. That Golden Medicinal Turtle laid motionless at the bottom of the crystal pond. The other black fishes and black tortoises didn’t dare to antagonise or provoke it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Qing Shui was ejected from his spatial realm, he suddenly thought of the Potential Fruit he had bought in the morning for an astronomical sum of money. After taking it out, it looked like the size of an apple. It was smooth, shiny, and without any apparent flaws. Agitated, Qing Shui used his strength to split the Potential Fruit in half as he contemplated about it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Huh, no seeds?” Qing Shui was extremely disappointed. If there were seeds, the 300,000 taels of silver would be worth it. If the effects were similar to the enhancing fruits that he was familiar with, Qing Shui would only be able to slightly increase his strength by consuming it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Money is tangible, so I can always earn it back.” Qing Shui gritted his teeth as he consoled himself.</span></p>
  <p><span style>300,000 taels of silver was spent to purchase this, so Qing Shui didn’t want to waste any part of it. Even if it’s poisonous, he would still eat it. Opening his mouth wide, he chomped down decisively on the fruit. It was fragrant, somewhat crispy, and had a lingering sweet taste to it! He finished the fruit in about three to five bites.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No reaction?” After waiting for half a day, Qing Shui still didn’t experience any change to his stats.</span></p>
  <p><span style>No change in strength, agility, endurance, sight, hearing… everything was the same as before. Could it be that the effects of a Potential Fruit were insufficient?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yet as Qing Shui was moping in depression, he discovered that his spiritual level had undergone a transformation. It was as if a barred paper window had been poked through. It allowed his spiritual senses to detect an accurate position of Huoyun Liu-Li in her room.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was as if he was personally inside her room, although he could see the silhouette of Huoyun. It was as though he was in a dream. The things he saw were coated in a layer of blurriness. Although he could see the general figure of her lying down on her bed, he could not see as clearly as when he used his physical eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“My spiritual senses strengthened by so much?” Qing Shui’s heart thumped wildly in happiness.</span><br></p>
  <p><span style>“The strengthening of Spiritual Sense means that my spirit had increased. For cultivators, the cultivation of the spirit was the most difficult thing to do. Many people were stuck at the border of Houtian and Xiantian because they had insufficient spirit. When Qing Shui had broken through to the 4th level of Ancient Strengthening Technique, his spirit was insufficient to support the 49th cycle of circulated Qi. It was only when he met the Golden Boar and was on the verge of death that his will to survive exploded. This caused his spirit to rise immensely, which led him to break through to Xiantian!</span></p>

Agitated, Qing Shui used his strength to split the Potential Fruit in half as he contemplated about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh, no seeds?” Qing Shui was extremely disappointed. If there were seeds, the 300,000 taels of silver would be worth it. If the effects were similar to the enhancing fruits that he was familiar with, Qing Shui would only be able to slightly increase his strength by consuming it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Money is tangible, so I can always earn it back.” Qing Shui gritted his teeth as he consoled himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>300,000 taels of silver was spent to purchase this, so Qing Shui didn’t want to waste any part of it. Even if it’s poisonous, he would still eat it. Opening his mouth wide, he chomped down decisively on the fruit. It was fragrant, somewhat crispy, and had a lingering sweet taste to it! He finished the fruit in about three to five bites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No reaction?” After waiting for half a day, Qing Shui still didn’t experience any change to his stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No change in strength, agility, endurance, sight, hearing… everything was the same as before. Could it be that the effects of a Potential Fruit were insufficient?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet as Qing Shui was moping in depression, he discovered that his spiritual level had undergone a transformation. It was as if a barred paper window had been poked through. It allowed his spiritual senses to detect an accurate position of Huoyun Liu-Li in her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he was personally inside her room, although he could see the silhouette of Huoyun. It was as though he was in a dream. The things he saw were coated in a layer of blurriness. Although he could see the general figure of her lying down on her bed, he could not see as clearly as when he used his physical eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My spiritual senses strengthened by so much?” Qing Shui’s heart thumped wildly in happiness.</span><br></p>
 <p><span style>“The strengthening of Spiritual Sense means that my spirit had increased. For cultivators, the cultivation of the spirit was the most difficult thing to do. Many people were stuck at the border of Houtian and Xiantian because they had insufficient spirit. When Qing Shui had broken through to the 4th level of Ancient Strengthening Technique, his spirit was insufficient to support the 49th cycle of circulated Qi. It was only when he met the Golden Boar and was on the verge of death that his will to survive exploded. This caused his spirit to rise immensely, which led him to break through to Xiantian!</span></p>
