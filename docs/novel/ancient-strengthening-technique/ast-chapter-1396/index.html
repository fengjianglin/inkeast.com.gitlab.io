 <p><strong>AST 1396 - Great Sacred Buddha Stone Leveled Up, Two Supreme Martial Artists</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was uncertain whether it was just a coincidence that the elder saw through his thoughts, but he hit the nail on the head with what Qing Shui was thinking.</p>
 <p>Originally, it was merely an idea but after what the elder said, he felt it was not simply an idea anymore, he should follow suit and not make a move. This way he would make the opponents be wary of his actions, the longer it took them the better it was for him.</p>
 <p>“Old man, what you said makes complete sense. Let’s just wait and see,” Qing Shui said while laughing.</p>
 <p>The elder looked at Qing Shui, with eyes carrying appreciation. He then followed up reiterating Cloud Flutter’s goodwill and left with the Yun Yijian couple. Qing Shui did not need their protection, when the elder thought about this he could only laugh.</p>
 <p>“Younger brother, in the meantime, I cannot help you. Let me return to the martial sect for a while,” Tianhe Renmo informed Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment, he knew that they had their own things to take care of. With his current abilities, he could battle Yelang Wuji without any issues. Moreover, Yelang Clan would not gang up on Tianhe Renmo when he was alone, after all they were aware of his relationship with Tianhe Renmo, so there was nothing to worry on that front.</p>
 <p>“Then, so be it, brother please be careful. If anything comes up please inform me,” Qing Shui said with a laugh.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Imperial Cuisine Hall was back to normal operations. However, the current Imperial Cuisine Hall was unlike how it was when he first arrived. Previously, the Aristocrat Clans did not even bat an eye at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, now they could not wait to establish a rapport with them.</p>
 <p>One thing that made Qing Shui happy, was that during treasure refinement, the Great Sacred Buddha Stone had risen in grade.</p>
 <p>Great Sacred Buddha Stone!</p>
 <p>Grade: One. Can be refined with pure energy. There was a limit on how many times it could be refined each day.</p>
 <p>Effect: Can be immersed in water. The longer it is immersed, the more spiritual power will be contained the in the water. Further, the spirit power will not disperse. For a certain grade, it can only affect a certain amount of water. Water that is under the Great Sacred Buddha Stone’s effect can be used in many ways such as drinking, irrigation, breeding animals… …</p>
 <p>Cannot recognize an owner!</p>
 <p>Can be upgraded!</p>
 <p>He had received the Great Sacred Buddha Stone previously in the Western Oxhe Continent. Though he had been using it constantly, because it did not have any grade, its area of effect was very small. He had not thought that after all this time it would finally break through to the first grade.</p>
 <p>Although it was the first grade, given that Sacred Objects were of the type of objects that had difficulty to break through at the beginning, the breakthroughs afterwards would be a lot easier. This made Qing Shui extremely happy. To break through one grade would mean that its effect would be more powerful than before. Grade ‘One’ was not only as simple as having one more than ‘zero’. The difference was like not having a wife, then marrying a good wife. The difference was as wide as the sky to the earth.</p>
 <p>That also described the gap between a zero grade and first grade Great Sacred Buddha Stone!</p>
 <p>This was great. Now he could use the Great Sacred Buddha Stone soaked water to water his herbal plants. He could also use it to refine drugs and so on… Even if it was only first grade, it had satisfying utility. Of course, the effect was not as good as a higher-grade stone, but he understood what it meant to be content with what he had. Otherwise, his mindset would be stuck on the fact that first grade was incomparable to second grade or third grade’s effect. Right now, what he needed was to make good use of the current grade of the Great Sacred Buddha Stone.</p>
 <p>Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was its normal self. Seven-headed Demon Dragon Spider and Thunderous Beast were all at their peak state, they were about to break through. However, it was also normal if it took eight to ten years before they broke through.</p>
 <p>The Hellfire Phoenix rested on a giant Chinese Parasol Tree. Since it recently broke through, its strength had not stabilized yet. Over the next while the Hellfire Phoenix’s strength will slowly stabilize, its Phoenix bloodline will also ignite causing significant increase in strength and battle prowess.</p>
 <p>If there was no battle, Qing Shui would allow the Hellfire Phoenix to cultivate within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. It had only recently evolved into the Hellfire Phoenix, there was inheritance that it needed to understand, absorb, and digest.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui longed for the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant to break through, once it broke through, he felt he could really unleash his abilities. Though he could show off his strength now, he had already waited for so long, he didn’t mind waiting for a bit longer.</p>
 <p>Three days passed by quickly, however Phoenix Dance Organization had no movements. Qing Shui also did not make a move. His focus was on taking care of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. These three days, he had issued several visitor cards. However, there were lots of rules attached to them. For example, each year he would only treat them once, whether they were would fully recover or not it would use up that year’s quota.</p>
 <p>Many people who possessed the visitor card would cherish this once a year chance. They would not use it to advance their cultivation but use it when their life was on the line. Martial artists were never short of critical and untreatable injuries, chronic diseases, etc.…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had forewarned them, if they did not cherish this chance, he did not mind letting them die. But if two were to appear at the same time, he did not mind extending his hand to help both. It would mostly be based on the situation and person.</p>
 <p>As time passed by, Qing Shui’s influence rose significantly. His name as the Miraculous Doctor was growing.</p>
 <p>Not long after he opened the shop, Qing Shui, who was at the top floor, felt two formidable auras. He thought in his mind, “perhaps the Phoenix Dance Organization finally made a move?”</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui quickly brushed away his thought. From the two auras, he felt that one of them was suddenly fading away. In his spiritual sense, these two small suns felt as bright as the fire of life.</p>
 <p>How formidable!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw what seemed to be dusk, just like the sunset.</p>
 <p>His life span was coming to an end!</p>
 <p>This was a sign when a life span was about to end!</p>
 <p>That was why Qing Shui thought these two were here seek medical aid. Which faction or power were these two powerful people from?</p>
 <p>Carrying a complicated mood, Qing Shui walked out directly!</p>
 <p>“Two elders, do you need some help?” The male servant near the door said with a smile.</p>
 <p>The two elders were dressed poorly but their clothes were very clean. Their plain clothing was not even worth wearing for normal civilians. They gave off the appearance of two ordinary old man.</p>
 <p>“Rumor has it that there is a Miraculous Doctor here, coincidentally we also really need a doctor right now.”</p>
 <p>“Two elders, do you have a visitor’s card? If not, you will have to wait for the walk-in times, which is three days away.” The male servant said courteously.</p>
 <p>“Visitor card? Second brother, let’s go, looks like this place is a fraud!”</p>
 <p>The elder that spoke had a voice that was aged, his tone was bleak, it did not carry any other thoughts.</p>
 <p>“Older brother, no matter what the rumors said that this place is very good. Let’s try it. You heard him, the Miraculous Doctor here also provides free walk-in examinations. He even cured many terminal illnesses. The visitor card was not to look down upon the poor, because the free walk-in does not allow the rich to participate, if they found out the rich participated they would not treat them ever again. When the rich need to be treated, they need to pay a very high price.”</p>
 <p>“However, the poor can’t always wait for the free walk-in treatments. What if they can’t wait?”</p>
 <p>“Usually those who can’t wait are treated immediately. Elders please come in.”</p>
 <p>At this very moment, Qing Shui walked out while smiling as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Physician Qing!”</p>
 <p>The male servant hurriedly said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hand to signal him to do other things.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Physician? At such a young age?” The older elder looked at Qing Shui with disbelief.</p>
 <p>They had actually heard of Miraculous Physician Qing being a young man, but they had thought he was middle-aged. Never in their minds did they think he was this young.</p>
 <p>“Don’t need to question, your life span is coming to an end, it can be treated,” Qing Shui laughed and lead them upstairs.</p>
 <p>Both elders were stunned again, they stared at Qing Shui in disbelief but proceeded to follow him upstairs.</p>
 <p>Halfway there, Yuan Su appeared.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, you should follow along and come check out his symptoms. In the future, you will need to participate in treatments like this, only those who can extend life spans are considered powerful doctors.”</p>
 <p>“You can really extend life spans?”</p>
 <p>The elder was in disbelief, if it was just a small bit of extension to life span, there would be many ways, but he was skeptical whether this young Miraculous Doctor was treating him as a normal person. This was the first time he had put himself in a situation to have his life span extended this way.</p>
 <p>In his situation, he had already sought out many doctors and alchemists. Moreover, he understood his own situation the best, thus he decided there was no need to seek any more help. However, he could not convince his brother otherwise, right now they were holding on to a sliver of hope for finding him a way to survive longer.</p>
 <p>Suddenly the elder saw that this young Miraculous Doctor had such strength and capabilities……</p>
 <p>“Old man, let me diagnose your pulse!”</p>
 <p>Once the elder collected himself, he extended his hand towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Diagnosing his pulse was only a formality, Qing Shui did not actually need it. However, Qing Shui decided to do it in hopes of sensing the same thing as Heavenly Vision Technique. He wanted to teach the feeling of pulse diagnosis to Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling was very strong, what Qing Shui used it for was to determine whether or not he could completely grasp the situation within the elder’s body with Meridian Knocking Soul Pulling.</p>
 <p>When an expert is on the scene, they would be able to distinguish whether the person was knowledgeable. The elder felt that this young Miraculous Doctor was magnificent, but he did not believe he could extend his life span. He just wanted his brother to drop the matter.</p>
 <p>“Elder, if I treat you now do you have any objections?” Qing Shui took out a box of Gold Needles.</p>
 <p>“None!”</p>
 <p>The other elder nodded.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, you should assist me. I will do acupuncture in the front and you can do it in the back. Just like how you do acupuncture normally.” Qing Shui laughed and handed Yuan Su a box of Gold Needles.</p>
 <p>The elder was very calm but the other elder on the side was panicking. “Stop, stop. I somehow feel like there’s something wrong here, you wouldn’t be using my brother as a guinea pig for that girl would you?”</p>
 <p>“It is the first time she has helped extend life spans, elder please don’t be too excited.” Qing Shui laughed and started acupuncture. Yuan Su was at the back of the elder and also started acupuncture.</p>
 <p>The elder was shirtless, his body was thin, the other elder wanted to stop the process.</p>
 <p>“Second brother, you need to trust the doctor,” the elder said calmly while his eyes were closed.</p>
 <p>The other elder bit his lip, then stopped. He carried a worried look on his face.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to worry, since your older brother’s life span is coming to an end regardless, if there was an accident there would be no loss but in the case where his life span is increased, then you profit! Don’t you think so?” Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Doctor has a point,” the elder with his eyes closed said happily.</p>
 <p>“…….” The elder on the side remained silent.</p>
 <p>Five Element Acupuncture, Constitution Nurturing, Nine Yang Golden Body Strengthening… When a pungent fishy fluid started dripping out, the elder that was awaiting on the side held a bowl to catch the dripping fluid.</p>
 <p>They stopped when half the bowl was filled. The elder went to clean the bowl himself. Qing Shui sprinkled fragrant scented powder in the room, then opened the window. The room was instantly filled with a sweet odor.</p>
 <p>“Older brother, how do you feel?” The elder that had returned asked excitedly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not say anything, he already knew there was no need for anything to be said. These two elders had terrifying strength. Qing Shui intended to heal them, to collect some good karma. At the same time, he wanted to send the two formidable martial artists away, especially since they were old monsters. If they had any weird obsession and decided to fight Qing Shui, then it would be a mess.</p>
