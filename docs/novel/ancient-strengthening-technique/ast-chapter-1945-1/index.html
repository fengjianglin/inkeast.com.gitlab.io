 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui observed this old man who was called the Old Monster Starry. The old man looked very thin and his back was a little hunched as well. He wore a standard looking robe. It was gray and didn't stand out. Even though the old man was already standing on the Sacred Royal Stage, Qing Shui still felt that the old man was just an ordinary old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Starry Immortal Palace was an existence that was on par with the Great Confucian Empire, the Canglan Empire, and the Moonwolf Empire. The Great Confucian Empire was located on the extreme West while the other three influences were located in the other three directions from the Great Confucian Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Starry Immortal Palace was located in the north and was the most mysterious faction of them all. It also faintly seemed to be the strongest of them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young man, how about joining our Starry Immortal Palace? You can state any conditions you desire." The old man grinned and looked at Qing Shui, giving off an eerie aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Qing Shui to notice this eerie feeling meant that this old man was definitely demonic. It seemed that his title, The Old Monster Starry, wasn’t just for show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Not interested." Qing Shui bluntly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We have a lot of beauties in our Starry Immortal Palace. Each of their beauty is unrivaled. If you were to join us, you can freely choose. If you have the ability, you can change once a day. No, it would be fine even if you were to change ten or twenty times a day." The Old Monster Starry continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui frowned. This old man was really frivolous despite being of such old age. Most importantly, it seemed that he didn't care about what others thought of him. He was speaking quite loudly and the people in the surroundings didn't seem to be too taken aback. However, quite a number of people revealed yearning expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I wonder if you have had fun with all of them already." Qing Shui smirked and retorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How's that possible? I'm already getting on in age and can't compare with youngsters. I don't have any interests in this area anymore as well." Old Monster Starry said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when one had reached his age could they openly declare to be old, couldn't do it anymore and have lost interest in women. Younger people wouldn't dare to do the same and would have said that they could handle it, even if they couldn't.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How about it? Why don't you consider my suggestion?" Old Monster Starry once again revealed that eerie smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head. "I don't like those lascivious sects."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Monster Starry's eerie triangular eyes rolled back. This young man was really sinister to dare to use this kind of word. How could the Old Monster Starry possibly be saying such stuff if it wasn't because he wanted to tempt Qing Shui into joining his sect? Moreover, he was only saying this on a whim. If Qing Shui really were to join then he would come out with a few ladies to shut him up. Although Old Monster Starry enjoyed a high status in the Starry Immortal Palace, he wouldn't dare to do such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young man, you're really out to make a sport of it. Why not do it this way? The party who loses today will unconditionally agree to a condition of the other party. What do you think?" Old Monster Starry's triangular eyes swirled around as he looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, "Not interested."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Monster Starry started becoming even more aggrieved, his triangular eyes suddenly became very fierce as he glared at Qing Shui, "I thought you had guts, but it seems that you're soft down there as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, "Mine is definitely not soft. However, earlier on, a certain someone was saying that he can't do it anymore and isn't interested in women. If there's someone who has gone soft, it'd have to be you. Isn't that right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Monster Starry's rolled his eyes and said, "Alright, I won't continue this countless conversation anymore. Come on. Let's have a spar. We'll see how things go after someone loses."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I won't lose. You're getting on in age, so you can make the first move." Qing Shui moved his right leg backward by half a step and put up a pose, as if he was accepting the other party's attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Monster Starry smiled eerily and then, his figure suddenly multiplied to three. Each of his arms had an azure three-feet long snake with golden strips coiling around them, glimmering. Their tongues were where the Old Monster Starry's wrist was at as they flicked their bright red tongues in and out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The snakes were only three-feet long but their tongues were half a foot long, appearing very strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Azuregold Snakes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew about them. It was a mutated beast from the ancient times. They weren't big but were exceptionally venomous. Moreover, their bodies were remarkably tough as well and they were very agile. They were extremely dangerous existences. It was said that one of these could kill a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Qing Shui's memories, the Azuregold Snake</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that could kill a dragon was over ten meters long and was as thick as one's lower thigh. However, these two snakes should still be lacking in cultivation. Those that were three-feet long were considered to have matured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This small creature was undoubtedly powerful and vicious. Qing Shui liked them a lot, but he needed to be careful now. If he wasn't careful and was struck by its venom, he could turn into a golden statue. It would be as if he was plated with a layer of gold. This was also the reason why the snake's name had 'gold' in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now realized that his Heavenly Vision Technique was really a Divine grade battle technique. This was especially after the recent breakthrough. Another thing was his own physique, the Nine Yang Physique made him invulnerable to poison. However, he would rather not risk trying the venom of this Azuregold Snake recklessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chaotic Snake Dance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Monster Starry's arm swung about strangely, striking out one seal after another at a great speed. The three Old Monster Starry instantly produced a myriad of snake shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss hiss...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The piercing sounds seemed as if they were going to break a hole through the sky. Qing Shui never would have thought that snakes were capable of making such loud noises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Qing Shui sensed a strange sound that darted into his mind as if it was physical. His eyes opened wide. This old man was really vicious. He wanted to turn Qing Shui into an idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, the Yin-Yang Image in Qing Shui's consciousness spun rapidly, negating the destructive sound. At that moment, a layer of dense rain fell from the sky. The rain was azure in color and extremely brilliant. The more brilliant the color, the more poisonous it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda but was still unable to fend off such an attack and ended up being vulnerable to the incoming poison. However, Qing Shui's physique was resistant to poison and sound-typed attacks seemed to be ineffective against him as well. Until now, Qing Shui still didn't know what type of attack sounds belonged to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It should be spirit energy attacks. After all, Qing Shui could negate 70% of spirit energy attacks.</span></p>

It was as if he was born to suffer beatings as his ability to withstand pain and injuries was far too strong.</span></p>

It wasn't just his resistance to attacks that were strong, but his ability to inflict damage as well. As the saying goes, if one wanted to beat others, one must first be able to withstand beatings. If one wanted to become a grandfather, one must first become a grandson.</span></p>

After all, illusions were still illusions. After images wouldn't stay for long. Qing Shui regained his composure and moved to the side to dodge the Azuregold Snakes' attacks, striking with his palm.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qing Shui didn't know what the reason was. Since the opponent wasn't attacking, Qing Shui would force him to.</span></p>

It was the domineering aspect of the Dragon-capturing Hands and Qing Shui had been hard at work, training with it. Moreover, the Dragon-capturing Hands' domineering aspects were unrivaled. It could break the opponent's great skill, such as interrupting Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques that were about to be unleashed.</span></p>

Under a situation where both parties had a drastic difference in their abilities, it would only hurt the target. However, if the opponent was around the same level, there was a certain chance for them to be crushed to death.</span></p>

After all, it was only a certain chance for the opponent to be crushed to death and the chance itself wasn't high.</span></p>

He hadn’t expected this young man to capture him. Old Monster Starry excelled in speed and he felt as if it was useless no matter where he hid. If he were to know that this martial technique was sure to hit, he wouldn't have found it strange.</span></p>
