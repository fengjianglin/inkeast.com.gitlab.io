 <p><strong>AST 1088 - Taming, Fastest Way To Riches Is To Kill And Rob</strong></p>
 <p>Clack! Roar!</p>
 <p>The Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape was immediately knocked out by Qing Shui’s Primordial Flame Whip, causing the ape to roar as it struggled to gain momentum in mid-air. However, the ape quickly regained its composure and rushed back quickly towards Qing Shui with a more infuriated demeanor than before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also shocked. The strike resistance of the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape was indeed powerful. Even though he hadn’t used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and the Buddha’s True Eye, he was still able to unleash 200,000 stars of spiritual energy attack against the ape. However, all he could get out from the beast was a loud shriek.</p>
 <p>Some demonic beasts were known to be powerful only due to their physical strength. For example, the Stone Rock Beast had a body as sturdy as a rock, so it would seem appropriate to suggest that the physical defense of this beast was superior. However, if one were to use the same amount of power with a spiritual energy attack, the Stone Rock Beast would be easily defeated within seconds.</p>
 <p>As one’s power surpassed 5,000 stars, their spiritual energy would receive a boost as well. During the cultivation of any particular skill, the usage of spiritual energy would be a vital element to their training. However, most skills require the physical strength of a cultivator to be powerful rather than their spiritual energy. This was due to the difficulty of cultivating spiritual energy. In any case, spiritual battle techniques were rare to come across, making the cultivation of spiritual energy not prioritized.</p>
 <p>With the exception of a few specialized spiritual energy cultivation and a few cultivators who spent most of their time cultivating spiritual energy, these people would always be lacking in terms of physical strength and speed. So in other words, each aspect of cultivation had their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
 <p>As for the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape, Qing Shui suspected that it might have the Dragon Bloodline in its veins. Thus, not only was its body as strong as steel, it had an ample amount of spiritual energy that could even contend with its physical strength. Yiye Jiange’s Seven Headed Crystal Beast was also a mutant. Even though its spiritual energy was superior to its physical strength, upon reaching that level, it had its own protective battle techniques. In any case, it had a strong body that was only weaker when compared to its spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, keep holding it off. I will talk with it in the meantime.” Luan Luan chuckled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled back and gave her a nod. It was still relatively easy trying to hold off the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape. He lashed out with his Primordial Flame Whip against the ape multiple times again, with the beast shrieking in pain each time it was struck with the whip.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan opened her mouth and made some strange sounds. Qing Shui knew that Luan Luan was talking to the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape. However, judging from the angry grunts made by the ape, he could tell that this giant beast was disagreeing with what Luan Luan was trying to relay.</p>
 <p>With a wave of her hand, Luan Luan summoned the Golden Jiao King to her side. Then with another wave, she called out the Spirit Deer as well. After that, she looked at the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape and said something again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t understand a word she was saying. As long as he was able to keep the distance between Luan Luan and the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape further apart while keeping it within his reach, it would be fine. He felt that Luan Luan was trying to entice this gigantic beast and that she was trying to demonstrate something about herself.</p>
 <p>The Mystic-Armored Ice Ox, Earth Devouring Mice and the recently tamed demonic beasts were called out simultaneously by Luan Luan, which caused the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape to finally stopped moving. The ape looked at Luan Luan in the eyes before turning towards Qing Shui with a more frightened gaze.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had an inkling that Luan Luan was using intimidation to show the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape her power. He could tell from the ape’s eyes how scared it was of her. However, Luan Luan seemed to be going forward with her enticement to the beast as she took out the medicinal pills that he had given to her earlier.</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan, tell it that you are the Heart of Seven Orifices and that you are naturally gifted. Tell it that you will accomplish bigger things in the future and let it know that choosing you is the best choice for it…..” Qing Shui knew for sure that Luan Luan would tell the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape these things but he couldn’t help but remind her what she should do just in case.</p>
 <p>“ I did, otherwise it wouldn’t settle down like this. The ape has already been wavered by my words. Just watch me.” As soon as Luan Luan was done, she called out three Windfire Wolves with two of them being six-headed.</p>
 <p>This was Luan Luan’s trump card. The current Six-Headed Windfire Wolves were comparable to this Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape in terms of power. Of course, this ape would definitely surpass the strength of even the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast once it had break through to its adulthood.</p>
 <p>It was because of its growth that Qing Shui took a fancy to the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape. This was also a great opportunity for Luan Luan as she was the Heart of Seven Orifices. Even so, she wasn’t allowed to tame any demonic beast as she liked. Even though the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape was interested in her, it would not allow itself to be tamed because her power was still far from impressive to these powerful demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>However, this ape who was almost at its adulthood was different. The beast wasn’t an adult yet, so the intelligence of its mind was still mediocre at best. But with the current situation, the ape was rendered senseless even further, which was why the beast had wavered after it saw the powerful Six-Headed Windfire Wolves following Luan Luan and the fact that she has something that could benefit its power…..</p>
 <p>After the last stream of Beast Tamer spiritual energy was absorbed by the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape’s mind, the beast was officially tamed by Luan Luan successfully.</p>
 <p>Beast Tamers would typically tame demonic beasts with different types of approaches. The first type of approach would require no contracts or agreements, just like how Qing Shui managed to tame his Five-Headed Demonic Spider. It was the same situation for Luan Luan and some of her demonic beasts. This type of approach could cause the demonic beast to betray the trust of the Beast Tamer. However, this was a fair approach—or to be exact, this was a team between a man and a beast striving for a common goal.</p>
 <p>In addition to that, Qing Shui and his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, as well as Wenren Wushuang and her Golden Cauldron Spirit Crane, were examples of a taming approach that utilized medicinal pills as a contract with the beasts. This approach would benefit the owner the most. However, the medicinal pills used to tame demonic beasts were rare. This was because these pills were high in quality but low in quantity.</p>
 <p>And then there was Luan Luan’s recent approach with the Gigantic Armored Draconic Beast, which was planting a part of her spiritual energy inside its head. The effect of this approach was more or less similar to that of using medicinal pills but this would either require either the cooperation of the demonic beasts in question or for one to force the demonic beast into submission. If the demonic beast was forced to be tamed, then the power of the beast would not match up with that of the Beast Tamer. The disparity of power would be great in this instance, so taming a demonic beast of such a level would be meaningless. Beast Tamers would only use this type of taming process for demonic beasts that were more powerful than themselves. However, such circumstances would be extremely costly but it would be ideal to catch one successfully. This method might not be fair, which was why this approach was difficult for most Beast Tamers.</p>
 <p>Using medicinal pills wasn’t fair either but one could also seek assistance from others to force the demonic beast into submission. However, this type of taming process would be useless—or rather, seeking assistance was a futile effort—as the demonic beast would only be tamed successfully when it had decided to submit willingly.</p>
 <p>Just like this Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape—it was ‘tricked’ into being tamed by Luan Luan. Demonic beasts would prefer the taming process to be fair and equal. That way, they would have more freedom in their decision to choose their owner.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan’s method in taming the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape wasn’t purely beneficial for her, it also held some disadvantages. This method would require Luan Luan to use her spiritual energy to tame the beast. And should the Gigantic Armored Draconic Beast die in any circumstance, Luan Luan would be affected as well and she would be wounded in the process.</p>
 <p>The strong point of the Heart of Seven Orifices was the ability to communicate with demonic beasts. Through this method of taming, the amount of spiritual energy needed was minimal. Most importantly, demonic beasts would always become closer to her, forging a deeper bond in an instant.</p>
 <p>For safety purposes, she decided to use this ‘unfair’ method in taming the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape. She used the same method to tame the strongest Earth Devouring Mouse, the Five-Headed Windfire Wolf as well as two of the Six-Headed Windfire Wolves. However, the rest of her demonic beasts were tamed using the fair method instead.</p>
 <p>The fair method didn’t necessarily mean that demonic beasts would be easily ‘settled’. In fact, most demonic beasts would not betray their owner once they had confirmed that they would work together as a team. The demonic beast would only betray their owner during a special situation. Some would do so due to their nature as a cunning beast too.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan was destined to be strong and she would have a lot of demonic beasts by her side. As long as a number of her strongest demonic beasts were extremely loyal to her and were able to intimidate the rest, then everything would be fine.</p>
 <p>After she had managed to tame the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape, she proceeded to feed it a bunch of medicinal pills and the Hallow Pellets immediately. The ape was already at the peak of its power, so it would eventually broken through to adulthood in no time regardless of its condition.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan feeding it medicinal pills was like igniting the fuse of a dynamite. In an instant, the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape took a leap and became as big as a small mountain, increasing its power by two folds. The ape was still on par with the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast. In terms of the resistance, however, the Gigantic Armored Draconic Ape was a step superior to the Crystal Beast itself.</p>
 <p>Due to its surge of power, the bond between Luan Luan and the ape was further enhanced. This made Luan Luan happy and pleased as the bond between a Beast Tamer and a demonic beast was the most important aspect of the beast taming process. The stronger the bond was, the greater their teamwork would be.</p>
 <p>“My girl, we should go back now.” said Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Alright, daddy!”</p>
 <p>Luan Luan wasn’t a child anymore, so she would naturally understand everything that Qing Shui had done for her. Her impression of Qing Shui was more significant than that of Yiye Tian. She had more of less understood Qing Shui’s contribution to her growth, even from when she was just a little girl. Because of that, she had determined that her greatest pride was having Qing Shui as her father.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps and brought Luan Luan back to the camp. He was slowly fulfilling his wishes, lessening the burdens in his heart in the process. He was becoming more at ease after watching the members of Qing Clan slowly becoming stronger and powerful.</p>
 <p>When they arrived at the camp, the ladies had already finished their preparations for dinner. Upon seeing Qing Shui and Luan Luan back from their adventure, they requested to see what kind of demonic beast she had tamed. Luan Luan had no choice but to call out the Giant Armored Dragon Ape she had caught.</p>
 <p>The colossal and overbearing presence of the Giant Armored Dragon Ape had the ladies drowned in envy. Unfortunately for them, this was Luan Luan’s talent. None of them would be able to learn how to tame a demonic beast like her. Yiye Jiange, on the other hand, had a great starting point as a Beast Tamer for being able to claim the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast as her own. But ever since then, she didn’t have any thoughts on taming other demonic beasts. In any case, taming demonic beasts wasn’t a simple matter that could be achieved in just one day.</p>
 <p>The evening sky could be considered as the prettiest view of any time of the day. They had set up their tents in a vast and boundless field of grasses somewhere further away from the messy battlefield earlier.</p>
 <p>Everyone had a good time eating their dinner. After they were done, Qing Shui went to a nearby concealed area and went straight into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable was still outside the realm to alert Qing Shui should anything dangerous happen around the tent area.</p>
 <p>Upon entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui immediately went to check on the Interspatial Silk Sachets he had thrown in earlier. Most of the sachets had nothing meaningful but some had medicinal ingredients that were quite decent for refining medicines. On a side note, the medicinal pills that he had gathered from the silk sachets could be shared among his close family and the other members of the Qing Clan as well.</p>
 <p>Amongst the sachets belonging to Beitang Lie and the powerful Elders, he had managed to acquire six bottles of low grade Sacred Beast Pills. Qing Shui was elated to the point that his hands shook just by holding them. He initially thought that Sacred Beast Pills he had were too small in quantity. Now that he had six bottles of them, he still thought that the pills weren’t a lot but it was at least enough to allow the members of Qing Clan to become stronger than ever.</p>
 <p>The reason that the Lion King’s Ridge was so powerful must have something to do with these low grade Sacred Beast Pills. In addition to that, they were all considered as Beast Tamers, so it wouldn’t be difficult for them to become powerful with years of accumulated experiences.</p>
 <p>After gaining additional bottles of Sacred Beast Pills, Qing Shui figured that he would have a better time arranging and separating the pills for his close family. Hai Dongqing would receive one, as the others already had demonic beasts of their own. Even though the demonic beasts weren’t that strong, they were still powerful nonetheless. Hai Dongqing was the only member without any demonic beasts, so he decided that he would take some time tomorrow to help her capture a power demonic beast. Killing the members of the Lion King’s Ridge was worth the six bottles of Sacred Beast Pills found in their Interspatial Silk Sachets.</p>
 <p>The remaining five bottles and the three bottles he had initially possessed had accumulated to about eight bottles in total. Qing Shui decided to give them out appropriately once they have gone back to the Qing Clan. That should be about it. These few bottles of low grade Sacred Beast Pills had helped Qing Shui quite a lot. The only thing he was worried about was his mother—whether she could tame a powerful demonic beast on her own with her current strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stored the low grade Sacred Beast Pills and continued to look at the remaining items. The first thing he saw made a smile curl up on the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>Lion King's Imprint!</p>
 <p>This could be considered as a decent battle technique of the Lion King’s Ridge if this was the cultivation method of the Lion King's Imprint.</p>
 <p>“Mm, there’s more!” Qing Shui continued to read below. Acquiring the battle techniques of the Lion King’s Ridge was an excellent thing for Qing Shui right now, as he would be able to develop a deeper understanding of the affairs of the Lion King’s Ridge. If he managed to destroy the Lion King’s Ridge in the future, then he could allow the members of the Qing Clan and the Heavenly Palace to learn some of the Lion King’s Ridge mastery techniques. Moreover, he had a feeling that the Lion King’s Ridge would be in possession of more of these low grade Sacred Beast Pill, which he could acquire for his family as well.</p>
