 <p><strong>AST 1303 - White Tiger... The Location of the Lady's Five Elements Divine Flag, Would He Be The Side To Be Pushed Down?</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't understand why the lady was asking this. Every time he saw her, he felt that she wasn't practical and he didn't know how he should reply.</p>
 <p>"Martial Aunt, someone of your age can't be joking with me like this," Qing Shui said helplessly. This was the first time he was given a great headache and felt scared of an exceptionally beautiful lady. Back when he had encountered the Demon Lord and was on the verge of death, he hadn't felt scared. He didn't have the same feeling as now.</p>
 <p>The lady let out a crisp laugh that belonged to a mature woman.</p>
 <p>"I told you that I'm not that old. If you are to say that I'm old again, I'll teach you a lesson. Alright, I'll stop teasing you. But you've taken advantage of me again. Do you believe that you're the first person to have taken advantage of me?" The lady looked at Qing Shui curiously.</p>
 <p>If it was in the past, Qing Shui would never have believed it. It was because he felt that this lady was a little loose. Although she appeared to look pure, he had the feeling that she was innately a loose person. However, when he saw out that she was a White Tiger, he felt that there really weren't many men who could have their way with her.</p>
 <p>That amazing technique... The Duo Cultivation Technique in Qing Shui’s possession, had specially mentioned that there were a few ‘lethal weapons’ in the world. The White Tiger was one of the most lethal ones. Even ordinary rulers of a royal family wouldn't be able to withstand that ferocious aura.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui came back to his senses. He knew that anything he said now wouldn't be suitable at this moment. It was best for him to shut up.</p>
 <p>"Do you hate me now?" The lady looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"No, why would I?" Qing Shui quickly said. Apparently, it was bad to remain silent as well.</p>
 <p>"Alright, everything is over now. It's late. If you don't wish to stay here for the night, then leave," the lady said as she looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>"I'll leave immediately!" Qing Shui quickly said.</p>
 <p>"Come back. You're really leaving? It's late now. You can leave tomorrow. Don't worry, I won't be eating you up. I don't want to be bringing you harm." When the lady saw Qing Shui turn to leave, she grabbed him back angrily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned and looked at the lady. This time around, her gaze was extraordinarily clear. He nodded, "Then I'll have to trouble Martial Aunt."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had decided to stay because of what her words, that she didn't want to bring him any harm. Qing Shui felt that after so such a long time of contact, this was the warmest thing that she had said to him.</p>
 <p>He felt that this lady wasn't really so loose. Tantai Xuan had said that he was the only man her Master had teased before. It was just that she wasn't aware of the extent that her Master had teased Qing Shui. Her Master had even grabbed his penis. Qing Shui couldn't understand...</p>
 <p>"Then I'll go catch a few fish and cook something up!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"That's good too. Let's go, I'll go with you."</p>
 <p>With that, the lady pulled Qing Shui and left the bamboo building. The lady appeared very natural and was even holding onto Qing Shui's hand. Qing Shui had wanted to dodge but eventually decided against it. Even he didn't understand what were the feelings he was having now.</p>
 <p>He knew that the lady wouldn't think of pestering him. Because with her physique, she was destined to not be able to enjoy the feeling of sex. It could be because of this that the lady would act like this. However, why did she choose him? Was it because he had potential?</p>
 <p>However, even if it was because he was seen to have potential... She was far too accurate in her choice. With Qing Shui's physique, he would definitely be able to have sex with her with no repercussions at all. What would she do if she were to find out about his physique? Just thinking about it made Qing Shui feel strange.</p>
 <p>It was because he felt that if the lady were to know that he could do it, she would definitely push him down.</p>
 <p>Holding hands and walking side-by-side, they headed toward the beach that wasn't far away. The sun was setting, and there was only a little bit of lingering light left. The sea breeze was very soft and felt very refreshing. There was no stench at all.</p>
 <p>The environment here couldn't be compared to the places from Qing Shui's previous life. He was holding the hand of an exceptional beauty. Only then did Qing Shui notice that the lady wasn't wearing any shoes, baring her exquisitely beautiful feet.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, when are you going to head to the other three continents?" The lady looked into the distance and said slowly.</p>
 <p>"When I can fix the location of the Five Elements Divine Flag in the other three continents," Qing Shui gave it some thought and replied. Two years should be sufficient. It would be fine as long as he could set the point on any one of the other three continents.</p>
 <p>"Mmm. Oh, right, Qing Shui, a location has also appeared on my Five Elements Divine Flag," the lady happily said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Oh? So fast?"</p>
 <p>"It's not as fast as yours. What's so strange about it?" The lady looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't reply. He had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He didn't know if the lady also had some amazing items.</p>
 <p>"Where did you set the location at?" Qing Shui hoped that she didn't set the location on the Central Continent as well. However, the Central Continent was the best location. Therefore, he felt that the chances of her setting it there was very high.</p>
 <p>"I've set it to be at the Western Oxhe Continent. Oh, right, my Five Elements Divine Flag can only be set on the Western Oxhe Continent," the lady said, unable to understand this either.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very happy. After giving it a long thought, he eventually felt that the problem should be because it would be dependent on where they had stayed for most of their life. Or it could also be related to the husband and wife relationship the Five Elements Divine Flags had. For example, after the location of the Five Elements Divine Flag (Husband) was set in one place, then the Five Elements Divine Flag (Wife) couldn't be set on the same place.</p>
 <p>The more Qing Shui thought about it, the more he felt that this was possible. It was because the words husband and wife weren't just meant for show. Most husband and wife couples would be together. Therefore, there was no need for them to be specifically set on the same location.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Qing Shui didn't know if he should feel happy or otherwise. The next location he would set on would either be in the five continents or the other three continents. What grade would he cultivate the Five Elements Divine Flag to? Qing Shui felt hopeful. It would be best if he could set a location in each of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>Maybe in the future, they might be able to set them on the same location or locations that weren't too far from each other. That might be something possible.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then it'll be easy if I were to wish to return to the Western Oxhe Continent in the future. I'll be able to first look for Martial Aunt, and then get you to bring me back to the Western Oxhe Continent," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"It's good for you, but I won't be able to go anywhere," the lady grumbled.</p>
 <p>"How could that be? When the opportunity arises, you can also take a look around the five continents," Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>"Mmm. If there's time, I'll go there and take a look. I haven't been to the five continents before."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Pure Gold Fishing Rod and stepped into the water with the lady. They went to a slightly deeper spot.</p>
 <p>Back then, he had managed to catch the Triple-eyed Grass Green Frog when he was with Di Qing. Right now, there were also some in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. There was also some Crystal Lions which he had caught in the Jade Sea in the past. The crystal physiques that they produced were also supreme treasures and he had accumulated and used a number of them. Most importantly, in the pond in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, which had already turned into a small lake, there was already a group of Crystal Lions. The Crystal Lions and the Triple-eyed Grass Green Frogs were both creatures that were amphibious. However, the Crystal Lions were more beautiful compared to the Triple-eyed Grass Green Frogs. It was a pity that they weren't demonic beasts and were considered to be treasure beasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had many medicinal pills. For example, he had medicinal pills that strengthened one's muscles and arteries, bones, strengthened one's foundations, and increased one's talent. These were no longer something that the ones he had in the past could be compared with. Their effect had increased by many times over. Their names were also changing. These were the effects of the crystal physiques.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, your fishing rod isn't bad!" The lady looked at the Pure Gold Fishing Rod in Qing Shui's hand.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, it's still acceptable. It has helped me catch quite a number of good stuff," Qing Shui smiled as he replied.</p>
 <p>"Oh? What did you catch? For you to say that they are good stuff, it seems that this fishing rod is really quite good."</p>
 <p>"Are Triple-eyed Grass Green Frogs and Crystal Lions counted?"Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Yes, of course they are!" The lady was very astonished.</p>
 <p>"Oh, right. The first time I came here, I also caught a pair of Longevity Fish." Right now, there were some things that Qing Shui could say. Moreover, this lady wasn't really considered an outsider.</p>
 <p>"Longevity Fish and there were two of them?" The lady looked at Qing Shui, her expression was very strange.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Xuan`er and Ruyan have both seen that." Qing Shui couldn't understand why the lady was so astonished.</p>
 <p>The part that made her astonished was that not only could Longevity Fish increase the user's lifespan, it also represented devotion in a relationship. People who could catch them were people who were devoted in love and had the strongest feelings toward love and sex. Other than these people, if one were to catch some, they would be able to get a few ladies in the vicinity to fall in love with them. There was even a huge chance for them to become husband and wife or even soulmates.</p>
 <p>For there to be two... Did one of them represent Xuan`er? Then who did the other one represent?</p>
 <p>Ruyan was already his wife back in the five continents, so she wasn't counted.</p>
 <p>The lady thought of herself but quickly shook her head. It was impossible. In this life, she was destined to live a lonely life for all eternity. Even if she were to get a man, she would just be bringing harm to him.</p>
 <p>"What about it? Is something wrong?" Qing Shui saw that the lady seemed to be very astonished, even more so than she was previously. She even seemed as if her soul had left her.</p>
 <p>"Nothing. Let's fish. I really want to eat something that you cooked."</p>
 <p>The other time, she had tried the food Qing Shui had prepared back in the manor that he had purchased.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Qing Shui caught a soft-shelled turtle with a black shell. The most important thing was that not only was such soft-shelled turtles delicious, they were also extremely nutritious. He then caught a few grass carps, prawns, and crabs. When he felt that it was about enough, Qing Shui stopped.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then took out tools and started work on the beach directly.</p>
 <p>The beach here could be said to be very clean. The air was humid; the weather was pleasant. Stepping on the sand barefoot felt especially comfortable. In the distance, there were even gulls, but they didn't come near the bamboo building. Therefore, there weren't any signs of bird feathers or bird shit and other stuff.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a wonderful fragrance flowed out. He made four to five dishes, soup, and even grilled some food. The seafood was fresh to begin with. In addition to Qing Shui's ingredients, the taste could be considered to be truly amazing.</p>
 <p>"Right, can you teach me that technique of yours? The one that both Xuan`er and Ruyan knows," the lady asked as she ate.</p>
 <p>"Oh... I don't teach that technique to outsiders, and only to male and not females, to wives and not sisters..." Qing Shui knew that she was referring to the Nine Palace Steps. Seeing the lady's peaceful appearance, Qing Shui couldn't help but tease her.</p>
 <p>The lady didn't say anything but just continued to eat.</p>
 <p>"Are you angry? I was just kidding. I'll teach you later." Qing Shui had always been used to the lady's irregular actions. For her to suddenly act this way, he really wasn't used to it.</p>
 <p>"Oh, I'm not angry, I just went into a daze..." The lady chuckled.</p>
 <p>After dinner, Qing Shui started to teach her the One Origin Steps and the Duality Steps. The lady's foundation was very good, she was knowledgeable, and was able to pick things up especially quickly. The lady's display of the technique seemed to show a similar aptitude to Qing Ming.</p>
 <p>In the process of teaching, it was inevitable for there to be physical contact. However, the lady didn't seem to mind it at all. Moreover, Qing Shui had spaced out several times. It wasn't because he wasn't mentally strong enough but that the lady's beauty was undeniable. Furthermore, for most of the time, the lady was more proactive than Qing Shui. It seemed as if Qing Shui was the one being teased and taken advantage of. Therefore, he felt that it was strange.</p>
 <p>"Martial Aunt, do you know if there is a Buddha Sect, Lion King's Ridge, and Beitang Clan in the Western Oxhe Continent?"</p>
