  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 519 - Breakthrough of the “Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs”, Thousand Hammer Technique Heaven Realm</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held her hands tightly…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li raised her head and saw the gentle look in Qing Shui’s eyes, a sweet feeling arose in her heart and she slightly lowered her reddened face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That moment caused Qing Shui’s heart to be itchy, however, since there were so many people around, Qing Shui could only massage the jade-like hand he held.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After dinner, Qing Bei kept shouting out to ride the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, the other members of the three generations of the Qing Clan also heckled on, everyone was happy to see that Qing Shui had recovered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Of course, Qing Shui was also happy beyond comparison, logically, he should be the happiest, those who were happy as well were the girls, after all, they knew that he only had three years of life left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The potential of humans was limitless, Qing Shui felt that this terrifying potential could only be exhibited under such a situation. If not for these kinds of situations, Qing Shui might not have embarked on this path, and just like his mother, sister and Huoyun Liu-Li said, living a plain peaceful life would not necessarily be a bad thing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, it is comfortable sitting on this!” Qing Bei interrupted Qing Shui’s thoughts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Watching Qing Bei sitting on the Overlord Storm, Qing Shui felt a joy in his heart Now, Qing Bei could be considered an adult already, 21 years old was when a girl was gradually maturing, but she did not have that cold and elegant air or a domineering air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Maybe it is because I see her as a sister!” Qing Shui laughed when he thought of it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Cultivate properly and in the future when you have your own demonic beast, brother will help you refine one.” Qing Shui laughed out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I still do not know when would that be, brother Shui, can I really reach Xiantian Realm?” Qing Bei’s eyes opened wide in hope as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course, in fact, it should be soon. You must make sure to have a stable foundation, after the new years, I will spend some time on you guys. Let’s see whose luck is better, see who is able to reach Xiantian Realm by the end of the year.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“One year’s of time? Amongst us there can be one that can reach Xiantian?” Qing Bei directly jumped off the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and hugged Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yep, don’t you have any confidence?” Qing Shui laughed and ask Qing Bei.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course I do, but those guys can’t make it.” Qing Bei looked at Qing You and the rest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hm! That might not be so, I am just right behind you, there is no saying who would breakthrough first when we both reached Peak Houtian.” Qing You gritted his teeth and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Hui, Qing Shi and a few others did not express their thoughts, but there was a radiance in their eyes. A man would not admit he wasinferior to others, he was very proud.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the reaction of the crowd, this was the effect he wanted!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, do I have any hope? My cultivation level is so low……” Qing Qing asked Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, no one else does, except sister!” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, you are biased, Qing Qing may be your elder sister, but I am your younger sister, do I not have a chance?” Qing Bei pouted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose: “there is, there definitely is, I guarantee it!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Bei was all smiles, after what Qing Bei said, Qing You and the others wanted to say something, Qing Shui just gave a mischievous laughter and said: “A true man needs to have an indomitable spirit, without devoting time and energy, do you think you can do it? Xiantian is merely the start of cultivation, it is the true starting, could it be that you guys intend to make it your final target?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words caused a few people to swallow their words because Qing Shui’s words, in addition to what he had done through the years, had caused them to blush with shame. Especially these two years, using the abilities of a regular person to run with a heavy load, drag stones up a mountain, stand under a huge waterfall, to walk on Blades and Swords, standing in a pool and…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Indeed, with such efforts his current results were not surprising. If there were no results, then who would bother to undergo such suffering?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He took a breath and punched out, there was a fluctuation in the air!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui exhaled, the Back Connecting Fist made Qing Shui feel especially comfortable. Out of so many days, entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal this time felt the best, for this time, there were many things that he could do.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he withdrew his strength and his whole body relaxed, the spiritual energy of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal entered through his pores and he felt comfortable throughout his whole body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Pa! Pa!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly that was a series of popping sounds, his arms and legs trembled, an overwhelming strength arose, and there was shock in Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui almost forgot that the Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs had broken through, Qing Shui did not know how to examine this Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs, Qing Shui only felt that he had cleared five acupoints in each of his arms and legs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On both of his legs, the Liangqiu, Waixiyan, Xiajuxu, Jiexi and Lidui acupoints were cleared. On both his arms, the Tianjing, Zhigou, Waiguan, Yangchi and Zhongzhu acupoints were cleared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feeling that strength, that familiar strength, caused Qing Shui to feel like he was in a dream. After Di Chen exchanged the Acupuncture Point Clearing Arts with him, he never stopped cultivating it, it was just that it had never broken through.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the past two years, Qing Shui did not cultivate it, who knew that when he practiced the Back Connecting Fist, he would suddenly breakthrough, the strength of his arms and legs increased once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although it was not by much, Qing Shui was satisfied, after all, the conditions for clearing acupoints were quite harsh. Furthermore, he could continue to cultivate the Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs, Qing Shui had noticed that Di Chen had opened hundreds of acupoints.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, very soon the cleared acupoints started to warm up, he then circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The last time, he barely succeeded in achieving 199 cycles, Qing Shui felt that this last cycle would not be easy to break through.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Regardless of the difficulty, Qing Shui already made preparations to cultivate it for a long time, after all, the next step is to break through to the 200th cycle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Which meant that he would be breaking into the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was looking forward to it, with each advancement in layer, his strength would be multiplied, Qing Shui felt that as long as he advanced into the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he should be able to achieve the strength of a Martial Saint in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Martial Saint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Right now, Qing Shui thirsted to be a Martial Saint, a Martial Saint could leave the ground and fly. In the World of the Nine Continents, they can be considered to be at the apex, even if they went to the bustling Central Continent or the mysterious spirit energy-rich Eastern Victory Divine Continent, a Martial Saint was someone who could shake up a region.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It does not matter even if he was the lowest grade of Martial Saint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The realm of Martial Saint was similar to the Martial King in that there were ten grades to it, then the peak grade, only then can one touch the Heavenly Daos to look for a chance to break through.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, there is no point in thinking too much now, it was not so easy breaking through to the 6th layer, and Qing Shui felt that he should focus on cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After resting for a while, half the time left in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had passed. After eating something, Qing Shui was in the mood to wander around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The plum blossoms were already collected into a pile, Qing Shui was not in the mood to brew wine, thus he had accumulated a lot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the Energy Enhancing Fruit, Agility Enhancing Fruit…… he had accumulated more than 150 each. Looking at the Agility Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui realized he forgot about one of the effects of the Agility Enhancing Fruit when he got strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It could temporarily raise his speed by 50 percent for 15 minutes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at the big pile of fruits, Qing Shui intended to give some to the others in the Qing Clan. Although, they did not increase abilities by much, but with the few kinds stacked together, the effects were significant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Especially the Agility Enhancing Fruit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An increase of speed by 100 percent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He also collected eight Vermillion Fruit. There were also the seeds he got from the Flowerfruit Mountain, they were planted for three &nbsp;years already, in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, that would be equivalent to 400 years.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But even now, they did not sprout, there were no seeds that sprouted even in 400 years…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was that seed that looked like a flame, Qing Shui really wanted to know what kind of plant it was. The Spiritual energy from it was quite dense.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With regards to the seeds that he did not know how long it would that to sprout, Qing Shui put it aside in his mind. Even if it sprouted, Qing Shui felt that for it to bear fruits, it might take more than 10 years outside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ten years might not feel long nor short, but Qing Shui put it aside in his mind, not harboring much hope for it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing the Pink Peach of Immortality, Qing Shui kept one as he looked into the distance. That was left for Luan Luan, originally Qing Shui intended to leave one for Luan Luan even if he died, so her lifespan would increase by 100 years, then using her Seven Apertures Mystical Heart, it might be possible to heal himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Medicinal herbs in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were almost 900 old years old, after a period of time, they would all turn into 1000 year old herbs. This way, he would have sufficient ingredients for cultivating some medicinal pellet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He picked up the Heaven Shaking Hammer!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a strange feeling in his body as he raised it up. In the past two years, after he gained some strength, the techniques Qing Shui practiced the most was the Thousand Hammer Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was infused into the Heaven Shaking Hammer and he expertly brandished the hammer. There was a flash of golden light, his vital energy, spirit energy, and essences merged into a scary combination.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he brandished the hammer, there was the sound of thunder crackling in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Realm of the Thousand Hammer Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Peak Obscure Realm of the Thousand Hammer Technique had broken through, most obviously was the charm of it, even the Heavenly Realm Taichi Fist and Basic Sword Techniques did not have the domineering air of this hammer.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Bang!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Bang!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every time the hammer struck, Qing Shui felt that he could not stop, he was fully immersed in it. Every strike had a delicate feeling, yet it was domineering beyond compare.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The delicateness of this, which helped him control his strength to a fine level, could be integrated into the realm of Minute Subtlety. This would allow him to use the smallest strength and the minimimal amount of energy to damage the opponent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practised the Thousand Hammer Technique for a whole six hours before stopping, it had an outrageously unrestrained feeling to it, a certain sense of comfort that can’t be explained, just like orgasming together with an extremely beautiful lady when having sex…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Heaven Shaking Hammer, then he looked at the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Its weight seemed to be heavier than the Heaven Shaking Hammer by a little.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What if he used the sword as a hammer?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thinking of this, Qing Shui felt excited and he picked up the Big Dipper Sword! He stared blankly for a moment, then slammed down the sword, a heavy sword without an edge.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Big Dipper Sword was definitely worthy of the name heavy sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The might of that sword was not greater than the earlier hammer, but Qing Shui felt that it was missing something, a feeling perhaps?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immersed himself in using the Big Dipper Sword to execute an entire set of the Thousand Hammer Technique, it appeared to be smooth with a strong vigor, but now, Qing Shui knew what it was lacking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A domineering air!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“I still do not know when would that be, brother Shui, can I really reach Xiantian Realm?” Qing Bei’s eyes opened wide in hope as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course, in fact, it should be soon. You must make sure to have a stable foundation, after the new years, I will spend some time on you guys. Let’s see whose luck is better, see who is able to reach Xiantian Realm by the end of the year.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“One year’s of time? Amongst us there can be one that can reach Xiantian?” Qing Bei directly jumped off the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and hugged Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yep, don’t you have any confidence?” Qing Shui laughed and ask Qing Bei.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course I do, but those guys can’t make it.” Qing Bei looked at Qing You and the rest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hm! That might not be so, I am just right behind you, there is no saying who would breakthrough first when we both reached Peak Houtian.” Qing You gritted his teeth and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Hui, Qing Shi and a few others did not express their thoughts, but there was a radiance in their eyes. A man would not admit he wasinferior to others, he was very proud.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the reaction of the crowd, this was the effect he wanted!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, do I have any hope? My cultivation level is so low……” Qing Qing asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, no one else does, except sister!” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, you are biased, Qing Qing may be your elder sister, but I am your younger sister, do I not have a chance?” Qing Bei pouted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose: “there is, there definitely is, I guarantee it!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Bei was all smiles, after what Qing Bei said, Qing You and the others wanted to say something, Qing Shui just gave a mischievous laughter and said: “A true man needs to have an indomitable spirit, without devoting time and energy, do you think you can do it? Xiantian is merely the start of cultivation, it is the true starting, could it be that you guys intend to make it your final target?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s words caused a few people to swallow their words because Qing Shui’s words, in addition to what he had done through the years, had caused them to blush with shame. Especially these two years, using the abilities of a regular person to run with a heavy load, drag stones up a mountain, stand under a huge waterfall, to walk on Blades and Swords, standing in a pool and…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Indeed, with such efforts his current results were not surprising. If there were no results, then who would bother to undergo such suffering?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He took a breath and punched out, there was a fluctuation in the air!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui exhaled, the Back Connecting Fist made Qing Shui feel especially comfortable. Out of so many days, entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal this time felt the best, for this time, there were many things that he could do.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he withdrew his strength and his whole body relaxed, the spiritual energy of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal entered through his pores and he felt comfortable throughout his whole body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Pa! Pa!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly that was a series of popping sounds, his arms and legs trembled, an overwhelming strength arose, and there was shock in Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui almost forgot that the Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs had broken through, Qing Shui did not know how to examine this Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs, Qing Shui only felt that he had cleared five acupoints in each of his arms and legs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On both of his legs, the Liangqiu, Waixiyan, Xiajuxu, Jiexi and Lidui acupoints were cleared. On both his arms, the Tianjing, Zhigou, Waiguan, Yangchi and Zhongzhu acupoints were cleared.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feeling that strength, that familiar strength, caused Qing Shui to feel like he was in a dream. After Di Chen exchanged the Acupuncture Point Clearing Arts with him, he never stopped cultivating it, it was just that it had never broken through.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the past two years, Qing Shui did not cultivate it, who knew that when he practiced the Back Connecting Fist, he would suddenly breakthrough, the strength of his arms and legs increased once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although it was not by much, Qing Shui was satisfied, after all, the conditions for clearing acupoints were quite harsh. Furthermore, he could continue to cultivate the Acupuncture Clearing of Four Limbs, Qing Shui had noticed that Di Chen had opened hundreds of acupoints.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, very soon the cleared acupoints started to warm up, he then circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The last time, he barely succeeded in achieving 199 cycles, Qing Shui felt that this last cycle would not be easy to break through.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Regardless of the difficulty, Qing Shui already made preparations to cultivate it for a long time, after all, the next step is to break through to the 200th cycle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Which meant that he would be breaking into the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was looking forward to it, with each advancement in layer, his strength would be multiplied, Qing Shui felt that as long as he advanced into the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he should be able to achieve the strength of a Martial Saint in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Martial Saint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Right now, Qing Shui thirsted to be a Martial Saint, a Martial Saint could leave the ground and fly. In the World of the Nine Continents, they can be considered to be at the apex, even if they went to the bustling Central Continent or the mysterious spirit energy-rich Eastern Victory Divine Continent, a Martial Saint was someone who could shake up a region.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It does not matter even if he was the lowest grade of Martial Saint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The realm of Martial Saint was similar to the Martial King in that there were ten grades to it, then the peak grade, only then can one touch the Heavenly Daos to look for a chance to break through.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, there is no point in thinking too much now, it was not so easy breaking through to the 6th layer, and Qing Shui felt that he should focus on cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After resting for a while, half the time left in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had passed. After eating something, Qing Shui was in the mood to wander around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The plum blossoms were already collected into a pile, Qing Shui was not in the mood to brew wine, thus he had accumulated a lot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the Energy Enhancing Fruit, Agility Enhancing Fruit…… he had accumulated more than 150 each. Looking at the Agility Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui realized he forgot about one of the effects of the Agility Enhancing Fruit when he got strong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It could temporarily raise his speed by 50 percent for 15 minutes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at the big pile of fruits, Qing Shui intended to give some to the others in the Qing Clan. Although, they did not increase abilities by much, but with the few kinds stacked together, the effects were significant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Especially the Agility Enhancing Fruit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An increase of speed by 100 percent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He also collected eight Vermillion Fruit. There were also the seeds he got from the Flowerfruit Mountain, they were planted for three &nbsp;years already, in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, that would be equivalent to 400 years.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But even now, they did not sprout, there were no seeds that sprouted even in 400 years…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was that seed that looked like a flame, Qing Shui really wanted to know what kind of plant it was. The Spiritual energy from it was quite dense.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With regards to the seeds that he did not know how long it would that to sprout, Qing Shui put it aside in his mind. Even if it sprouted, Qing Shui felt that for it to bear fruits, it might take more than 10 years outside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ten years might not feel long nor short, but Qing Shui put it aside in his mind, not harboring much hope for it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing the Pink Peach of Immortality, Qing Shui kept one as he looked into the distance. That was left for Luan Luan, originally Qing Shui intended to leave one for Luan Luan even if he died, so her lifespan would increase by 100 years, then using her Seven Apertures Mystical Heart, it might be possible to heal himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Medicinal herbs in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were almost 900 old years old, after a period of time, they would all turn into 1000 year old herbs. This way, he would have sufficient ingredients for cultivating some medicinal pellet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He picked up the Heaven Shaking Hammer!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a strange feeling in his body as he raised it up. In the past two years, after he gained some strength, the techniques Qing Shui practiced the most was the Thousand Hammer Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was infused into the Heaven Shaking Hammer and he expertly brandished the hammer. There was a flash of golden light, his vital energy, spirit energy, and essences merged into a scary combination.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he brandished the hammer, there was the sound of thunder crackling in the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Realm of the Thousand Hammer Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Peak Obscure Realm of the Thousand Hammer Technique had broken through, most obviously was the charm of it, even the Heavenly Realm Taichi Fist and Basic Sword Techniques did not have the domineering air of this hammer.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Bang!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Bang!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every time the hammer struck, Qing Shui felt that he could not stop, he was fully immersed in it. Every strike had a delicate feeling, yet it was domineering beyond compare.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The delicateness of this, which helped him control his strength to a fine level, could be integrated into the realm of Minute Subtlety. This would allow him to use the smallest strength and the minimimal amount of energy to damage the opponent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practised the Thousand Hammer Technique for a whole six hours before stopping, it had an outrageously unrestrained feeling to it, a certain sense of comfort that can’t be explained, just like orgasming together with an extremely beautiful lady when having sex…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the Heaven Shaking Hammer, then he looked at the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Its weight seemed to be heavier than the Heaven Shaking Hammer by a little.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What if he used the sword as a hammer?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thinking of this, Qing Shui felt excited and he picked up the Big Dipper Sword! He stared blankly for a moment, then slammed down the sword, a heavy sword without an edge.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Big Dipper Sword was definitely worthy of the name heavy sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The might of that sword was not greater than the earlier hammer, but Qing Shui felt that it was missing something, a feeling perhaps?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immersed himself in using the Big Dipper Sword to execute an entire set of the Thousand Hammer Technique, it appeared to be smooth with a strong vigor, but now, Qing Shui knew what it was lacking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A domineering air!</p>
