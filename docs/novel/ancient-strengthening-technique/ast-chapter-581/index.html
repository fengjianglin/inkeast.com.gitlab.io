 <p><strong>AST 581 - Demon Binding Ropes? A friend surpassing the level of a soul mate</strong></p>
 <p>Earlier, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant used a Mighty Elephant Stomp to turn these villas into ruins. Now, within the villas there were still some wretched howls coming out, but no one came out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui just stood there and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant returned to his side. Yiye Jiange could only stare blankly at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, even now she still felt that she was dreaming.</p>
 <p>The 30 odd severely injured old men who escaped earlier stood up and walking unsteadily over to Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>“Sire, the Zhan Clan relied on their great strength and forced a hundred clans of the Four Seas Country to merge into the Hundred Clan War Barracks. We had no other choice, they used our families as hostages.”</p>
 <p>“Bring us to the Zhan Clan!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said expressionlessly.</p>
 <p>At a glance, everything within sight had already turned into ruins. However, the villa was big. Although the houses had collapsed, the number of people injured or dead were not many.</p>
 <p>Many people were gathered together. A very small portion of people stood on the other side, their faces were filled with pride. Qing Shui felt that they should be the people from the Zhan Clan, furthermore, they were not aware that their backer had already died.</p>
 <p>When that group of people saw Qing Shui and his group appear, they seemed to have realized something was awry. Their originally prideful faces now seemed to express shock.</p>
 <p>However, the eyes of the rest brightened and stared intently at this strong and handsome youth. A tall and sturdy man suddenly roared out: “Zhan pig, it is time to repay the debt of violating my wife!”</p>
 <p>“And my wife as well!”</p>
 <p>“My younger sister was forced to death by him!”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>The scene that occurred in an instant caused Qing Shui to stupefied. The people of the Zhan Clan were quickly beaten to death by the angry mob…...</p>
 <p>“Sire, as you see, they are innocent. We old men are not afraid to die., If it were not for them, then so what if we were killed by the Zhan Clan.” the earlier old man sighed.</p>
 <p>Everyone from the Zhan Clan perished. However, Qing Shui did not kill any of the others. After he asked about where the territory of the Zhan Clan was, Qing Shui went and stopped at a big rock garden.</p>
 <p>This was originally a big rock garden in the backyard of the Zhan Clan, It was a pity that after the pavilions were destroyed, this rock garden obviously became damaged.</p>
 <p>Although the main gates were sturdy, Qing Shui felt that the strength of 200 countries would be sufficient to force it open. This job naturally fell to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>The huge gate made of an unknown metal had a hole knocked into it; the unusual stone of the rock garden also crumbled.</p>
 <p>More than half of the rock garden collapsed!</p>
 <p>A set of perfectly straight stone steps extended downwards, Setting up a treasury like this was common in the World of the Nine Continents. Just like the designs of the pavilions, where the first thing you see when you enter was the living room. These were the habits that were accumulated over time.</p>
 <p>As the body of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was too big, it could only wait outside. As for the two young girls and Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui got them to stay outside!</p>
 <p>“It is too dangerous to go alone……”</p>
 <p>After Yiye Jiange said that, she lowered her head. Earlier, she had thought that they would not be able to escape. Thus she revealed the feelings in her heart. Now when she thought about it, she felt flustered. Now that they were out of trouble, she suddenly felt embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Weng Weng……”</p>
 <p>“With them leading the way, you can relax. I will not risk my life because of greed, I am very afraid of death.” Qing Shui smiled after saying that, then proceeded to follow the Jade Emperor Bees down.</p>
 <p>He is afraid of death, yet in order to allow the two young girls to live, he could risk his own life without hesitating……</p>
 <p>“How poor!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui found out in dismay that the things here were all second rate. In other words, they were not able to catch Qing Shui’s attention. When he looked through the Demonic Beast Skins, the best was only a low-grade Martial King leveled Demonic Beast skin, however, Qing Shui could still keep them to use for drawing. As for weapons and armors, Qing Shui just took a quick look.</p>
 <p>Medicinal herbs above a thousand years in age were taken away but there weren’t too many of those. However, at least he could use those. As he looked through, he kept the stuff he wanted in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He kept grumbling about despite the Zhan Clan have Martial Saints, they were this poor.</p>
 <p>Even when he was about to arrive at the deepest areas, Qing Shui did not discover any decent items!</p>
 <p>“En!”</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was about to give up, Qing Shui suddenly discovered a faint mysterious Spiritual energy using his Spiritual Sense. His heart beat faster, he had encountered this feeling once before. That was when he sensed the Soulshake bell in Southern City.</p>
 <p>Finally, Qing Shui locked his gaze on a grayish rope. This was the source of the Spiritual energy fluctuations.</p>
 <p>Dust completely covered that rope. Qing Shui used his hands to sweep away most of the dust, exposing its original color.</p>
 <p>Light yellow color!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui took a look, his heart was stirred!</p>
 <p>Demon Binding Ropes!</p>
 <p>It was actually the Demon Binding Ropes. Qing Shui looked at that item that looked exactly the same as the one in his memories. It was giving off a mysterious Spiritual energy, that light yellow colored rope seemed to be robust and powerful.</p>
 <p>“It can’t be that it only looks like it!” Qing Shui stretched his hands out to pick up the rope that looked like the Demon Binding Ropes. Upon contact with it, Qing Shui knew that this rope was made from the tendons of Demonic Beasts…...</p>
 <p>Till now, the Demonic beast tendons that he touched so far were not as strong as this tendon Even the tendon of the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast could not compare to it.</p>
 <p>This strip of tendon had been refined by a blacksmith. Qing Shui thought about the abilities of the Soulshake bell, but he did not know why did the Zhan Clan leave the rope here and not use it. Since they placed it here, they probably did not know the value of it. However, he thought about how the things here were not good. Within the treasury of the Zhan Clan, only this item was pretty good; maybe they could not figure out how to use it…...</p>
 <p>He circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and slowly infused it into the Demon Binding Ropes. Soon, Qing Shui could feel a problem; the insides did not seemed to be connected. He just threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, preparing to go back and use the Ancient Strengthening Technique restore it. If he could restore it, it would be much stronger.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was looking forward to using the Demon Binding Ropes. After being bound by this thing, the target would not be able to move and could only get slaughtered by others. However, he did not know how long would it last for.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Qing Shui made his way out. If that was indeed the Demon Binding Ropes, then this time there was a big harvest. This treasury that was worse than the storehouse of a bandit…...</p>
 <p>“Father, is there anything good?” Luan Luan blinked her big eyes and asked in curiosity.</p>
 <p>“They are really poor, I only took a few beast skins and herbs, the rest of the items are trash.” Qing Shui stretched his hands out to rub Luan Luan’s head.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go home, or else grandfather and the others will keep thinking about us.” Qing Shui summoned the Fire Bird!</p>
 <p>“Father, let me ride on that golden elephant!” Luan Luan asked hopefully as she hugged Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant in midair. Luan Luan pulled Yuchang on to it, then turn her head to look at Qing Shui and blinked her large eyes. “Have a good talk with mother, we won’t disturb you.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched as the two young girls laughed and climbed onto the back of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He shook his head helplessly. Qing Shui did not know if she could remember the moment when they met. Back then, she was only three years old, the age where memories were still hazy. It was not clear how much she could remember now, the young lass was already thirteen years old.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned his head to look at Yiye Jiange, who was looking into the distance. Her powdered neck seemed to be slightly flushed red from the side. Qing Shui did not think too much of it. From the very start, he had pretended to be husband and wife with this woman he used to call master so that Luan Luan would have both a father and mother.</p>
 <p>Only, Qing Shui kept feeling that it was unfair to Yiye Jiange. This was because aside from Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui still had other women, but she was alone.</p>
 <p>“Even so she thinks that it is unfair for me!” Qing Shui really did not know how to repay her.</p>
 <p>“I hope that you would be blissful and happy, only, I do not know how to make that happen.” Qing Shui gently said, looking at Yiye Jiange’s side.</p>
 <p>Although he had stood beside her plenty of times, he never felt close to her. In front of her, Qing Shui always felt like a child that does not grow old.</p>
 <p>She was an otherworldly woman who did not speak much; Qing Shui never knew what she was thinking about or what she wanted. Today was the first time he saw her cry. From that moment Qing Shui knew that she actually had feelings for him, that she could cry and have a soft side. At that moment Qing Shui felt like his heart was being pricked, just like how he felt when he saw his mother being hurt.</p>
 <p>Up until now, Qing Shui knew that he had treated Yiye Jiange as one of his closest family.</p>
 <p>“I am now very blessed and happy!” Yiye Jiange glanced back at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>“I will definitely bring you to the Lion King's Ridge. Aside from this, can you tell me if you have any other wishes or dreams.” Qing Shui did not know how could he give her happiness.</p>
 <p>“I hope for Luan Luan to be healthy and to grow up happily!” Yiye Jiange said after she thought for a while.</p>
 <p>“This is a definite thing, it does not count, say another one.” Qing Shui answered with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I hope for your family to be happy and safe!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, but this does not count either. Ask for something for yourself, like items you desire, anything you want to do, or any dreams?” Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange’s eyes and said</p>
 <p>“I do not know what I would want, nor do I have anything I want to do. As for dreams, that would be what I said earlier. In addition to that, I also hope to see that one day, you don’t have to toil so hard anymore.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt moved in his heart. This woman was his master and his friend, a friend that understood him well. It was a pity that he did not understand her or what she wanted.</p>
 <p>She had no desires nor demands. Although it was not exactly like that, but it was very close. Maybe now, Luan Luan was her only weak spot. Qing Shui always wanted to ask her a question, but he did not dare to.</p>
 <p>“Do you want to say something? Say it, why are you afraid.” Yiye Jiange smiled gently when she saw Qing Shui wanting to say something but then hesitating.</p>
 <p>That gentle smile caused Qing Shui to relaxed. After thinking for a little then he slowly said, “Master, do you plan to be alone like this forever? Luan Luan should have a bright future, but what about master?</p>
 <p>“Why are you calling me master? You really want to see me marry someone?” The gaze that Yiye Jiange used to look at Qing Shui seemed to fluctuate.</p>
