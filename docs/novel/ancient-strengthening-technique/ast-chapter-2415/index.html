 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2415 - Qing Shui's Nurture God Realm, Seven-Colored Thunder Tribulation</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hint of blood flowed out of the side of their necks. When these people got back to their senses, cold sweat had made the clothes on their backs wet. To think that someone could do something like this in the Forsaken Heaven City! They had dodged earlier, but despite so, they were only able to dodge for a distance of several meters. In the end, there weren't any changes at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had held back. If he didn't, the Divine Weapon Flying Sword's sharpness would be able to instantly kill these people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Windwhisk Willow, the Heavenly Vision Technique, the Emperor's Qi, and the Art of Pursuing, Qing Shui's speed had reached an extremely terrifying level. The difference between them was magnified, and these people weren't even able to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Leave. Don't come and disturb me in the future." Qing Shui waved his hand and brought the others back to the manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people got back to their senses after a while and then they left. Wu Tianya no longer felt ashamed now nor did people find him shameful. Was there something even more shameful than having someone cut a slit on their throats?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had a clear understanding of his strength now. In the Forsaken Heaven Region, he was definitely considered one of the highest level existences. He didn't want to say that he was invincible, but it was really very, very hard to find someone who could surpass him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan had left and Qing Shui had been here for very long. Therefore, he was also planning to leave. Right now, there was nothing left in the Forsaken Heaven Region for him. The Demon Gate and Divine Palace were at a balance again, and there was nothing else to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't wish to think about how he should wipe out the Demon Gate. This was one of the Heavenly Laws, just like how it was with the relationship between the grass, sheeps, and wolves. If the humans were to protect the sheep and kill the wolves, the number of sheep would increase tremendously and then there wouldn't be enough grass for the sheep to eat. The sheep would still end up dying from starvation in the end. Therefore, having the wolves eating up some of the sheep was able to allow for there to be a good balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The relationship between the Demon Gate and Divine Palace was similar. The Demon Gate's existence must be able to restrain the Divine Palace to a certain degree, but the Divine Palace's existence was also for restraining the Demon Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the balance maintained, Qing Shui planned to head to the Upper Three Regions to take a look. This was where the greatest existences in the Nine Continents were and was the most prosperous and powerful place. There were many sects there, and it was a world where powerful experts could be found everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half a year later!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui stayed in the Forsaken Heaven Region for another half a year. This half a year passed by very quietly. Qing Shui spent this time stabilizing his strength and at the same time, the people around him also got stronger at a rapid rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this day, Qing Shui was cultivating in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The ten caves behind him appeared. Right now, nine of them were connected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the result of Qing Shui's training for the past half year. Of course, the half year was referring to the time flow in the outside world. If it was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it would be the equivalent of several decades. He had spent over forty years to connect nine caves together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the connection of each cave, Qing Shui felt as if he had gotten stronger by ten percent. In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui's strength had become extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also the reason why Qing Shui stayed in the Forsaken Heaven City. He wanted to leave after he had connected all ten caves together, and it would be even better if he could attain a breakthrough to the Nurture God Realm before heading to the Upper Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden shimmering caves kept on glowing, but it was very hard to connect the very last cave. It continued to dart about amongst the nine caves and then headed toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's still no good!" Qing Shui came to a stop. The nine caves were connected, but he was unable to connect the tenth cave no matter how hard he tried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui used his Inner Sight and saw that his Dantian's cave had also gotten increasingly strong. He was suddenly stunned for a moment, and his eyes lit up "Maybe I can use this cave to strive for the Nurture God Realm."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the thought of this, Qing Shui was eager to give it a try. With the nine caves connected, he attempted to let the cave in his body connect as the tenth cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, Qing Shui had felt that he had gotten into a blind alley. Actually, getting into a blind alley was a sign of persistence. People without any persistence would find it very hard to succeed no matter what they did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmm, there's some difficulty."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there was some difficulty, the progress was still ongoing and could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven days later, Qing Shui's caves opened up a passageway for the tenth cave’s connection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't rest and continued to let his Dantian's cave connect to the nine caves. This time around, the progress was still very slow, but it seemed to be a little faster compared to before. This time around, he also used about seven days to connect the cave in his Dantian with the nine caves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the connection was formed, Qing Shui felt that his entire body was different. It was as if the entire world had brightened up a lot. It was a mysterious feeling, similar to the Minute Subtlety feeling he had before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then continued to connect the nine caves to the tenth cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, the feeling was different. He felt that he could succeed. Moreover, the cave in his Dantian kept on unleashing a powerful force. The space between the tenth cave and the nine connecting caves slowly reduced. The connection between them was like a golden light passageway. This time around, the caves moved toward the center concurrently, unlike how it was previously where the nine caves had moved toward the tenth cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Closer! They had gotten even closer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt very agitated. He had no idea what would happen later, but he knew he would at least get a little stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A light ringing sound was emitted in Qing Shui's body the moment the connection was complete. It was as if he had been fixed to the spot, and his entire body shone in a glimmery gold. The ten golden caves behind him burst out in golden light as well, and violet aura hovered around Qing Shui's Dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful strength flowed in his body, and his meridian channels expanded and became more tenacious as well. His bones had actually been a golden color, but now their color was a deeper shade. They still appeared to be golden in color, but just seemed to be stronger and sturdier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nurture God Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had entered the Nurture God Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had risen up to the Nurture God Realm after having reached the Great Perfection Stage in his Cave Realm. Qing Shui could be said to have attained the breakthrough after building the strongest base at the Cave Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal wasn't very big, it was unaffected by the Forsaken Heaven Region's Heavenly Laws. Therefore, Qing Shui's strength wasn't restricted while he was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could sense his current strength, a large area of clouds gathered in the sky. They were seven-colored clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunder Tribulation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui hadn't expected the Thunder Tribulation to come. He had only experienced the Thunder Tribulation once and didn't expect it to come again this time around. However, not only wasn't Qing Shui scared, but he even felt a little agitated and a little excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clouds in the sky gathered into a thick cloud layer, glimmering in a myriad of colors and its aura encompassed the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bolt of lightning appeared and a thin thunderbolt that was as fine as yarn landed on Qing Shui's body. Qing Shui absorbed it directly. This thunderbolt made him feel extremely good, just like a dried up desert meeting rainwater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long later, two more thunderbolts landed. The thickness was still about the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, seven bolts came down. Although the numbers didn't continue to increase, the thunderbolts now were as thick as a person's thumb.</span></p>
