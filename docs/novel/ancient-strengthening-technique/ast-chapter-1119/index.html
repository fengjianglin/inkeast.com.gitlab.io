 <p><strong>AST 1119 Old Debts Canceled Out, The Dispute Ends, Yiye Clan's Cemetery</strong></p>
 <p>After Yin Shang gave his order, quite a number of people from Lion King's Ridge dashed toward Qing Shui. The people from Violet Dragon Mountain, Du Yannian and the others surrounded Qing Shui to protect them. "Mister Qing, leave quickly. Come again when you've recovered from your wounds. It'll be easy for you to kill these people then!"</p>
 <p>Du Yannian and Zilong Shi shouted out towards Qing Shui and the others.</p>
 <p>"Kill them! Definitely kill Qing Shui first! Otherwise, we'll all die. The person who kills Qing Shui will be rewarded with a bottle of low grade Sacred Beast Pills and will get to pick any woman for himself." Yin Shang shouted out loudly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's eyes which had been closed all this while suddenly popped open like a sharp blade. Although his injuries were very serious, it didn't mean that he couldn't fight. The reason he hadn't been moving was because he wanted to assess if Du Yannian and the others were worthy of taking over Lion King's Ridge.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he wanted to eliminate the restless influences in the Lion King's Ridge to ensure his family's safety. This would also allow him to feel more at ease when he headed for the other Four Continents.</p>
 <p>And right now, both sides were already engaged. Qing Shui said to Yiye Jiange who was next to him, "Prepare to let the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast attack. Just attack the person who spoke."</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange nodded and immediately let the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast dash towards her. Before it arrived, Qing Shui let the Thunderous Beast strike him with a Thunderbolt first and then a Violet Lightning Strike.</p>
 <p>The Seven-Headed Crystal Beast's huge ice flames incinerated Yin Shang's head. The Seven-Headed Crystal Beast was considered a terrifying creature in the Five Continents and when it teamed up with the Thunderous Beast killing its enemies instantly was easy.</p>
 <p>"People from Lion King's Ridge listen up. Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan won't be able to get themselves anywhere. If you guys stop now, we won't pursue this." At this moment, Du Yannian let out a loud bellow.</p>
 <p>"Kill them!" Yinyue Tong shouted, killing the people on his side who stopped moving. He was making an example out of them to warn the others.</p>
 <p>However, not only did his action lack any effect, the situation exploded. The person he killed was the only son of a capable subordinate in Yinyue Clan. Earlier, he had only wanted to make an example out of someone and didn't check to see who it was.</p>
 <p>"Ah! Yinyue old man! Our Shen Clan has been serving your Yinyue Clan for three generations but to think that you would kill my only son! Brothers! A clan like this isn't worth us joining! Who knows? One day we might just get killed without knowing it!"</p>
 <p>This voice was like a fuse to firecrackers, causing a huge uprise. The Yinyue Clan and Yin Clan were soon left in ruins.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed his eyes and leaned against Yiye Jiange, enjoying the warmth from this special moment. His injuries were recovering gradually and it would be easy for him and the ladies to escape. However, there was no need for him to do so now. Although these influences were powerful in the Five Continents, he really didn't care about them.</p>
 <p>The scene quietened down. To think that the commotion created by Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan would be for naught so quickly. It was to the extent that it seemed like a joke. The two clans had only thought of gaining control over Lion King's Ridge when they saw that Qing Shui was seriously injured.</p>
 <p>The best way to gain control over Lion King's Ridge was to destroy this young man. However, they had ignored this young man's abilities. Even if he didn't do anything, he could still wipe them out and they became a group of people who had lost their pillar of support.</p>
 <p>Although they had enjoyed great glory in Lion King's Ridge, they weren't the people who really supported Lion King's Ridge. It was those people who had been killed earlier, especially those ten or so old men who had come back from the other Four Continents, as well as the powerful Beitang Yiyao.</p>
 <p>Without these people, even if they controlled Lion King's Ridge, their statuses would also plunge greatly. Despite still being a great influence, they were like a tiger whose teeth had been plucked out. While the tiger might still have its impressive aura, it might not necessarily be able to kill a wolf.</p>
 <p>Du Yannian was also a member of the Supreme Elder Association with quite a high status. Back then, the reason Qing Shui had given him a choice like that was because he seemed to be an upright person who wouldn't bend easily. Moreover, his level of cultivation was quite high too.</p>
 <p>"Sir, Lion King's Ridge shall be left to you. You must be insistent on clearing out the people who shouldn't be kept alive and replacing them with your own people. Du Clan has both the capability and the connections." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Du Yannian let out a sigh and said, "Mister, I know what to do. Don't worry, if you encounter any problems in the future, you can take my life whenever you like."</p>
 <p>"The reason we came earlier was to wipe out Beitang Clan. I'll leave the things regarding Lion King's Ridge for your development but I'll need some stuff from Beitang Clan." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Lion King's Ridge was actually not as rich as Beitang Clan. Humans were selfish creatures and over all these years, Beitang Clan had often kept things from Lion King's Ridge for themselves. Moreover, Qing Clan wouldn't move the entire residence with him. He only wanted to gather some things which would be useful for him.</p>
 <p>"Old Du, when you're free, you can go around more with Old Zi. If the two of you were to join forces, there will only be advantages. Since there's no more Beitang Clan, then just forget about the past!" said Qing Shui as he looked at Du Yannian and Zilong Shi.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the others headed for Lion King's Ridge, planning to stay for a few days in the Beitang Residence. This place was just a huge but empty manor now.</p>
 <p>Beitang Clan's manor faced the south and it took up an area of over 1,000 Mu. The two huge lions at the entrance were carved from ‘yellow stone’ and were several tens of meters tall. They exuded a strong and majestic aura, displaying the great dignity of the manor.</p>
 <p>All the pavilions and the buildings in the manor were built exquisitely. Even though the weather was chilly in winter, there was still a hot spring. The buildings were all in dark brown color and were not very tall. However, they looked very sturdy.</p>
 <p>The few ladies helped Qing Shui to one of the rooms. He didn't ask what happened to the family members of Beitang Clan. He didn't wish to know and wasn't willing to know either.</p>
 <p>This was the cruelty of this world. Those who weren't able to become accustomed to the environment would be eliminated. In this world where it was the survival of the fittest, people competed to see who the stronger one was. If Qing Shui didn't have some abilities, he would have died many times over.</p>
 <p>After taking a bath and changing into a fresh set of clothes, Qing Shui wore a thin garment and went into the hot spring. It felt very good to soak in a hot spring in winter. There was a faint layer of warm currents around the hot spring and one would feel especially warm upon entering this area.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui was together with Yiye Jiange and they were both wearing clothes even while in the hot spring. The water in the hot spring wasn't stationary and the others were also going around the place and might just pop in. Therefore, even Qing Shui was wearing his clothes, let alone Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange hadn't wanted to enter the hot spring at first but Qing Shui's words left her with no choice.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange had promised that as long as he stayed alive, she would promise him anything...</p>
 <p>Thinking of this now, she pinched Qing Shui angrily while he took the opportunity to hug her. Their thin clothes were wet and Yiye Jiange's beautiful lines were revealed. He could smell her faint fragrance but he didn't go overboard with his actions. However, she could already feel his body's reaction.</p>
 <p>Now that the matter with Lion King's Ridge was over, Yiye Jiange had completely let go of her emotional burdens. However, thinking of the members of Yiye Clan who had died, Yiye Jiange's mood took a dive.</p>
 <p>Since Qing Shui was hugging her, he could naturally sense her emotions. "What's wrong? Why are you feeling so down?"</p>
 <p>"I want to go and take a look at Yiye Clan." Yiye Jiange said softly.</p>
 <p>"What's so hard about that. Come, we'll go immediately." Qing Shui smiled and carried her out from the hot spring.</p>
 <p>"Your wounds..."</p>
 <p>"They aren't of any concern a long time ago." With that, he circulated Qi to dry both of their clothes.</p>
 <p>"Shall we call your elder brother and that lass along?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"They should already have headed there." Yiye Jiange smiled and called out her Seven-Headed Crystal Beast, and then reached out with her hand towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and took her hand. He then brought her up the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast before they flew toward Yiye Clan.</p>
 <p>Yiye Clan was located in the Northern Sacred Country which wasn't that far away. Since they had nothing else to do, it was good for them to enjoy the flight too. Yiye Jiange was very calm and wore a faint, blissful smile.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you said that I promised you one condition and I have already fulfilled your condition earlier." Yiye Jiange sat in front of Qing Shui, leaning against him as she smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"You were the one who said that you'll promise me anything." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Embracing this beauty in his arms, Qing Shui seemed to have put down a heavy load in his heart as well. Twenty years, it took about twenty years of time. The goal that he had set for himself back then had now finally been achieved. This lady had held a heavy, heavy weight in his heart.</p>
 <p>"I'm a woman. Can't you give in to me?" Yiye Jiange squinted and said softly.</p>
 <p>This was the first time that Qing Shui had seen this great beauty say something so meek, causing him to be stunned. However, he smiled and said, "You're not a woman yet. Are you thinking of becoming one already?"</p>
 <p>"You're a rascal. I don't care, you're a guy. You must make good on your words." Yiye Jiange sat up and said, her face blushing.</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright, I'll promise you. I don't believe that you'll be able to hold it in."</p>
 <p>"You're still saying it..."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange arrived at the place where Yiye Clan had stayed in before, the others had already arrived. It wasn't that the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast wasn't fast enough but more that they hadn't let it travel too fast.</p>
 <p>What astonished the rest of them was that the place was just like how it used to be. The area was almost deserted and the door that was tightly shut. It seemed as if it hadn't been opened for many years. Many of the constructions seemed to have been burned into a black color.</p>
 <p>The signboard on the entrance was long gone and even the entrance was rusty. The place before the door was like a garbage collection area. Yiye Tian slowly pushed opened the door.</p>
 <p>The sound was horrible. Dust and rust fell down.</p>
 <p>Upon opening the door, they could see that the interior was filled with weeds and there were even many trees growing. However, there were also many graves in this area. Back then, Beitang Clan had to maintain their appearances and this was also the reason why the Yiye Residence could be kept as it was.</p>
 <p>Back then, Beitang Clan had, in the name of the Yiye Clan's in-laws, buried these people who they had killed themselves.</p>
 <p>Looking at this scene, Yiye Tian, Yiye Jiange, and Luan Luan cried. They then started to look around these graves.</p>
 <p>Yiye Tian and Yiye Jiange found the graves of their parents. They came across many familiar names as they went through the graves. They thought of the scene when they had escaped back then. This manor that was in ruins was all that was left from the fire back then.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange and Yiye Tian cried as they dropped down on their knees and hands before the grave that was covered in dust. Buckets of tears flowed down their cheeks.</p>
 <p>"Father, mother, rest in peace. Our enemies have already been killed..."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Du Yannian sent someone to clean up the place and reconstruct it into the Yiye Clan's graveyard. They would send people to regularly clean up the area and offer incenses.</p>
 <p>For the next few days, Yiye Jiange and the others would come and offer incense daily. They would talk to the deceased, burn some offerings and perform similar rituals.</p>
 <p>This was a custom. After all, it didn't take very long for Qing Shui to send them to and fro with the Nine Continents Steps.</p>
