 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2288 - Chi Feng and Chi Ao’s biological father?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine Continents Mountain broke the old man’s seal, relentlessly charging towards him. Qing Shui could feel the Old Man’s strength; it was roughly comparable to the Nine Continents Mountain. Seeing how frivolously Nie Wu treated the Bu Clan, him and Nalan Qing were obviously far stronger than Bu Feihua’s third uncle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine Continents Mountain crashed into the body of the old man. The resultant force caused the old man to fly backward, coughing up blood. Despite this, the Nine Continents Mountain continued its assault on him, consecutively crashing down on the Old Man’s body thrice more, knocking him unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This caused all the surrounding spectators to stare in amazement. The third elder was a high-ranked expert in the Bu Clan. Even though he wasn’t the strongest, even Bu Feihua had to treat him with respect and yet, he was knocked out by the treasure in naught but a few blows, leaving him without the strength to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui kept the Nine Continents Mountain and looked at Bu Feihua. “Crushing you is like crushing an ant. Your family may be strong compared to the others in Hua city, but honestly speaking, I have not seen enough to know if your clan has a Guardian Beast, you might want to bring one out to try me,” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cold sweat trickled down Bu Feihua’s face. Just now, he was fearlessly ogling this man’s women. If Qing Shui got angry, the Bu Clan would be unable to protect him. Even his third uncle was downed in a single move, and Bu Feihua didn’t know how much of it was his own strength and how much of it was the treasure. If only he had such a treasure…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bu Feihua thought about it but lacked the guts to try and rob him. He didn’t even know if he would be let off now. He gritted his teeth and asked Qing Shui, “Today’s matter was our fault, how would you like to handle this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must pay the price for your wrongdoings. Now screw off!” Qing Shui sent them all tumbling away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bu Feihua didn’t even dare to whimper as he took his men and quickly ran off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was too lenient to let them off that easily, especially that Bu Feihua,” Hao Tian said with regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you not see how awkwardly he walked as he left. From this day forth, he will never be able to be a real man. Isn’t having to live with that a harsher punishment than killing him on the spot?” Qing Shui chuckled slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hao Tian tightened his muscles and said immediately, “I harbor nothing towards your ladies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was taken aback by how serious Hao Tian was taking this matter and laughed as he replied, “No worries, my ladies aren’t so easily stolen by others, especially not you. You are too boring and violent, whereas my ladies are so clever and gentle; they won’t fall in love with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m boring and violent? I feel like you’re ten times worse than me,” Hao Tian said in a shocked and depressed voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All right, we should go, we must find a place soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they were about to leave, Qing Shui looked up at the sky. A man riding a golden eagle caught their attention as he had a Fiendish body, and his face gave him a sense of familiarity. It seemed that there were serious hidden injuries within him. Despite this, he was still slightly stronger than even Nie Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was curious as to who this man was. He didn’t know that Hua city had people who were this strong. A man this strong would definitely be the peak in the entire Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that the man looked around middle-aged despite his youth had something to do with his injuries. He indeed looked much more mature than people of his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was stunned. When he used the Heavenly Vision Technique to determine the disease that the man had, he unintentionally spotted a pendant on his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This excited Qing Shui as both Chi Ao and Chi Feng had the same pendant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui had been at the Jade Mountain Village in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, he had met the grandson and granddaughter of the old village elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had helped to suppress the pernicious aura of the two kids. Back then, Qing Shui could only feel their strong constitution, so he roughly gauged that they had an extraordinary background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this constitution could be harmful to their families and so their parents decided to abandon them. This was what he had thought then. Later on, when Qing Shui got stronger, he overthrew this idea because this kind of lineage would have a way of suppressing the pernicious aura, such as a special technique or treasure. The only hint to their background, however, was just the pendants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this man’s heavy injuries, seemingly compounded by many years of ailment, it must’ve been truly a scene if this man had been separated from the pair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man stared at Qing Shui with a shocked face. He also didn’t understand; he was sure that he did not know this young lad or the people next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How should I address mister?” Qing Shui smiled as he walked up towards the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man laughed as he said, “I am Chi Yang, how do I address you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Shui, your surname is Chi?” Qing Shui thought again. Chi Ao and Chi Feng’s names were all from the pendant and not from the old village elder of the Jade Mountain Village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed, is there something wrong with that?” Chi Yang said unknowingly upon seeing Qing Shui’s shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It just that your face looks very familiar although I am very certain that I have never seen you before,” Qing Shui could not mention the pendant. After all, the pendant was underneath the man’s clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“True, this world is home to many people and many of which look similar. I don’t think there is anything extraordinary about it,” Chi Yang didn’t think too much of it, putting it off simply as Qing Shui’s attempt to strike a conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You misunderstand, the people I know is a pair of siblings who look all too similar to you and share the same surname with you. It’s a shame you live so far apart. Curious… very curious,” Qing Shui said without giving it much thought, shaking his head as he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What was their names and where did you meet them?” Chi Yang’s facial expression finally changed, his whole body getting immeasurably excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Their names were written on the pendants they were wearing. The boy was called Chi Ao, and the girl was called Chi Feng. They’ve been at my home for twenty or so years. Why do you ask, my brother?” Qing Shui saw that Chi Yang was shivering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man took down the pendant from his neck and looked at Qing Shui with a gaze full of hope. “Is this the type of pendant you were talking about, brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui knew that there was a high chance that Chi Ao and Chi Feng were the children of this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How similar, the three of you look so similar and all share the surname Chi…” As Qing Shui didn’t know much and wasn’t completely sure, he was very excited and a bit hopeful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are my children and thirty-eight years ago, we were under attack. At that time, my wife and I successfully got away. But the enemy was vicious and we got badly injured in the process. We escaped out of the Eight Desolates Region, out of the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain, yet they refused to relent. I had to give the two children to two of our clan’s protectors, as me and my wife were the main targets. Few of us survived and I never dared to seek the children out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man, upon saying his piece, took a moment to catch his breath. By the looks of it, he was quite emotionally unstable and then said aggressively, “How are they now?”</span></p>
