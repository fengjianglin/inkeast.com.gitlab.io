 <p><strong>AST 821 - Departing on the Eve</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged her gently. When he had came over, he had decided to gamble even though the odds of finding her were close to zero. However, he had actually managed to chase up to her.</p>
 <p>Di Qing hugged Qing Shui very tightly. Her alluring body was trembling faintly, and the fluctuations in her heart were very intense as she softly made sobbing noises.</p>
 <p>“Don’t cry, sister Qing.” said Qing Shui as he gently patted her back.</p>
 <p>This was the second or third time he had hugged her. The Nine Continents were generally laid back about things, but a large portion of women were very traditional, even down to the bone.</p>
 <p>When Di Qing raised her head again with her tear-filled, slightly red-pupiled beautiful appearance, she looked at Qing Shui earnestly with a face without makeup that made her seem exceptionally pitiful. From the look in her eyes, she seemed to want to place Qing Shui into her heart, to the place where her soul was.</p>
 <p>“Why did you chase after me? Qing Shui, I’d already decided not to see you again, but why did you just have to appear?” asked Di Qing softly as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I’m slightly slow when it comes to relationships…”</p>
 <p>“You’re not slow. You’re a hard and stiff tree root.” replied Di Qing as she continued to hug Qing Shui, not letting him go.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless for a while. Bitterly laughing, he looked towards the magnificent girl who was hugging him, “Elder sister Qing, you should know that I’ve more than one girl with me. If you follow me, I’m afraid it’d wrong you.”</p>
 <p>“Do I look like I feel wronged? This is the first time I’ve liked someone, and also the first time I’ve confessed to someone. However I’ve been hurt and covered in wounds.”replied Di Qing dejectedly as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt touched. Such a girl had given up everything to be by his side. His heart was not stone. This was coupled with the fact that the two of them had been in contact with each other for quite a while. Really though, the most important reason Di Qing felt this way was due to Di Chen.</p>
 <p>It was not that Di Chen had forbidden their relationship. Instead, she seemingly had thought of playing matchmaker for the two of them, and had even mentioned it to him. However, he had felt that this was slightly unfair for Di Chen.</p>
 <p>If Di Chen and Di Qing weren’t sisters, there would probably have been a different ending for Di Qing now.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you don’t like me a single bit?” Di Qing seemed to have gathered the courage to ask this question. In addition, Qing Shui could feel that her heart was currently racing.</p>
 <p>“There’s no one who doesn't like beauties. However liking and loving are two separate matters. In fact, it took quite a lot of courage to reject you.” Qing Shui replied earnestly with a bitter face.</p>
 <p>“Is that true?” Hearing Qing Shui’s reply, Di Qing felt happy, her hand hugging Qing Shui more tightly.</p>
 <p>“That’s naturally true. Although you’re not gentle enough, you’re a super great beauty.” replied Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Who say’s that I’m not gentle? I’m very gentle…” Di Qing’s face turned slightly red as she looked at Qing Shui. She did not know whether his previous sentence was praising her or something else.</p>
 <p>“You’re very gentle right now. Okay, okay, you’re still crying your nose off at such a big age. Come on, stop rubbing your mucus on me…” said Qing Shui gently as he rubbed the tear stains off her face. When his hand made contact with that tender and lovely skin, it made both their hearts jump and skip.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had helped Di Qing stop crying before, that situation didn’t have the ambiguous flavor of this moment. This was all due to the two of them seemingly untying the knots in their hearts.</p>
 <p>“You’re the snot-nosed one...it’s all because of you. I want you to compensate me.” said Di Qing bashfully as she wrapped her hands around his neck in a annoyed tone.</p>
 <p>“Okay. I’ll compensate you. Tell me, what do you want as compensation?” asked Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I want you to say you love me.” said Di Qing in a soft voice as she faintly lowered her head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gawked before looking at the girl whose face was turning even redder. Her lovely earlobes had turned an alluring pink, giving off an aura that made people’s blood boil.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui extend his hand and held her chin, putting her beautiful face that could lead to the downfall of countries right in front of his. The amorous feelings he had in that instant almost enraptured him.</p>
 <p>“Are you certain that you’ll have no regrets?”</p>
 <p>“I won’t regret it. Even if I had to jump through fire, I won’t have any regrets.” replied Di Qing in an extremely soft voice. However her firm tone was unconcealable.</p>
 <p>“Qing’er, I love you.” said Qing Shui softly as he hugged her.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I love you too.” said Di Qing gently into Qing Shui’s ear.</p>
 <p>This instantly made Qing Shui’s heart jump. It seemed as though his heart was touched, and unknowingly, he had already hugged her tightly. They could feel the other’s heart racing.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go back. If you left, how would we be able to deepen our relationship?”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I really want to go back. Don’t worry about me. I really miss home. If we are in love, this short separation won’t mean anything. I’ll find you.” After thinking, Di Qing raised her head slightly and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened his mouth and wanted to say something, however he was prevented by a kiss from Di Qing, blocking his mouth...</p>
 <p>Gawking, he looked at her, faintly closing her eyes as her delicate body faintly shivered. Her kiss awkwardly rubbed against his mouth, but this just made Qing Shui more stimulated.</p>
 <p>Gradually, under the guidance of Qing Shui, the two of them had come to a tacit understanding. The beautiful and wonderful feeling of those lips akin to flower petals made Qing Shui forget about time.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui’s hands rubbed on her large mounds, Di Qing pressed down on his hands as her face burned up, “That’s enough, you’re not allowed to act badly.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Di Qing’s exceptionally beautiful face as his hands continued to blaspheme her. Looking at her lovely and ashamed look, it was as if his soul suffered an attack.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Not quite yet.” He continued for at least a minute before Di Qing voiced her annoyance with a beet red face.</p>
 <p>Reluctant to part, Qing Shui withdrew his hands before saying a sentence in Di Qing’s ear, causing her to be even more ashamed and unable to show her face. At this point, her face turned an even more scarlet red, akin to fire.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Are you truly going to leave?” At this time, Qing Shui and Di Qing had already landed in the wilderness.</p>
 <p>“Yes, you can come find me, or I’ll come find you in the future. In any case you better not get rid of me for your entire life.” said Di Qing happily.</p>
 <p>“Take this and eat it. It’ll help you.” Qing Shui took out the Fate Pill he had prepared for Huoyun Liu-li and handed it to Di Qing</p>
 <p>Looking at Qing Shui, Di Qing did not say anything else and directly swallowed it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui guarded her as she broke through. She was undoubtedly one of those matchless girls from the of the Portraits of Beauties, breaking through straight from Grade Two Martial Saint to Grade Four Martial Saint, increasing over 400 counties of strength. Di Qing was incomparably happy. She was an independent girl, and her breakthrough in strength was a happy thing for her. It was as if she had received two times the happiness today.</p>
 <p>For a day, the pair spent basically all of their time on the back of the Fire Bird. Since she was going to leave, Qing Shui bluntly used this method to give her a day of his time.</p>
 <p>Just like that, the two of them snuggled together on the back of the Fire Bird, talking about their worries. From time to time, Di Qing’s seductive voice would ring out, and this continued all the way to the next day.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, go back. It’s already very far.” said Di Qing as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head and replied, “ Close your eyes. I’ll send you off for the rest of the journey.</p>
 <p>Di Qing slowly closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept the Firebird and hugged the already blushing Di Qing. She had assumed that he wanted to kiss her.</p>
 <p>Laughing, Qing Shui kissed her lips as he simultaneously used the Nine Continent Steps.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Di Qing did not know what had even happened.</p>
 <p>Their kiss lasted at least a minute. Still unwilling, their lips separated. Di Qing mounted her Azure-eyed Silver Falcon and left, with Qing Shui waiting for her figure to disappear over the horizon before mounting the Firebird and returning.</p>
 <p>It was already the third day when he returned home. Within these three days, Qing Shui had refined the Mysterious Fruit he had kept into Fate Pills. Perhaps due to the increase in his alchemy skills, he had unexpectedly refined four pills.</p>
 <p>This could be considered a big breakthrough, as the price of every Fate Pill was astronomical and the pill was not a trace inferior to the Xiantian Golden Pellet.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui returned to the Qing Family, all the clan members felt quite relieved. Upon knowing that Di Qing had returned home safely, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Qing Shui proceeded to hand a Fate Pill to Yiye Jiange, Huoyun Liu-li, Canghai Mingyue and Wenren Wushuang.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, can this really help me breakthrough to Martial Saint Stage?” asked Huoyun Liu-li as she looked towards Qing Shui with a frown.</p>
 <p>“Are you not happy?” asked Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“No, but isn’t it harder for Martial Saints to have children?” asked Huoyun Liu-li as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“It’s originally like that, but nothing is absolute.” Qing Shui had never imagined that she would be perturbed over this.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I feel like waiting for a child before I consume it. Would that be alright? Recently I’ve not even dared to train, as I’m afraid of breaking through to Martial Saint.” said Huoyun Liu-li gently.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this lass was too cute. There might be people within the World of the Nine Continents that may have the same thoughts, but those with the same absolute resoluteness would be as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
 <p>“You can definitely do that.” replied Qing Shui with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“Okay!” she replied in a very low voice.</p>
 <p>“Seductress, let us go plow the seed and give birth to a child earlier.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After consuming the Fate Pill, Yiye Jiange became a Grade Five Martial Saint, Canghai Mingyue became a Grade Four Martial Saint and Wenren Wu-shang became a Grade Three Martial Saint</p>
 <p>The Fate Pill wasn’t the most precious treasure in the world, but it was absolutely a powerful pill. Everyone could only consume one in their lifetime.</p>
 <p>The strength of the others in the Qing Clan had also rapidly increased. Qing Shui had long given them all the pills and medicines that they required. That included the All Aspect Nourishment Soup and the Tiger Bone Soup, and he had even given the recipe and some spices to the members of Qing Family.</p>
 <p>Not much time was left, and Qing Shui felt that he should head back to Flowerfruit Mountain. His Nature Energy had reached the Sixth Grade, so it should be possible for him to save the lady in the crystal coffin.</p>
 <p>He planned to save that lady and consider their dealings even. After all, he had taken a drawing from her and a pearl from that gate keeping old turtle. If not for that pearl, he would not have been able to subdue that Spirit Snake Turtle and gain those benefits.</p>
 <p>“Maybe I’m the only one who can help you.” Qing Shui thought about that lady who had been asleep for some unknown amount of time.</p>
 <p>A lady akin to a goddess.</p>
 <p>The Misty Hall was now under the leadership of Yiye Jiange, with a few girls helping her. The Misty Hall had become the strongest hall of the nine halls in the Heavenly Palace. Their existence might lead to the Heavenly Palace becoming extraordinarily splendid in the future.</p>
 <p>He was about to leave and he did not know how long it would be before he could settle down again. Hopefully, it should be quick.</p>
