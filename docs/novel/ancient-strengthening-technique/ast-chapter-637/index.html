 <p><strong>AST 637 - Battle, Supplementary Techniques are just as excellent!</strong></p>
 <p>“He’s here! Let’s go and confront him now!” Di Xuan stood as he made the suggestion.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Old Madam Mo stood as well. They were both aware that Di Xuan’s true intention was to avoid turning this place into the battlefield.</p>
 <p>Actually, everyone was nervous. But other than feeling nervous, they also felt a tinge of excitement. After all, Old Demon Ba was a supreme expert. Furthermore, he also had the Red Jiao with him.</p>
 <p>“Chen`er, stay here and wait for me.” Qing Shui told Di Chen with a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>“Ok, you have to be careful.” Di Chen said anxiously, as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m not willing to leave my peerless beauty alone in this world.” As Qing Shui saw Di Chen’s eyes filled with worry, he couldn’t resist comforting her.</p>
 <p>“How are you still so talkative at a time like this.” Di Chen reached out to straighten Qing Shui’s slightly wrinkled collar.</p>
 <p>Staring at the beauty in front of him, her every action and expression caused Qing Shui’s mood to improve. He had imagined many situations and pictured many heartwarming scenes. However, only when things actually happened did he realise how he truly felt inside.</p>
 <p>He spontaneously embraced Di Chen, at this moment, the other people that were nearby to Qing Shui seemed to turn blurry to him, as though he could only see her. At this moment, Qing Shui felt that Di Chen was a true woman, one that only belonged to him.</p>
 <p>Looking closely at that beautiful face, he could clearly see her fine black eyelashes. Qing Shui’s heart rate suddenly skyrocketed; being in such close proximity was an indescribable yet beautiful feeling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently kissed Di Chen on the cheek, before turning around to leave.</p>
 <p>Di Chen beamed as she looked at Qing Shui’s figure fade into the distance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, Di Xuan and Old Madam Mo travelled for approximately ten li.</p>
 <p>Skywalking at the height of a thousand metres, they glimpsed upon a tiny black dot in the distance. That was none other than Old Demon Ba, who was rushing over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui calmly took out Godly Force Talismans and Divine Shield Talismans, directly patting them on everyone present. In an instant, everyone felt a great surge in energy, with both their body’s strength and defence increasing by a considerable 40%.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Old Lady Mo gained a whole new level of respect for Qing Shui. Just the day before, she witnessed Qing Shui’s bizarre ability to weaken an opponent. Today, she experienced the effects of his ability enhancing talismans. Although it paled in comparison to weakening an opponent, it was still an impressive increase in strength.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan was similarly stunned. He knew that Di Qing managed to break through to Martial Saint grade within half a day, while Di Chen also managed to break through to Martial Saint grade within three days. According to Di Qing’s information, Qing Shui was an alchemist, an extremely powerful alchemist.</p>
 <p>He also knew better than anyone what kind of existence Old Madam Mo was. Back then, Old Madam Mo possessed formidable strength. Even though she wasn’t as strong now, she still was undeniably powerful.</p>
 <p>Considering that even Old Madam Mo was surprised by this young man, Di Xuan was delighted. He was Di Chen’s husband, if he could make Di Chen recognize him as her father again, he would become the ideal son-in-law.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the tiny black dot had become a red silhouette, flying towards them at an incredible speed.</p>
 <p>ROAARRRR!</p>
 <p>There was another resounding sound.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui kept his eyes on Old Demon Ba, who could already perceive the situation, the blood in his body slowly started boiling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed the nearby enormous and ferocious red Demonic Beast, the Red Jiao. This was the first time he saw a Jiao-type Demonic Beast, and it looked really mighty and stately, exuding a powerful aura.</p>
 <p>The Red Jiao looked like an enormous red lizard, a lizard with wings.It was also the most imposing Demonic Beast that Qing Shui has encountered so far. Its large, hideous head held a slight resemblance to a dragon, adding a hint of divinity.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui notice the old man on the Red Jiao’s back. The old man was burly like an iron tower, with his thick hair his most prominent feature. His snow white hair were so thick it resembled a lion’s mane, causing the old man to look like a mighty male lion.</p>
 <p>“Why were so cruel to my Ba Clan?”</p>
 <p>Hearing the old man’s words, Qing Shui felt relieved. After bottling his rage for such a long time, if Old Demon Ba didn’t get to vent his anger, he would explode. Although the people from Ba Clan wouldn’t be revived, venting was part of human nature.</p>
 <p>As long as the old man was able to vent his anger, it was to Qing Shui’s benefit. This helped Qing Shui gain some time as he secretly gathered his strength.</p>
 <p>“They deserved it. They ruthlessly bullied the weak. It is natural for them to have met their demise.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha……”</p>
 <p>Old Demon Ba started laughing again, laughing till he was hoarse and out of breath. He looked at Qing Shui, “So you are Qing Shui? The one who killed everyone in the Ba Clan?”</p>
 <p>“Your people from Ba Clan were the ones who seeked death. They travelled all the way to Green Cloud Continent just to kill me. Do you think they deserve to die?” Qing Shui answered calmly.</p>
 <p>“Di Xuan!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Old Demon Ba glared at Di Xuan and screamed furiously.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan was stunned from Old Demon Ba’s enraged scream. If not for the pressure being exerted by Old Demon Ba, those at Di Xuan’s cultivation level would normally not be affected by loud yells.</p>
 <p>As he recovered, he glanced towards Old Demon Ba: “What do you want to say? What’s the point of shouting like this.”</p>
 <p>“The Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord has always had a close relationship with the Di Clan. However, now the Di clan actually dares to collude with this brat? A brat still stinking of his mother’s milk can kill everyone from the Ba Clan? My eyes have not deteriorated, how could this brat achieve that with his negligible strength? Your Di Clan must have been the ones who did it! Why would you guys do that? Give me a reason!” Old Demon Ba roared, placing the blame on the Di Clan.</p>
 <p>“ Everyone in the city can vouch for the righteousness of the Di Clan. The Ba Clan on the other hand... Putting aside the fact that you guys played tricks the first time round, causing my daughter to suffer, your Ba Clan dared to barge in again and demand my second daughter to be married to you? Who do you think you are? Do you guys seriously think the Di Clan has no one to fight against you?” Di Xuan shouted loudly. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. There was no other solution, given that the situation has reached this point.</p>
 <p>“Fine, fine, we bullied your Di Clan when it was weak. Ever since that old bastard, Di Sha, died, there really wasn’t anyone strong in the Di Clan. Do you think you can deal with this with your current strength of Grade Eight Martial Saint?” Old Demon Ba snorted coldly while looking at Di Xuan.</p>
 <p>“With just the abilities of a Grade Eight Martial Saint, we can still kill you today.” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, I’ve heard rumors that you killed everyone from my clan. Regardless of the truth, I will make you suffer today. You don’t prove your strength with your words. No matter how eloquent you are, it cannot substitute for strength.”</p>
 <p>ROAAARRRR!</p>
 <p>The enormous Red Jiao was billowed on the ground, having the appearance of a cluster of fiery red clouds. The aura it exuded made people tremble with fear. It had a towering stature and an incomparably powerful body. Its sharp claws and teeth in particular made one feel goosebumps.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant with a flip of his hand.</p>
 <p>When next to the Red Jiao, the huge Diamond Gigantic Elephant seemed much smaller. However, it did not lose in terms of aura, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was unfazed by the Red Jiao in front of it.</p>
 <p>“Grade Two Martial Saint Demonic Beast? Are you trying to embarrass yourself?” Old Demon Ba mockingly laughed at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>“Don’t need to be so proud, you will be regretting it soon.” Qing Shui smiled as he took out the Violet Gold Divine Shield and Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>A faint golden light emerged from Qing Shui, emitting a faint pressure which could actually block the pressure that Old Demon Ba released. This made Di Xuan feel a lot more relaxed. Since Old Madam Mo was also a Grade Nine Martial Saint warrior, she wasn’t affected by Old Demon Ba’s pressure.</p>
 <p>One must know that a higher grade warrior was able to exert pressure on a lower grade warrior. This was the reason why there was a huge disparity between grades, with almost no possibility of a lower grade warrior defeating a higher grade warrior. There was already a large difference in physical strength. With the added pressure, there would basically be little to no chance for the lower grade warrior to overcome the difference in strength. When under the pressure, the lower grade warrior would not be able to display even 80% of his total strength.</p>
 <p>“Such a weird kid. To think that you could resist my pressure with your Grade Two Martial Saint abilities.” Old Demon Ba said, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you try enduring this then!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he took a step forward. He released his Emperor’s Qi and immediately locked it onto Old Demon Ba.</p>
 <p>His action caused changes to Old Demon Ba’s expression. Simultaneously, Qing Shui threw out the Demon Binding Ropes binding Old Demon Ba in an instant.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Old Demon Ba was released almost immediately after being bound, and the Demon Binding Ropes flew back to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Demon Binding Ropes failed…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t surprised. He was just testing his luck. After all, the level of the Demon Binding Ropes was too low. Thus it was normal to be unable to bind the opponent.</p>
 <p>Although the Demon Binding Ropes failed to bind Old Demon Ba, it managed to completely enrage him. With his strength lowered by a full nine hundred countries, Old Demon Ba currently had the strength of approximately three thousand and six hundred countries.</p>
 <p>To be immediately dropped from Grade Nine Martial Saint to Grade Eight Martial Saint, he furiously charged towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Old Demon Ba couldn’t wait to obliterate Qing Shui with one move. However, Di Xuan had long since shielded Qing Shui. With his strength of three thousand and five hundred countries combined with Qing Shui’s Godly Force and Divine Shield Talismans, Di Xuan’s strength had already slightly eclipsed Old Demon Ba’s.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui activated his Cloudmist Steps, rapidly retreating. The current him didn’t dare to directly face such a strong opponent. Otherwise, even if he wasn’t killed he would definitely be seriously injured.</p>
 <p>Seven Star Armoured Vest!</p>
 <p>Godly Armor Shield!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui instantly retreated, he used two of his defensive support techniques. In a flash, Qing Shui’s ability to resist hits was dramatically strengthened. However, this didn’t mean Qing Shui was invulnerable. From someone as strong as Old Demon Ba, an attack to the vitals would still be fatal. An impenetrable defence didn’t mean one was invulnerable. Just like how even though a kid couldn’t throw or hurt an adult, using a knife to pierce the adult’s throat or eyes will still severely injure or even kill him.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Di Xuan and Old Demon Ba collided with each other for the first time, both retreating three steps after the exchange. The agitated Qi in the air vibrated violently, causing a string of explosions.</p>
 <p>“Haha, how is the feeling of being unable to utilise your strength? Die!” The previous exchange made Di Xuan feel carefree. Being able to contend against someone originally a grade higher, how could he not feel comfortable?</p>
 <p>ROOOOOAAARRRRR!</p>
 <p>The Red Jiao gave out a heaven shaking roar and charged towards Di Xuan instantly.</p>
