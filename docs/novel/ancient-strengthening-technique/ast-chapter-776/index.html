 <p><strong>AST 776 - The Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death Against Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan (6)</strong></p>
 <p>With one move, the weakened old man had still managed to send Qing Shui flying, which made him spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood. The Seven Star defence was still not worth anything before the old man who had been weakened.</p>
 <p>That sparkling Dragon-Headed Cane gave Qing Shui tremendous pressure. He knew that it must be extremely powerful. He wasn’t sure if the old man had any other treasures on him.</p>
 <p>Supreme Treasure... If this Dragon-Headed Cane was not a Supreme Treasure, then he definitely had other Supreme Treasures on him. How should he decide his next move in this battle?</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast's speed with its unique traits had continually attacked the old man. However, Qing Shui knew that the Thunderous Beast couldn't take a single blow from the old man either. After all, the beast was still weak.</p>
 <p>Ning!</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird's black fireball was dissipated by the old man's Dragon-Headed Cane.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned as he wiped off the blood from the corner of his lips. It was impossible to use brute force if he wanted to win against this old man. The Seven Star Armored Vest only had seven and a half minutes of use. After the time had passed, the tremendous powers of the old man would increase several times and Qing Shui might get killed instantly.</p>
 <p>This was the result of the great difference in their powers. Before absolute power, everything was fleeting like rain and dust. The Thunderous Beast's thunderbolt attack had still some effect, but its speed was too slow. It was a pity that the Violet Lightning Strike had already been used and it would take another day before he could use it again.</p>
 <p>Another 24 hours... Qing Shui immediately called back the Thunderous Beast into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui had known of it before but not thought of it until now. He could only take the risk and try it out now. Other than that, there's no other way out.</p>
 <p>The time inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal compared to the time in the real world was 200:1. This meant that one day in the real world was equivalent to 200 days inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Since the Thunderous Beast could only use the Thunderbolt once every 24 hours, then 12 hours inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would be just a little less than 7.5 minutes, or 7.2 minutes to be more precise. The timing was just right for when the effect of the Seven Star Armored Vest was over.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui could only try to drag it out. He still had four Frosted Iron Balls and less than ten Coldsteel Needles which had been tempered with the five colored poison. He was having trouble even when he had used the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Instantaneous Diamond Evasion.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Qing Shui's Primordial Flame Balls could also put his opponent into a bad spot. The old man's battle experience and cultivation level was the strongest that Qing Shui had seen before, many things seemed to be useless against him.</p>
 <p>With a wave of his sleeve, a Coldsteel Needle shot out. The Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan's Old Ancestor was also on guard against Qing Shui's hidden weapons. Those were lethal objects which caught people unaware. Therefore, he had been trying to keep a safe distance from Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Another thing that he had sensed was Qing Shui's supporting techniques, especially those which could increase defence. All supporting defensive techniques had a restriction to them and could only be used once a day, for no longer than an hour. Usually, the duration would only be for about 30 minutes, with some could last for merely 15 minutes. However, this young man's supporting techniques were about to reach an hour. Therefore, he knew that they were going to disappear soon.</p>
 <p>When the time comes, he would be able to kill him with ease.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Coldsteel Needle was blocked but he closed in towards the old man once again. With a wave of his hand, he retreated with great speed and shot out a Primordial Flame Ball. The old man also retreated quickly, Qing Shui's attacks could not even touch him.</p>
 <p>He now knew why the people from his clan were not this young man's match, their gaps were too far. This young man not only looked powerful but more importantly, the things he knew were too many and each of them were all fatal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left an escape route for himself and not just one. However, he wasn't willing to take the risk easily. Unless he was forced with no other way out, he didn't want to try those extreme methods.</p>
 <p>Body Securing Talisman!</p>
 <p>Lost effect...</p>
 <p>It was a pity that he had yet to create any powerful Poison Talismans so far. Otherwise, he wouldn't be in such bad shape. The old man took the opportunity to strike with his cane again. Qing Shui had no time to deploy any other methods at all, moreover, the old man had inner armor protecting his vital parts.</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>At the moment they came into contact, Qing Shui used the Art of Pursuing.</p>
 <p>It decreased the opponent's speed by 20% and also increased the burden placed by 20%.</p>
 <p>At the old man's level, 20% was sufficient to drag him down for quite a while. Earlier, he had already been weakened too much. If not for the fact that he had quite a few good items on him, he would have probably died in Qing Shui's hands.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was once again sent flying, he couldn't help but feel impressed by how tough his body was. He had been spurting blood many times from the start and while he was in great pain all over, he could still bear with it.</p>
 <p>"Uncle, go for it... Ye Yan shouted out loudly in tears.</p>
 <p>It was very quiet in the Martial God Street. Looking at the tenacious young man in the air, they were all taken aback. Ye Huyan's hands were clenched together tightly, tears glistening in her eyes but none dropped.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya and the others had unknowingly clenched their fists together, tears flowed down their eyes and blood flowing out of their palms. If they were given the option of exchanging their lives for Qing Shui's, they would gladly do it. Qing Shui cannot die.</p>
 <p>In such a situation, they could only watch and feel anxious but to no avail. Seeing him covered in blood, they felt worse than anyone else. However, the faint smile on Qing Shui's face had caused a gnawing pain in everyone's heart.</p>
 <p>What was supporting him to be holding on like this? Many people did not understand.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he must not die. There were still many people who didn’t want him to die. All the things he couldn't let go of, including his family, his women and his own kids...</p>
 <p>"I'll see how much blood you still have to puke." The old man from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan created a series of shadows with his cane and sent them downwards as Qi explosions. The series of explosions in the air brought about a terrifying aura.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was sent flying once again. He had never felt before that time was passing so slowly. Earlier, he was still thinking that time had passed by too quickly, but now, everything was as if they were standing still, with seven and a half minutes being like an eternity.</p>
 <p>The old man didn't rush as he kept pushing Qing Shui back. He was also waiting for time to pass. As long as the effects of the supporting techniques on Qing Shui were gone, he would be able to kill him with great ease. In fact, the old man was also very confounded by how this young man could really take a beating. After his own level had been weakened, he could inflict heavy injuries on Qing Shui but they were not fatal.</p>
 <p>He had originally thought that after he consecutively inflicted such damage a few more times, he would be able to kill Qing Shui. However, he didn’t expect that Qing Shui's self-recovery abilities would be so terrifying. During the battle, he had also seen this young man taking some medicinal pills as well.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he chose to wait. In just a while, he would be able to kill the other party with great ease.</p>
 <p>However, he didn't know that Qing Shui was waiting as well. If he did, he'd definitely put in more effort or even take risks to eliminate Qing Shui while he had the upper hand right now. However, he only saw that this young man was struggling to hold on and didn't sense that his movements were still highly co-ordinated.</p>
 <p>Time passed by slowly, bit by bit. Qing Shui estimated that it was about time for the effects of the Seven Star Armored Vest to disappear soon. Whether he would win or lose would all depend on this. Although Qing Shui had a heaven-defying treasure like the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, it would be useless if he were to be instantly killed. Of course, the ones he was referring to were the Supreme Treasures for medicinal purposes.</p>
 <p>Supreme Treasures that could bring about defensive abilities for precautionary purposes. For example, they could be used to fend off fatal attacks or divert attacks. Qing Shui controlled his rhythm and called out for the Thunderous Beast concurrently, after a brief mental exchange with it.</p>
 <p>Just a little bit more!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's blood was boiling. Now that things had come this far, he hoped that the end would come quickly. After all, he could die at any moment. In this instant, his mind was turning very quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui trembled slightly, he was now very familiar with this feeling. This was a symptom of when the time for the Seven Star Armored Vest was up. However, when he felt it, his heart also trembled.</p>
 <p>The Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan's Old Ancestor could sense the changes to Qing Shui's body through his spiritual sense. He dashed toward Qing Shui with maniacal laughter, trying to whack him with his Pure Gold Dragon-Headed Cane, which created a series of shadows.</p>
 <p>"It's up, time's up."</p>
 <p>The moment the time for the Seven Star Armored Vest was up, Qing Shui instantaneously took out the Violet Gold Divine Shield and used the Godly Armor Shield.</p>
 <p>It could fend off half the impact of the attacks and could last for an hour.</p>
 <p>While it seemed that the effects of both the Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Seven Star Armored Vest were about the same, both had their advantages and disadvantages. The Seven Star Armored Vest could increase the body's sturdiness, as if tempering the body, increasing the strength of the body itself.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the Violet Gold Divine Shield fends off attacks and thus when he used the Violet Gold Divine Shield, he must not have any body contact with his opponents.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was sent flying back once again. This time around, the sound of his bones cracking was scary. The Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan's Old Ancestor didn't give Qing Shui any chance and dashed toward him once again.</p>
 <p>Come out!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hand to call out the Thunderous Beast while he also dashed toward the old man, biting back his pain.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>A huge Violet Lightning Strike shot out toward the old man. Qing Shui, as if prepared for a bloodbath, clenched his teeth and dashed out toward the old man. He sent two poison Frosted Iron Balls toward the old man. At almost the same time, countless Coldsteel Needles tempered in poison shot out toward the old man as well.</p>
 <p>The Violet Lightning Strike had managed to hit the old man which made Qing Shui heave a sigh of relief. He sped up even more but what happened next astonished him. The old man was not paralyzed, he had even easily knocked off the hidden weapons with his Dragon-Headed Cane. With the old man's cultivation level, it was a simple feat.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had used the Twin Dragon Explosions, the shattered pieces were not sufficient to harm the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan's Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to retreat but it was already too late. With a flash, the old man appeared before him, whacking down his four foot long Dragon-Headed Cane.</p>
 <p>"Why was the Violet Lightning Strike ineffective?"</p>
 <p>It was too late for Qing Shui to dodge now. There was no time to and he had no time to think of why the opponent was not paralyzed. He clenched his teeth and moved to receive the attack from the dragon cane head-on.</p>
 <p>Minute Subtlety!</p>
 <p>Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's hand hit the Dragon-Headed Cane at a terrifying frequency. In just a short moment, his palm had turned into a bloodied mess and the Violet Gold Divine Shield was returned to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>It was just a short moment. With his shoulder and the Thunder God, Qing Shui clamped down on the Dragon-Headed Cane which had lost most of its momentum. A series of sounds of his bones breaking rang out and his arm had been twisted horribly, with his ribs sunk in.</p>
