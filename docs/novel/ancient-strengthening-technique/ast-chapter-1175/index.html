 <p><strong>AST 1175 - Seventh Waves of the "Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm", City Lord Manor</strong></p>
 <p>Lion King's Imprint!</p>
 <p>Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>An astonishing power surged out from the tip of the Big Dipper Sword. That power had surpassed Qing Shui's expectation. A thought came to his mind as he carefully looked at the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm which he was launching.</p>
 <p>Although he was already mentally prepared, he was still shocked when he saw it!</p>
 <p>It was because, in that instant, what Qing Shui had sent out toward the old man was seven huge golden Buddha hand prints. Moreover, the seven golden Buddha hand prints formed a shape that was like a huge lotus flower, covering up the old man.</p>
 <p>Confinement!</p>
 <p>His Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm had attained a breakthrough unexpectedly...</p>
 <p>The old man was confined just like that. Of course Qing Shui wouldn't go easy on him and swung the Big Dipper Sword once again.</p>
 <p>Wood Vines, bloodthirsty demonic vines!</p>
 <p>The huge wood vines rose up, entangling the old man. However, it wasn't able to break through the old man's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation immediately. Qing Shui let go of Yan Jinyu.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu could only barely be considered a Grade Two State Master or rather, it was because of the enhancement she received from the weapon that she was one step away from attaining Grade Two State Master. However, she was incomparable to this old man who excelled in speed and was a true blue Grade Two State Master.</p>
 <p>The Wood Vines continued to entangle and attack relentless. From this battle, Qing Shui had also gained a new and more accurate understanding of his powers. Moreover, the prowess of the seventh wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm had an increment of more than tenfold compared to when it was only at the sixth wave. To think that it could actually confine the old man...</p>
 <p>It seemed like the seventh wave was also a crucial point, just like the Ancient Strengthening Technique's seventh layer. This belong to the higher stage in the later phase and would provide a tremendous qualitative increase to one's strength.</p>
 <p>"Lad, you won't be able to get through my Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. By doing this, you're expending a lot of your spirit energy and when it has completely dried up, it'll be time for you to die!" The old man bellowed out while he was trapped in the bloodthirsty demonic vines.</p>
 <p>"I shall see how long your Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation can last!"</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his hand and the area around the bloodthirsty demonic vines became like a piece of ocean with huge whirlpools and fluctuating waves. Qing Shui raised his hands again.</p>
 <p>Monstrous Wave!</p>
 <p>Many black holes, black whirlpools, exuded a terrifying engulfing prowess!</p>
 <p>Water brings growth to wood!</p>
 <p>The appearance of the Tidal Cloud Waves Seal caused the bloodthirsty demonic vines to have become even more powerful. They continued to twist about, entangle and lash out. Qing Shui's control of his spirit energy was considered quite powerful.</p>
 <p>The old man continued to shout, as if attempting to agitate Qing Shui, making the latter anxious so that he would have the opportunity to make his escape.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu watched from the side as the old man was tangled up by the bloodthirsty demonic vines. Even if she wanted to attack, there was nothing she could do. She could only watch from the side, not knowing how to describe the overwhelming astonishment she was feeling.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the bloodthirsty demonic vines exuded a powerful aura and brilliant violet light. There was a blood red glow in the violet light. The old man let out a terrible cry and after a strange series of sounds rang out, there was nothing but silence.</p>
 <p>The Big Dipper Sword's 20% chance of doubling the attacking prowess had appeared. The doubling of attacking prowess included spirit energy attacks. Under the confinement of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, the bloodthirsty demonic vines' had their attacking prowess doubled and they managed to breakthrough the old man's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. With his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation broken through, the old man wasn't worth a mention. Qing Shui was very clear how scary the bloodthirsty demonic vines were.</p>
 <p>Clearing out the Nine Palace positioning, Qing Shui picked up the weapon and the interspatial silk sachet the old man had dropped. The interspatial silk sachet was a high quality one and hadn't been destroyed by the bloodthirsty demonic vines.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Yang Yicun was slowly moving back.</p>
 <p>"There's no way you can escape. Come back!" Qing Shui reached out his hand and a huge water current entangled Yang Yicun. With a shake, Yang Yicun was brought right next to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Yang Yicun's face was extremely pale and he looked as if he was about to burst into tears. He had lived a luxurious life since he was young, getting whatever he wanted. His talent wasn't bad either but the only thing was that he had yet to encounter any setbacks before. It was the first time he had encountered such a situation and even the two powerful Elders who had doted on him the most had died. He knew that he was doomed. However, he was scared of death or rather the terror before death itself.</p>
 <p>Death wasn't scary but the process leading to death and the fear one had toward death was what that was scary!</p>
 <p>"Speak up! Which other clans are working together with you to deal with Yan Clan. If you lie, I'll let you have a taste of what that old man earlier went through. It should be very comfortable to get entangled by the demonic vines." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Yang Yicun.</p>
 <p>"I'll talk, I'll talk!" Yang Yicun quickly said. At the mention of the bloodthirsty demonic vines, his face had turned even more pale.</p>
 <p>"Miss Yan has an idea what's going on and will be able to tell if you lie. If we feel that you're not speaking the truth, I'll put you through the demonic vines. Moreover, there's still Soul Search. You've heard about that, right?" Qing Shui's calm words sounded like the most terrifying words in Yang Yicun's mind.</p>
 <p>"It's Yu Clan, it's Yu Clan..." Yang Yicun shouted!</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu shuddered, "To think that it's Yu Clan. It's no wonder Yang Clan dares to take action."</p>
 <p>"Are there any other aristocratic clans taking part?" Qing Shui put aside Yu Clan and asked Yang Yicun.</p>
 <p>"I don't know, I really don't know. Don't kill me, I don't wish to die..." Yang Yicun broke into tears, with snot flowing out from his nose.</p>
 <p>Back in Yang Clan Inn, Qing Shui had experienced first hand how cold this guy's gaze could be. He was of quite a decent level of cultivation too. It was a pity that Qing Shui detested people like him. It was because Yang Yicun wasn't a guy who knew when to yield and when not to. He was a person who would be arrogant when he had the upper hand and was like a coward when he didn't.</p>
 <p>Yang Yicun died. People like him couldn't be left alive. For some people, it wasn't that their lives would be spared as long as they didn't resist. Qing Shui only let him die a faster death. He then took a look a look at the scene and then toward Yan Jinyu, saying, "Let's go. People will be coming very soon."</p>
 <p>"Mmmm!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and left the place with Yan Jinyu. There was still some time before the second day arrived. Seeing that Yan Jinyu was not herself, he asked, "Is Yu Clan very powerful?"</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu let out a sigh, "Yu Clan is very powerful. Everyone knows that Yu Clan is very mysterious but usually don't have many interactions with others. To others, they are more like a secluded aristocratic clan. I hadn't expected them to set their eyes on Yan City."</p>
 <p>"Can Yan Clan not win against Yu Clan?" Qing Shui felt that Yan Clan shouldn't be simple either. After all, they could stand at the top of Yan City for many years.</p>
 <p>Although for the past few years, their development had been slow, they should still have strong foundations.</p>
 <p>"I'm not sure. Our clan is also very wary of the Yu Clan. Most important, they shouldn't have gotten to know that the Yu Clan is intending to take action against the Yan Clan. We must rush to bring news back to them before they take action so that we can do the necessary preparation." Yan Jinyu seemed a little anxious, seeming as if she couldn't wait to return to Yan Clan immediately.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, we've asked earlier. Yu Clan hasn't taken action against Yan Clan yet. We'll be able to arrive at Yan Clan first thing in the morning tomorrow," Qing Shui assured her.</p>
 <p>Very soon, the next day was here. Calling back his demonic beast, Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>After eight consecutive times, they arrived in Yan City's inner city. Although it was still nighttime, the inner city seemed to be even brighter. Compared to the outer city, it was more prosperous, the population was more dense and the buildings here were especially big and tall. Big buildings had several tens of stories and were majestic like castles.</p>
 <p>The city had an even more rustic feeling and large sized demonic beasts would fly past in the air every now and then. Those auras shocked Qing Shui. The place had a lot of hidden talents and the strong factions were even more concentrated here.</p>
 <p>Although they had arrived at the inner city, they were still a distance away from the City Lord Manor. Yan Jinyu called out her own demonic beast, the Xuantian Wind Crane. It was a very good mount but its battle prowess was ordinary.</p>
 <p>The Xuantian Wind Crane moved at its greatest speed toward the City Lord Manor. Qing Shui didn't say a word on the way but just closed his eyes and rested. He was actually sensing his Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p>Earlier, before he had attained a breakthrough to the seventh wave, what he hit out would all be struck out in a row. Right now, the prowess of the seventh wave had not only increased by a lot, it could also change positions.</p>
 <p>The seventh wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was strongest in term of its confinement powers. Of course, its damaging prowess was quite good as well. However, he didn't know why the old man ended up being confined back then. Since it was a rare opportunity, he followed up to kill with his Wood Vines.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui planned on entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to cultivate his Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm after they had arrived at the inner city. This, combined with his Wood Vines, would be a good ultimate technique.</p>
 <p>The appearance of the second form of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation caused Qing Shui to feel pressured. If it was a Peak Grade Two State Master, Qing Shui would probably be unable to do anything even if the opponent stood there and did nothing.</p>
 <p>Power. This was power. Before absolute power, everything else was weak and useless. However, Qing Shui still had hope. The Heaven Secrets Pill Yan Jinyu had given him could increase his abilities by a lot.</p>
 <p>City Lord Manor!</p>
 <p>This was also where Yan Clan was located. When the sky was just starting to lighten, they could already see the manor from afar. The City Lord Manor took up a very big plot of land, with a length and width of not less than ten Li. There were many tall pavilion buildings, arenas, artificial mountains, lakes and even rivers...</p>
 <p>The Xuantian Wind Crane landed at the entrance to the City Lord Manor. This was a regulation. After keeping the Xuantian Wind Crane, Yan Jinyu headed into the manor with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Young Miss!"</p>
 <p>The two rows of guards greeted Yan Jinyu respectfully when they saw her.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu waved her hand and led Qing Shui to the hall which wasn't far away. These people stationed at the City Lord Manor's entrance were all very strong. Most of the time, the people who would come would be either married ladies or kids. The arenas and martial halls and other things were located at the backyard.</p>
 <p>Quite a number of people passed through the City Lord Manor's courtyard. Most of them were servants. It was still early after all. There were also people who were cultivating. Yan Jinyu led Qing Shui directly to the hall.</p>
 <p>If Yan Jinyu hadn't been mistaken, her father should be cultivating in the main hall!</p>
 <p>Four middle-aged men stood at the entrance to the hall.</p>
 <p>"Young Miss!"</p>
 <p>"Is father in?" Yan Jinyu asked directly.</p>
 <p>"The clan's head is in! He said that when you returned, you can enter directly!" a capable looking middle-aged man quickly said.</p>
 <p>"This person cannot enter!" Another man stopped Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"He's not an outsider. Alright, I have something to discuss with father," Yan Jinyu didn't show her anger but just said calmly.</p>
 <p>With that, she grabbed Qing Shui's sleeve and entered!</p>
 <p>The main hall was the greatest hall in the City Lord Manor. In the front hall, there were documents as well many tables and chairs. It should be the place where the clan would hold meetings. Usually, the City Lord could also deal with some work here.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu brought Qing Shui in. This main hall was made from Metallic Crystal Stones and was especially sturdy. Most training chambers would tend to be made from such materials.</p>
 <p>Upon entering deeper, Qing Shui realized that it was much bigger in here than it was outside. This place was a training ground. It was empty, tall and wide. Right now, he could see that there was a man standing in the distance. Qing Shui had only seen him after sensing him. It was because that person was exuding a profound essence.</p>
