 <p><strong>AST 1067 - A Promised Fight, Mixture, A Complicated Wenren Wu-shuang</strong></p>
 <p>Many onlookers were filled with envy when they saw Qing Shui being surrounded by beautiful women. They wanted to switch position with Qing Shui so badly, even the man in the violet robe was unconvinced about what he had seen. He felt that Qing Shui’s status was suddenly boosted after being surrounded by these women, he didn’t feel that way before when he first met him. However, with the sudden change of Qing Shui’s whole demeanor, the man in the violet robe felt that his opponent was more than capable of retaliating his demands in an instant.</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to know my status in the Violet Dragon Mountain. I am more than able to represent the Violet Dragon Mountain. I don’t know if you’re brave enough to accept the duel of life and death against me.” The man in the violet robe said in a clear voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he could not evade the topic any longer because this man had mentioned before that his wife was the third daughter of the Beiming Clan. From the moment the man in the violet robe decided to stand out in the public, this matter could no longer be settled pleasantly.</p>
 <p>“Battle against you? Sure, I will accept. But I’m busy at the moment. Let’s make it this way, after we’ve come out of the Ancient Ruins, we will begin our battle of life and death once and for all. How about it?” Qing Shui said with a grin.</p>
 <p>After he listened to what Qing Shui had to say, the man in the violet robe smiled and said: “Good. Then that’s settled. After coming out from the Ancient Ruins, we will have a battle until one of us dies.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui practically stole what the man in the violet robe had yearned to say. However, this man was the one who had issued the challenge first, so if Qing Shui accepted his challenge, then Qing Shui would be the one to decide the location and time of the battle. This was one of those unwritten rules commonly practiced in the world of martial arts.</p>
 <p>The man in the violet robe took away his men and left. His expression wasn’t pleasant because he was unsatisfied after he saw the smug look on Qing Shui’s face. He felt that Qing Shui had everything under control, as if this challenge didn’t bother him at all.</p>
 <p>The man preferred for him to be the smug one rather than his opponents having the confidence he desired. This challenge meant everything to him as this was the biggest battle and breakthrough he would be able to achieve. Everything he did had something to do with his position in the Violet Dragon Mountain in the future.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went ahead then greeted the members of the Demon Gate before he took the ladies and Little Fatty toward the tents he had already set up. The surrounding area around the tents had the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation performed on them earlier by Qing Shui himself.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang’s power had been advancing quite swiftly. Despite so, she still couldn’t reach a breakthrough to Martial Emperor. She was very close to achieving that, yet she couldn’t do it. This was one of the concerns Qing Shui had with her. If only she had the power as strong as Yu He, no one would be able to change her mind that easily.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui finally found the power she needed. Moreover, in a place like this, gaining a bit of power would ensure her safeguard from those who wished to harm her. In any case, he took Wenren Wu-shuang along with him and left their tents immediately with the Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>Besides, they were going to take a short while outside the formation. Even if someone wanted to do anything bad to them, the formation would cause the perpetrator to think twice about their actions. Moreover, the ladies were not weak to begin with. Their knowledge on formations had expanded further and stronger at this point.</p>
 <p>The relationship between Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-shuang was quite mysterious. He had already treated her as his woman and she also had never thought of marrying to someone else. They almost copulated once, but even so they only had to take one more step to reach a higher level of their relationship. Her body had been touched by him and he had also kissed her before. However, it was the last key point of their relationship that she pushed him away out of fear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that she had her reasons but decided against on asking her about it. If she wanted to tell him, she would do it eventually. If she didn’t want to tell her reasons, forcing her would be meaningless. He never had that kind of intention against her. Everyone has secrets, including himself.</p>
 <p>For this course of acupuncture, she had to be completely naked in front of him. She was extremely shy to the point she had no place to hide her shame. Qing Shui only took a bit of advantage of her but that was about it. Because of the last incident, he managed to constrain himself from going overboard. He felt that she still need time to open herself to him completely.</p>
 <p>After that, everything went smoothly. The medicinal pills and Hallow Pellet allowed Wenren Wu-shuang to fire up her body constitution which had increased her power exponentially. Qing Shui had already prepared weapons and medicinal pills for her as soon as her powers had been upgraded.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang’s training had allowed her powers and cultivation realm to increase in a tremendous amount. Despite so, she didn’t think that she would break through to Martial Emperor in just half a day’s time. Her powers as a Martial Emperor had also shoot up in an abrupt amount as well.</p>
 <p>This was only possible because of this man. She stared at him, who seemed like a stranger to her, yet also someone who had left a deep scar in her heart. She tried to remember everything about him and everything flashed into her mind as if she was reliving the past.</p>
 <p>She had given him the permission to pursue her a long time ago. As long as he was able to defeat her in a battle, he could pursue her as he pleased. After that, she promised him that she would give herself five years before she would agree to marry him.</p>
 <p>That five years had already passed a long time ago. He never forced her to give him an answer because he said that he would rather wait until she was ready to become his wife willingly. Qing Shui had fulfilled every condition she had asked him. Most importantly, he was able to avenge her elder sister by killing the man who had caused her death.</p>
 <p>They were now in a lone mountain, their surrounding was covered in ice and snow. Even though this was a lone mountain, it wasn’t filled with a single drop of snow within the 500 hundred meters proximity. Because of that, the lonely mountain seemed lonelier and quieter than before.</p>
 <p>She could feel a stream of powerful Qi circulating in her body, a sensation that she had felt before in the Hundred Miles City. She used to be one of the most powerful existences in the Hundred Miles City, right now, the same sensation slowly flowed back to her mind. At that moment, her aura had undergone a slight miraculous change that she hadn't expected of or dreamt about.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m now a Martial Emperor.” Wenren Wu-shuang excitedly squeezed Qing Shui’s hand as she said in a happy voice.</p>
 <p>“I see. Young miss is indeed unparalleled in this world. You must dominate the other four continents in the future. A small Martial Emperor was an effortless feat for a lady such as you.” Qing Shui congratulated her while making a joke. Wenren Wu-shuang was one of the women in the Portraits of Beauty. Breaking through to Martial Emperor was destined to happen sooner or later.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you still going to the other four continents?” Wenren Wu-shuang could tell that he had some other intentions, as she listened to his words carefully.</p>
 <p>“Not only am I going, I want everyone to go as well.” Qing Shui smiled while he locked his hands with hers.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m still far from qualified to go now. It seems that the chances of me going to the other continents is getting slimmer.” There was an indescribable sincerity in Wenren Wu-shuang’s eyes as she looked at him. He couldn’t tell what she was thinking either.</p>
 <p>“Wu-shuang, promise me. If you ever want to go somewhere, please tell me. I was really worried about you.” Qing Shui released his grasp on her hands and embraced her from her waist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t help but sniffled when a subtle scent of fragrance traveled to his nose: “Smells nice!”</p>
 <p>“What smells nice?” Wenren Wu-shuang asked as she held onto his shoulders. However, she quickly lowered her head when she realized what he meant by his remarks. She was too quick to ask him that question.</p>
 <p>“My Wushuang smells nice. Let me have a bite!” Qing Shui chuckled closely to her ears.</p>
 <p>“How are you going to take that bite?” Wenren Wu-shuang’s heart was beating fast. Perhaps it was because she could finally see Qing Shui or perhaps there were other reasons that caused her to ask that in an impulse.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was shocked and felt his blood flushing to his face. He looked at Wenren Wu-shuang, whose cheeks were flushed with rosy red as well. Without hesitation, he leaned closer and said softly: “Let me take a bite here. I’ve yearned for these.”</p>
 <p>While he whispered those words in her ears, his hands were already touching her perky bosoms. He had kissed and tasted those bosoms before but that was a long time ago.</p>
 <p>“Ah, don’t move around….” Wenren Wu-shuang was a virgin after all. Her hands held onto Qing Shui’s neck, as she cried out in surprise.</p>
 <p>“I won’t move around. I’ll just move here, I will not touch anything else.” Qing Shui bit her earlobes gently, as he whispered into her ears.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang was too embarrassed to speak, so she firmly held onto Qing Shui in silence. She could feel the warmth of his touch as his hands fondled her breasts, which caused her breathing to accelerate and heart to beat fast. Despite that, her expression became more and more desolated when she thought about herself.</p>
 <p>Because of her situation, she felt increasingly grieved the more she thought about it. But she could not tell Qing Shui anything, at least not for the time being.</p>
 <p>“Are you done touching yet?” Exclaimed Wenren Wu-shuang as she halted Qing Shui’s hands from creeping into her clothes.</p>
 <p>“Not yet. It will never be enough. Why don’t you let me take a bite or two?” said Qing Shui as he tilted her jaw to get a good look at this woman with rosy cheeks.</p>
 <p>“You are a bastard, so don’t even think about it. Come on, let’s go back. Look, the sun’s already going down.” said Wenren Wu-shuang as she gave him a deep glare.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only said it without any other intentions because he couldn’t forget that fateful day with her. Under that circumstance, he couldn’t make her his woman, so he didn’t force her back then, even today. He believed that she would personally tell him everything one day.</p>
 <p>He used the Nine Continents Steps and returned to everyone. The others could already make out what had happened with one look at Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-shuang. However, Yu He was particularly shocked when she noticed that Wenren Wu-shuang had changed drastically after just a brief moment apart. The change was so drastic that she couldn’t accept that it was true.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, come. I know what you wanted to say but you’ll understand a bit later.” Qing Shui greeted the others before he took Yu He away. He could still use the Nine Continents Steps two more times.</p>
 <p>This time, he took her to the same place, but the sky was already dark. There wasn’t much time left and he still needed to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal later on. It wasn’t that long after he had consumed the Hallow Pellet, which was why he was being impatient and in a hurry.</p>
 <p>Time was short, but Yu He’s power could still manage to surge dramatically. The benefit of that was extensive because in this place, any power surged would be unlimited.</p>
 <p>Currently, Qing Shui wasn’t sure about Yu He’s exact power, but he could tell that she was definitely powerful. He was still quite curious about her Hundred Flowers Secret Techniques due to its immense strength and he was beginning to wonder if she has the rare Hundred Flowers Body. One could say that her cultivation of the Hundred Flowers Secret Techniques had a tremendous advancement pace.</p>
 <p>“This medicinal pellet is very powerful. Thank you Qing Shui.” Yu He held tightly onto Qing Shui’s hand happily. Their relationship had reached an unknown stage after their last parting with each other in the Central Continent.</p>
 <p>In the past, Qing Shui had allowed Yu He to follow him, but he felt that he was being insincere at that time. Yu He would never want a relationship built from pity, which was why they were able to become friends in the early stage of their lives for nearly 20 years. Yet, they could only be considered as confidants to each other.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, is your attack based mainly on the usage of spiritual energy?” Qing Shui asked after he pondered for a while.</p>
 <p>“My strongest move is a psychic-based attack or you can say that it is related to the physics of things.” Yu He replied. She felt an indescribable emotion in her chest as she watched Qing Shui hold onto her hand tightly.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, do you still remember those days in the Hundred Miles City?” Qing Shui asked, as he led Yu He by hand and walked around nonchalantly in this barren mountain.</p>
 <p>“I will never ever forget about that. Those days were the most precious memories in my mind. I have to think about the times in the Hundred Miles City just so I could sleep every day. I miss those days, but they will never come back.” Yu He looked into the distance while she spoke with a mature yet pleasant voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart throbbed and his hands were shaking, which caused him to unconsciously apply a bit more force on his grip. Yu He did mention that she wouldn’t marry anyone else. With her current qualification after all these years, she could find any men if she wanted to. He already had a few women by his side, yet she remained faithful to her determination and waited for him patiently to return her feelings.</p>
