 <p><strong>AST 669 - Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death (7)</strong></p>
 <p>There were many people, who felt sorry for Qing Shui and the Di Clan. After all, they had a pretty good reputation. Furthermore, most of the crowd hated poison, but they could not afford to antagonize the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, thus, they kept this hatred within their hearts. With regards to the members of the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect, most people would choose to avoid them if they could.</p>
 <p>“How are we going to fight?” Di Xuan frowned and looked towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a bit uncertain since he could not sense the exact strength of their opponents. However, the weakest one seemed to have the strength of 7500 countries…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would not give up, he even had a plan in mind, he was still able to deal with the old man, who had the strength of 7500 countries, it would not even prove troublesome. The difficult part laid in the ability of the other two, but as long as they weren't peak Martial Saints, Qing Shui would not admit defeat. At this moment, he was scrutinizing about how to combo his abilities into creating the most destructive effect possible.</p>
 <p>It would be a dream come true if he could instantly kill one of them during his opening assault.</p>
 <p>His main worry was the poison they used and the poison beasts they planned to unleash upon them. Although the opponent's level of strength was quite scary, the poison and beast were way more terrifying. The most important thing was, that he did not know what types of poison beasts the opponent had.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, come up!” Qing Shui preemptively rode the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Currently, the only thing he could use was the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s perversely strong technique, Instantaneous Diamond Evasion. However, it was not certain how long would they be able to last.</p>
 <p>Old Madam Mo and Di Xuan did not dare to be slow, they rapidly climbed onto the back of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
 <p>“Hang on tight, we will observe the situation first. Don't go down before I tell you to.” Qing Shui said worriedly.</p>
 <p>“En, we will!”</p>
 <p>“Young man, you are the most outstanding youth I have seen in so many years, it is truly an eye opener. With your current level of strength and mystical abilities, those excellent disciples of the super clans wouldn't be stronger than you one bit.” The black-haired man said gently, his voice seemed to be powerful and resonating.</p>
 <p>There was a subtle rhythm to the man's metallic voice as if it was filled with some kind of magic, causing people, who listened to it feel calm, creating a sensation like they could not build up any strength.</p>
 <p>Hypnosis?</p>
 <p>The Yin-Yang Image in Qing Shui’s sea of consciousness was spinning rapidly, it quickly dispersed that sensation. Qing Shui noticed that Old Madam Mo and Di Xuan beside him looked pretty drowsy, which verified his guess.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The roar of the Tiger’s form caused Old Madam Mo and Di Xuan to wake up immediately. Both of them were drenched in cold sweat, the more they thought about it, the more frightened they felt. This kind of mental attack was difficult to defend against.</p>
 <p>“Prepare the Gale Pellet!” Qing Shui quietly said. At the same time, he took out a stack of Heavenly Talismans, the fastest one was the Descending Heavens Talisman. Qing Shui discovered that it was very difficult for the opponent to dodge it.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>This Time, Qing Shui got the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to activate a debuffing technique. This was one of Qing Shui’s trump cards, he made use of this opportunity to utilize it.</p>
 <p>The Vajra Subdues Demons debuffed those in a certain range, any target within the range would be debuffed and it was not limited to a single individual but the maximum number of five.</p>
 <p>Si Si…...</p>
 <p>A Three-Headed Dark Flame Python hissed, its body pounced towards Qing Shui in a flash. That huge body spat out a dense black fog, the terrifying atmosphere caused one’s scalp to go numb. That fog had an intense corrosive effect, for this kind of corrosive poison, the stronger its effect, the more fear it inspired. Even some mystical items were unable to withstand soaking in it for an extended period of time, no need to even mention the results it produced then it got in contact with flesh and blood.</p>
 <p>Ji Ji!</p>
 <p>Shua Shua!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui commanded the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to evade but the speed of the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python was not inferior at all. The contraction and extension speed of the python's front half wasn't any slower than the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion. The most important thing was, that the person on the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python was extremely dangerous.</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Using the brief opportunity, Qing Shui executed the Fiery Golden Eyes. The Vajra Subdues Demons of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant required a short time to activate, but Qing Shui’s Fiery Golden Eyes and Emperor's Qi could be instantly activated on the target, as long as the distance did not exceed a hundred meters.</p>
 <p>“Swallow the Gale Pellet, quickly flee!” Qing Shui said urgently.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui shouted, he quickly took out the Soulshake Bell that he had not used in a while. He unhesitatingly shook it at the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python.</p>
 <p>The soul-shaking spirit-piercing sound was no longer the same as it was in the past, the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python was caught off guard and started trembling due to the effects of the Soulshake Bell, it could not control its body as it slid down by tens of meters.</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, Qing Shui decisively rode the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and used the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>In a flash, he arrived at the middle section of the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python's body, he was just about 30 meters away from the position of the three old men. Almost instantaneously, under Qing Shui’s orders, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant executed the Mighty Elephant Stomp. At the same time, Qing Shui jumped onto the body of the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python. As he descended, he executed the Mighty Elephant Stomp.</p>
 <p>Bang Bang!</p>
 <p>Ka Ca Ca…...</p>
 <p>Si Si…...</p>
 <p>The two sounds resounded loudly almost simultaneously, it was then accompanied by an intense blood-curdling screech and the sound of bones breaking. Before the pitiful Three-Headed Dark Flame Python could use its strongest move, it was already disabled, that mournful screech seemed to have an emotion of intense dissatisfaction mixed within.</p>
 <p>Although their strengths were not equal, the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python, that was weakened by Qing Shui, was not able to withstand such a huge blow, causing the enormous python body to break right in the middle.</p>
 <p>The black blood caused a fishy smell to fill the air, the bottom half of the python’s body rapidly fell towards the ground. Qing Shui evaded by quickly climbing back on top of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>After he used the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion to evade, Qing Shui intended to disable this Three-Headed Dark Flame Python. After all, the huge poison beast in the air represented a hidden danger.</p>
 <p>A sharp whine rang out, followed by the sound of the lower half of the python hitting the ground, as well as whooping and screaming of the crowd. After all, a lot of poisonous blood rained from the sky.</p>
 <p>Xiu Xiu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui evaded two pink arrows, he took a glance and saw that it was shot by the weakest old man. From the start to disabling the Three-Headed Dark Flame Python, he only needed two breaths of time.</p>
 <p>The old man with black hair, who was wearing black clothes took out his weapon, a large sickle. This sickle appeared to be extraordinary, it was even more insidious than the Psychotic Demon Scythe from earlier.</p>
 <p>Evil Dragon Tooth!</p>
 <p>Legends had it that the blade of this weapon was refined from the tooth of an evil dragon, the evil dragon was a kind of a poison dragon, the tooth was the sharpest and most poisonous thing on its entire body. As to whether the evil dragon was a true dragon, Qing Shui did not know but the evil dragon was an existence, that was stronger than the poison dragon.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui knew that he could not let this evil dragon Tooth touch his body because he could sense dangerous air surrounding it.</p>
 <p>The weapon of the other elder was actually a coiled rope, it was jet-black and it had some strange white moving animal pictures. They were of famous poison bugs and poison beasts.</p>
 <p>Poisonous coiled rope?</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qing Shui saw that there were a few other poison beasts. The Three-Headed Dark Flame Python from earlier was already disabled, he did not see it anywhere within the vicinity so he judged that it was probably taken to safety a moment ago.</p>
 <p>Six-Eared Poisonous Heavenly Mouse!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed, that beside one of the old men, was a demonic beast of about three meters in size. Its shape resembled a mouse and it had six ears. Its whole body was blue. Such a big mouse could inspire fear in some people.</p>
 <p>There were also two ice martens, these were famous poison beasts. They were good at ice attribute assault and their attacks carried an icy poison, those who were affected by it would gradually become slower and slower.</p>
 <p>At the black haired man's side were two demonic beasts, that were two meters wide. They looked like butterflies, one was golden, the other was silver, they were extremely beautiful.</p>
 <p>Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies? Early Martial Saint Gold Silver Colored Butterflies?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui squinted his eyes, in the Poison Scriptures, there were ten great mutated poison beasts, these Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies were one of them. The Poison Scriptures recorded that out of every million of Colored Butterflies, there would only be one pair of Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies. The Colored Butterflies were ordinary poison beasts, they weren’t that frightening, but once they became the mutated Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies, they would be incomparably stronger, their abilities would also directly reach the peak of Martial King.</p>
 <p>The two-meter wide Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies actually had the abilities of an early Martial Saint. The frightening thing about the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies was their Petrifying Poison. It could scatter a kind of poisonous powder, instantly causing a person to go rigid and unable to move, there was no way to defend against it and cultivators whose abilities were insufficient would be petrified forever.</p>
 <p>Their only weakness was that their activation time was long and they were quite slow. The best way for the butterflies to use the poisonous powder was to cooperate with other poison beasts or cultivators, or else it would be very difficult to find an opportunity to affect those with Martial Saint abilities and above.</p>
 <p>The entire body of Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies was poisonous, furthermore, it was that kind of terrible poison. Thus, even demonic beast or human cultivator with higher cultivation realms would not dare to go near them. Although their speed was described as slow, they were only relatively slow compared to those faster than them.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Emperor's Qi instantly locked onto all the targets in front of him. Soon, the old man with the strength of 7500 countries had his prowess reduced by the amount of 150 countries by the Descending Heavens Talisman, the amount of 735 countries by Vajra Subdues Demons, the amount of 1000 countries by Fiery Golden Eyes, the amount of 1500 countries by Emperor's Qi, finally leaving him with about the strength of 4200 countries…...</p>
 <p>Of the remaining two, the old man with white hair was left with the strength of 5200 countries, the old man with black hair dressed in black clothing actually still retained the strength of 6300 countries.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew, that there were some strange treasures on the opponent’s body, or else it would be impossible for him to still have such strength before reaching the peak of the Martial Saint realm.</p>
 <p>Maybe because the methods Qing Shui used to kill the Phantom Fire Wolf were too strange, there were no lone poison beasts coming forward to attack. However, that black haired old man, who was the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect's sect master, slashed at Qing Shui with the Evil Dragon Tooth.</p>
 <p>That simple move had a skillful grace to it, it was tyrannically sharp!</p>
 <p>Combination Sword Technique!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was struck backward, he could barely withstand the opponent’s attack with the protection of the Seven Star Armored Vest. Di Xuan was already battling with the weakest old man, Old Madam Mo was also battling evenly with the other one, just that the poison beasts of the opponent were yet to make their move.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt anxious in his heart, this was only the beginning, but he was already weary from dealing with the attacks of the black haired old man. The Evil Dragon Tooth slashed towards Qing Shui once again, every time it struck the Violet Gold Divine Shield, Qing Shui’s entire body got blasted backward.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was sent flying backward once again, but this time his direction was aimed toward the place, where Di Xuan was battling with one of the old men. Qing Shui suddenly turned his body around and pounced on that old man.</p>
 <p>“Kid! You dare!” the black haired old man showed a trace of shock in his expression and hatred flickered in his eyes for the first time.</p>
