 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon arriving in the Nine Continents, Qing Shui finally felt that he was a true cultivator. In the eyes of a cultivator, the most important belief was fate. Fate was an ethereal and unexplainable force, but he also believed in karma and the cyclical nature of retribution. It wasn’t quite blind faith, but something he could explain empirically with science.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some things Qing Shui did were not for payment. This was the case with Big Tiger. Sure, the “cause” was the Treasure Basin that Big Tiger had given to him, but his “effect” on Big Tiger was also enormous. He nursed Big Tiger’s mother back to health, something that was comparable to a great gift such as the Treasure Basin, enough to gain Big Tiger’s everlasting gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui would not act so slyly. In this expansive world, the number of people you met would be a mere drop in the bucket of all the people in the world. As such, Qing Shui would try his best to treat others well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!” Big Tiger spotted Qing Shui and bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This place isn’t too bad, right?” Qing Shui said as he gave Big Tiger a pat on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, as the New Year slowly passed by, the festive atmosphere would slowly die down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very good, Master, very good. There is something I want to ask,” Big Tiger said sheepishly, unable to pluck up the courage to approach Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was confused. Big Tiger was usually rather straightforward and it was rather rare to see him as timid as he was. Big Tiger’s face was as red as a plump, ripe tomato, with beads of sweat trickling down his face. Upon seeing this, Qing Shui knew at once what was going on and chuckled as he teased, “Is this about some girl you met?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master is too farsighted. I can’t hide anything from you. This humble disciple would like to ask for your advice,” Big Tiger said immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How am I supposed to give you advice when you haven’t told me anything about this girl yet? Moreover, this is a decision that you have to make yourself. Having said that, you needn’t be so ashamed. If you want to ask for advice then by all means, just ask me directly,” Qing Shui said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Tiger was originally a normal human. At his age, normal people would have been married already, but his family was plagued by poverty so he had been unable to successfully court a lady. Luckily, the tides had turned in his favor and he would be able to choose a lady. Being single had caused a great deal of worry for Big Tiger’s mother. Marrying had its perks as forming a family and settling down would also allow him to lead a more stable life. Of course, he could also be a rich noble, a unique existence in Azure Rainbow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The girl I have in mind is the Third Young Lady of the Yu clan. We are in love but what worries me is that her family will not approve. Master, would it be at all possible for you to go there on my behalf and find out if they would cause problems for Man Tong and me?” Big Tiger asked amiably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised by the name that Big Tiger had said. He would never have imagined that the burly, brash Big Tiger would be able to win over the fancy of the Yu clan’s Third Young Lady. After all, the Yu clan was one of the three strongest clans. Even the Wang clan was far inferior. Though the reputation of the Imperial Cuisine Hall was great, the Yu Clan didn’t have much incentive to buy into the hype. At this present time, the Yu clan did not even regard Qing Shui that highly. However, there were certain matters that couldn’t be solved by force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it's too difficult, how about we just forget about it?” Big Tiger said in an uneasy voice, upon seeing Qing Shui’s reaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Tiger, in the end, was just a normal human and his mind worked the same way. In actual fact, Big Tiger did not have the guts to face the Yu clan due to his sense of inferiority. If not for the fact that she approached him on her own, Big Tiger would not dare to pursue a relationship with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You needn’t worry as this is not a difficult matter. So long as the two of you have willing hearts, I will help you to find out if the Yu clan will object to the two of you being together. Oh, by the way, tell me. How did you meet?” Qing Shui asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that Qing Shui was willing to assist him, Big Tiger was over the moon; in his eyes, his master was simply omnipotent. Big Tiger quickly described how the two of them met to Qing Shui: When the third daughter of the Yu family came to seek treatment, it was Big Tiger who gave her treatment. Her disease was complex and by no means easy to diagnose or cure. However, Big Tiger’s medicinal skills were not bad. In fact, they were good enough for him to gain the reputation as a Miraculous Physician in Azure Rainbow City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Tiger was simple-minded and his looks were nothing spectacular. However, he was very bulky and was adept in the field of medicine. On top of that, Qing Shui’s training had allowed him to become a Xiantian cultivator, something that made him stand out from the common folk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And with that, the third daughter of the Yu clan came to Big Tiger several times for treatment and she started to fall in love with this silly fellow. Big Tiger was often mistaken for being dumb, but he was just simple-minded. As the saying went, ‘Fortune favors fools’. Even when the daughter of the Yu family fell in love with Big Tiger, he did not acknowledge her as his lover for a long time and even when he did, his face turned a bright red and was very ashamed to confess his love for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The daughter of the Yu family was also very timid, but as a noblewoman, she was far more educated and she knew that Big Tiger was the type of guy who would not dare to confess to her if she didn’t take the first step. And so, she approached Big Tiger and asked sheepishly, “Tell me, do you like me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I like you, but you are too beautiful… I am not worthy of you,” Big Tiger replied, his face flushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was easy for a relationship to work out when the girl chases the guy; this was true in all cultures. And so it was, Big Tiger and the daughter from the Yu family affirmed their mutual affection between them. This scenario played out about a month ago, but he didn’t have the chance to tell Qing Shui when he returned previously, which was why he waited until now to inform him of this development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fret not. In the next two days, I’ll make a trip to the Yu family mansion,” Qing Shui gave Big Tiger a pat on his shoulder before returning to his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked upon the Nirvana Pill. As usual, it was still encased in ice. Qing Shui started to grin. This was the greatest benefit he got from the ruins of the Demon Lord Palace. He summoned the Dark Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui directly broke open the outer ice seal and threw it at the Dark Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nirvana Pill floated in front of the Dark Phoenix’s body and radiated an ominous cerulean glow before the gargantuan Black Phoenix opened its massive mouth and swallowed the Nirvana Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the skies of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui marveled at the overbearing black flames encasing the Dark Phoenix, the prelude to Nirvana. The flames around the Dark Phoenix’s body intensified, encapsulating the Dark Phoenix in larger streaks of coal-black flames. Slowly but surely, the Dark Phoenix reveled in the dark flames conjoined together with the flames to form a gigantic black ball as the surrounding flames continued their fiery dance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had no worries. This was a guaranteed Nirvana, compared to the Dark Phoenix’s natural ability that only had a 30% chance of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of the success rate, and the opportunity to comprehend the Ice Crystal Phoenix’s techniques, Qing Shui didn’t know what kind of combat abilities the Dark Phoenix would gain, nor could he guess the extent of its newfound power, or to what level its bloodline would ascend to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qing Shui was still dazed, the fiery ball exploded violently outwards and what emerged in front of Qing Shui’s eyes was, as usual, a Dark Phoenix as black as ink. This time, however, the Dark Phoenix emanated out a terrifying aura that was far, far stronger than before.</span></p>
