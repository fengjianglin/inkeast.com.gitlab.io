 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">(Author Note: The Heavenly Meridians is still at the eleventh one. It has been the same since the past. It might not necessarily be the talent of the women from the Portraits of Beauty, the Vampiric Empress didn’t help Qing Shui connect the meridians, she merely helped him strengthened his Goddess Force)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am back.” Qing Shui smiled and greeted Sheng Jun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s only after he had said it that he felt some ambiguity in his words. He was saying it like he was back in his own house. For some unknown reason, he felt that Sheng Jun was a very righteous woman. She also had a great personality, which led him to start treating her as his friend. Wherever a friend was, that place would be filled with warmth. The warmth caused him to say something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You seem to be quite energetic, I assume things have gone well for you?” Sheng Jun said in joy. While speaking, she slowly approached Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t really mean much with her words, yet Qing Shui still blushed upon hearing what she said. After all, before he left for the Vampiric Demoness Hills, he never would have thought that the Vampiric Empress would end up becoming his woman. He revealed an unnatural smile as he said, “She is now my woman.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was actually trying to tell her that the Vampiric Empress was now his woman. Since he treated Sheng Jun as his own friend, he hoped that in the future, if she ever interacted with her, they could consider his feelings and got along well with each other. After all, the Vampiric Demoness Hills was the closest area to the Sacred Mountain. Even though the Demon Slaughter Palace might be gone, but if more external forces were to come and intrude their land, they could at least work together to push them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do I look like I care.” Sheng Jun was speechless and shot a glare at Qing Shui. She then turned around and walked towards the palace hall not far away from here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his nose and giggled. What else could he say about things like that? He followed Sheng Jun along and walked towards the main hall. Usually, this was the place which Qing Shui would first go to whenever he arrived in Sacred Mountain. Every time he came, they would first settle down at the main hall. They would only start spending time at the courtyard after a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two had just been in the main hall for a short while when Qing Shui sensed an intense aura coming closer from the distance. At the same time, Sheng Jun’s expression also changed. He wasn’t really worried, or rather, he wasn’t particularly concerned about it. He then looked at Sheng Jun a bit puzzled. His mind told him that through her previous reaction, she should know what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My family is here.” Sheng Jun let out a sigh. She seemed a bit helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui has heard from before that the reason she came out, seemed to be in order to run away from her marriage. Everything became clear to him when he heard what she said. He then proceeded to ask her, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They have been here once a month ago, but I never promised to head back with them. I think they are here today to take me back home.” Sheng Jun revealed a helpless smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t you say before that your family treated you really well?” Qing Shui was a bit confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The one who comes today should be the family that I was arranged to get married to. Back then, my parents were greatly indebted to the clan. Hence, this marriage has been arranged at the moment when I was born.” Sheng Jun looked a bit bitter talking up to this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, there were many helpless things which a human was bound to face throughout his lifetime. There were many restrictions which could hold them back in their life, particularly for those who were responsible, righteous and who cared about their parents. They would be faced with even more restrictions in their life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also because of this reason, a majority of people looked forward to life without cares or worries. The devilish path pursued precisely that. They would do anything to achieve their goal, no matter what it’d cost. They were willing to do anything so long as their goals were accomplished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that your family isn’t aware that you aren’t willing to get married to him?” Qing Shui asked. Back in his previous incarnation, Qing Shui knew that since ancient times, even until the latest century, marriages were often held between families that were well-matched in social status. This applied even to families with an ordinary background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They know, but it is hard to go back on one’s word once a thing has been said, besides, my clan is also greatly indebted to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, could it be that you have finally managed to think things through and are going to get married to him?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you smiling? Do you enjoy seeing me in trouble that much?” It was rare to see Sheng Jun talking in a grumpy tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You won’t stand up against them, nor am I sure whether you have enough ability to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t do anything to them. In fact, I am also no match for them. They are from the Heaven Star Immortal Sect.” Sheng Jun said gently. She sounded a bit helpless and upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Sect once again, an immortal sect. This wasn’t unusual judging by how strong Sheng Jun was. Even she has said that she had no right to object them, the only sect capable of such things could only be an immortal sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful aura was getting closer and closer. Sheng Jun stood up and walked outside. Qing Shui also followed her outside to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far away in the distance, multiple flying beasts could be seen all over the sky. These flying beasts looked very huge and intimidating. They had the heads of mammoths. But compared to the mammoths, these beasts looked slightly more fierce and violent. They were also multiple times bigger than them. They had the body of an eagle accompanied by a huge pair of snow-white wing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Silver Elephant White Wing Eagle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also a kind of formidable mutated beasts. It’s not known whether they were pure or not. However, they looked very domineering and dignified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were roughly thirty people on top. There were men and women, the old and also the young. Very quickly, they were already above Qing Shui and Sheng Jun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Jun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when the formidable beasts stopped, a mature and elegant voice came through. Following on, a cheerful looking and handsome man jumped down. Very quickly, he was already standing in front of Qing Shui and Sheng Jun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. It’s unlikely that he was referring her as his sister through the way he addressed her. Besides, they didn’t look alike. Judging by the things which Sheng Jun told him from before, there was only one possibility. This was the man whom Sheng Jun was supposed to get married to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lian, why are you here?” Sheng Jun smiled and asked. It’s very obvious that she was asking intentionally despite knowing the answer. One month ago, the opposing party had sent their people over, only to be sent back by her. They were here now to rush the marriage as it was slowly approaching their wedding day. And this time, Lian Chengbiao decided to come personally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t we about to get married? I will be very troubled if you don’t turn up on the wedding day.” Lian Chengbiao said in joy. His cheerful look made people felt warm when looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Qing Shui must admit that this man was very affectionate and inspiring. The first impression he got from this man, was that he wasn’t a boring person. He cared about his external appearances. He wore noble clothes and left a comfortable impression to anyone who came across him. It matched him perfectly, in fact, it seemed like he was the only person capable of drawing out such effects with the clothes he was currently wearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lian, we are not meant for each other. I have always treated you like my own brother.” Sheng Jun said in a very calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun’s attitude, accompanied by her aura. Together, she gave people a noble feeling and the impression that she was a person of a higher social class. This was a kind of resistance, a kind of aura which only belonged to Fairy Sheng.</span></p>

He seemed to be a bit hesitant. But at the same time, his eyes were also filled with greed and stubbornness. This kind of greed was the equivalence of madness. Though it might not seem evil, it still contained a bit of such element. It was human nature to be greedy. Hence, Qing Shui felt he had no right to judge on whether it was evil. In fact, Qing Shui felt that he was even greedier if he was to compare himself with him.</span></p>

Our marriage has already been arranged for such a long time. I believe that we will develop feelings for each other as time passes. Feelings can be nurtured. Please believe in me, there is no one in this world who will love you more than me. No one can treat you better than I do.” Lian Chengbiao said in a very firm tone.</span></p>

Why did this man still insist on doing so even after hearing what Sheng Jun said? He might truly be in love with Sheng Jun, after all, there could rarely be any men who wouldn’t be attracted to her.</span></p>

A lot of people are already aware of the marriage that’s going to take place between you two.” A courteous middle-aged looking man came out and spoke.</span></p>

If he wasn’t mistaken, this should be Sheng Jun’s father.</span></p>
