 <p><strong>AST 1400 - Long Process Of Moving, Setting Up the Home in Dancing Phoenix Continent’s Capital, Grade Five Elements Divine Flag</strong></p>
 <p>Yuan Su stayed at Qing Clan for half a day before returning with him back to the Dancing Phoenix Continent. However, this time around, they passed by the Yehuang Country and thus he went to take a look at Soulsearch's place. There was also an Imperial Cuisine Hall here.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Boots had already increased by another grade. Right now, it took very little time for him to head from the Dancing Phoenix Continent's capital to the Yehuang Country. The Imperial Cuisine Hall was as prosperous as ever and there were no differences from before.</p>
 <p>Yao Qubing had already become a physician here but didn't enjoy the 10% profit. When he saw that Qing Shui and Yuan Su had came, Yao Qubing respectfully greeted Qing Shui and Yuan Su, "Sir, Miss, you've come! I'll go inform Physician Soulsearch."</p>
 <p>Yao Qubing sounded very surprised and he quickly ran upstairs.</p>
 <p>Yao Qubing's temperament had changed. Although he was a concubine's son in Yao Clan previously with no status, it didn't stop him from being arrogant. This was an arrogance that exuded from deep within him. It had no relations to his background but was from his medical skills.</p>
 <p>He felt that other than medical skills, he didn't have any other things. However, he hadn't expected to meet Qing Shui, Soulsearch and Yuan Su. Each of them were all better than him and it was a huge setback for him.</p>
 <p>From that moment onward, starting from the doing the odd chores at the Imperial Cuisine Hall, his life started to change and the air of arrogance on him disappeared</p>
 <p>Everyone had pride and arrogance in them but these weren't things to be brought out for display. In Qing Shui's previous life, he had heard of a saying that a person mustn't have an air of arrogance but must have pride deep from within.</p>
 <p>Take aristocrats for example. It took more than dressing up in good clothes and conducting oneself in a certain manner to make one an aristocrat. One's disposition was important. Even if one was so poor that he couldn't afford a meal, he was still an aristocrat. It was an air of dignity coming from them. It took more than three generations to nurture an aristocrat.</p>
 <p>The same went for the pride one felt from deep within!</p>
 <p>He had learned a lot of things from the Imperial Cuisine Hall and staying here was the best decision he had made in his life. Staying here would change his life forever.</p>
 <p>Now, he could stay in his position very calmly and felt very happy even if he was not given any payment. Another thing was that Yao Clan gradually didn't hold as high a status in his heart anymore.</p>
 <p>In the past, he wondered what he could get from Yao Clan and he also thought of the possibility of returning to Yao Clan. However, right now, he no longer cared for wealth and riches. Even if he didn't have any money now, he felt that he had no lack of money and didn't like money as much as he did in the past.</p>
 <p>This was a raise in one's realm with the improvement of one's strength. This was a raise of one's vision.</p>
 <p>"Brother has come? Come, let's go together!" Soulsearch happily said to Yao Qubing.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch treated him very well. To Yao Qubing, Soulsearch was his teacher.</p>
 <p>Teachers received great respect. Most importantly, Soulsearch had shared 20% of the 10% profit he was allocated with Yao Qubing.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch knew that it was impossible for Qing Shui to give Yao Qubing any more things for now. Although the Imperial Cuisine Hall here was his, Soulsearch would only take 10% of the profits. After all, they still needed Qing Shui's help to get rare spices and other things like that.</p>
 <p>He knew well that there wasn't a need to be so rigid between himself and Qing Shui. In his heart, everything here was given to him by Qing Shui. His medical skills wouldn't have reached such heights if he hadn't met Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Brother, I thought that you'd already forgotten about me. You haven't come for such a long time." When Soulsearch saw Qing Shui, he said happily, giving him a hug.</p>
 <p>"How could that be? Come, let's go up and have a chat."</p>
 <p>"We heard about the matters in the continent's capital as well," Soulsearch said happily.</p>
 <p>"Brother, there are many things to attend to in the continent's capital and I'll be running around in the future. Therefore, I still need your help to search for some powerful physicians or physicians with potential," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry about it. Mmm, right. Qubing can already be independent now," Soulsearch smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"The Imperial Cuisine Hall here belongs to you. The profits are all yours as well. Let Qubing stay here. You can also find some other physicians who aren't bad." Qing Shui gad also gotten quite a lot of benefits from here.</p>
 <p>"That won't do. I'll only take 10% of the profits. If I were to take all of them, you'd have to throw in a large amount of capital. Those things you bring can't be purchased with money," Soulsearch didn't even give it a second thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then we'll each take half. If you don't agree, then we can't be brothers anymore," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch wanted to say more but eventually only nodded helplessly.</p>
 <p>"Brother, we'll return to the continent's capital first." He handed an interspatial silk sachet to Soulsearch. There were all sorts of things inside.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yuan Su headed for the continent's capital with the Nine Continents Steps. He had given a sufficient amount of the profits to Soulsearch and would leave it to him to decide how much to give Yao Qubing. Soulsearch would definitely let Yao Qubing stay in the Imperial Cuisine Hall and if Yao Qubing wasn't a fool, he wouldn't leave either.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, after the Imperial Cuisine Hall in the continent's capital is open, are you planning to give the Imperial Cuisine Hall branch to the people you meet when you set a new one up in a different place?" As they rode on the Fire Bird to fly in the direction of the continent's capital, Yuan Su asked curiously.</p>
 <p>"In the past, I only thought that I would open an Imperial Cuisine Hall at the Yehuang Country but it's good like this as well for there to be more Imperial Cuisine Hall branches. It's a pity that powerful physicians are hard to find."</p>
 <p>Another reason that Qing Shui would take the Imperial Cuisine Hall in the continent's capital as the headquarters was because the continent's capital was very prosperous. There were also two powerful experts helping to guard the place.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he also had good relationships with those supreme aristocratic clans and powers. The Cloud Flutter Organization and Linghu Clan were definitely considered Qing Shui's friends. Even though the Linghu Clan belonged to the Phoenix Dance Organization, the latter wouldn't come to seek trouble. Otherwise, they wouldn't have gifted him with things.</p>
 <p>The more he dragged things out, the more things would be to his advantage. In the chat he had with the Phoenix Dance Organization previously, Qing Shui had made himself clear that he had no intention of making enemies, nor did he plan on unifying a continent. Therefore, there wasn't a need to view him as an enemy. He was just a passerby.</p>
 <p>After saying this, the people from Qing Clan would face less danger in the future. If others knew that Qing Shui would be bringing his family members here, they would all be willing to protect the safety of Qing Clan. This showed that Qing Shui was willing to lead a safe life here. Otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing his family. A person like Qing Shui was the best. No one would be able to do anything to him.</p>
 <p>"My family may be coming to the continent's capital after some time. The Imperial Cuisine Hall here will be Qing Clan's foundation. I'll have to rely on you for this. You'll be the only physician here. You should also keep a lookout to see if there are suitable people to help you." Qing Shui looked at Yuan Su and smiled.</p>
 <p>This made their relationship very clear, at least, Qing Shui's attitude. This place would be a foundation for Qing Clan and Yuan Su would be taking up an important position here.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I will. You're going to leave again?" Yuan Su said, a little depressed.</p>
 <p>"I have the Nine Continents Boots. It'll be very easy for me to come back."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>It was easy to bring someone back but he would need time. He could only bring one person each month. He would have to take a very long amount of time in total. Therefore, Qing Shui hoped to bring some of them over first.</p>
 <p>Time passed by and a large part of the year went by. During this period of time, nine people had came to the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Luan Luan, Yuchang, Qing You, Qing Bei, Qing Hu, Yu He, Hai Dongqing, Mu Qing, Chi Ao!</p>
 <p>The continent's capital was very lively now. Not only had Qing Shui guided them, the two old men also helped Qing Shui to guide them in their martial arts. This allowed them to progress at a tremendous rate.</p>
 <p>The medicinal pills and spiritual Qi here were very sufficient and Qing Shui was here all the time.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant still hadn't gone through a breakthrough. It was still just a little bit away. During this period of time, Qing Shui's strength had also risen by a lot. The Fire Bird's abilities had been stabilized and its strength had increased a lot as well. Its battle prowess was even more terrifying than before.</p>
 <p>Qing Luo and the others also started to accept this. Qing Shui told them that he wouldn't have to worry about them if they were to head over. He would be better able to move forward. They eventually agreed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui planned to let Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li and the other ladies come. However, it was harder for them to be 30 days apart from their young children. After so many months had passed, the children had grown up a lot. Wenren Wu-shuang's and Di Qing's children were still a little too young and thus the plan to bring them over could only be delayed.</p>
 <p>On this day, Yehuang Guwu told Qing Shui that her Five Elements Divine Flag could also bring one person with her. However, her location was set in the Soaring Dragon Continent. Therefore, this would have to be put aside for now. Qing Shui wasn't anxious either. He had a lot of time to take it slow.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, Yuan Su had found a physician. It was an old man who had retired for a very long time. He had not been able to treat his own condition and his internal organs had all shifted. He had been trying to heal himself but wasn't able to do so with success.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su healed his condition and it was only then that he agreed to join the Imperial Cuisine Hall. He had a strong understanding of medicinal herbs and pills. The old man's clan was also very powerful. It was the Shen Clan in the continent's capital.</p>
 <p>Shen Clan was a great clan in the continent's capital and they usually kept a low profile. However, people who were familiar with them would know that they were very strong. No one would usually offend clans which were powerful and kept a low profile. Shen Clan didn't participate in fights and didn't get close with other powers. They were just like ordinary people.</p>
 <p>Shen Clan had many different businesses but their main ones were dealings with medicinal herbs and pills.</p>
 <p>This old man had a high status in Shen Clan. Although he wasn't the clan's head, he wouldn't lose out much to the clan's head. After all, the old man was a brilliant existence in medicine.</p>
 <p>With this, Qing Clan and Shen Clan got a lot closer as well. Right now, the powerful forces in the continent's capital all knew of Qing Clan. It was a clan which kept as low a profile as Shen Clan but wasn't able to hide their glow.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui heard the Five Elements Divine Flag let out a crisp sound when he was tempering it. He agitatedly looked toward it and smiled. It had finally made it.</p>
 <p>Five Elements Divine Flags (Husband)!</p>
 <p>Grade five, can set three locations on the map. User can head to each position once each month.</p>
 <p>It was still at three locations. There were no changes.</p>
 <p>With the experience from the previous time, Qing Shui directly read on to the other abilities.</p>
 <p>Other than the teleportation ability between the husband and wife Five Elements Divine Flags, user could bring along two people with him. When bringing someone else along, one wasn't able to use the husband and wife teleportation function.</p>
 <p>He could now bring two people. Qing Shui smiled. He could now save a lot more time.</p>
 <p>Raising the grade of the Five Elements Divine Flag took about a year. It was still considered good. However, it wasn't considered a short amount of time. After all, Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Another thing was Yehuang Guwu. Her Five Elements Divine Flag couldn't upgrade so fast initially. However, due to the relationship between the husband and wife flag, their gaps couldn't be too big. Therefore, Qing Shui's progress was limited a little. Yehuang Guwu's Five Elements Divine Flag on the other hand progressed a lot faster.</p>
