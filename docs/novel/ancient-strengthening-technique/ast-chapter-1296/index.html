 <p><strong>AST 1296 - Happiness Of A Family Reunion, Yiye Jiange Wants To Leave, An Opportunity That Belongs To Her And The Seven-Headed Crystal Beast?</strong></p>
 <p>"Father!" Qing Yan said happily.</p>
 <p>Although she was an introvert, she was unlike Shi Qingzhuang. Because Shi Qingzhuang now had a daughter, she was a little different from how she was at the very beginning. She was more cheerful and was especially happy to be in a big clan like the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>"Yan`er, did you miss Father?" Qing Shui looked at his petite daughter who was like a little crystal princess and was unlike Qing Ming who would often get dust all over. Amongst all the kids, he was the most sorry-looking. No one knew what he did before he just came back.</p>
 <p>"I did, every day. I thought I'll only be able to see Father after I've grown up." Qing Yan wrapped her arms around Qing Shui's neck endearingly.</p>
 <p>"In the future, Father will come back once a month to visit. How is that?" When Qing Shui heard Qing Yan's words, he felt a little bad. He knew that parents had a good influence on their kids, and there was no other way out. Therefore, the help that the Five Elements Divine Flags brought to him was immense. Unknowingly, he felt especially thankful towards that lady.</p>
 <p>Putting aside being able to have a safety buoy, just in terms of being able to use this to spend time with his children and wives, Qing Shui already felt that it was a priceless and divine artifact. Some things don't wait for people, for example, children growing up. If he didn't see them while they grow up, even if he had all the means in the world, he wouldn't be able to turn back time. All that was left would just be regrets.</p>
 <p>"Really?" Qing Yan lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui with her eyes opened wide.</p>
 <p>"When has Father lied to you? Since I've said it, I'll definitely do it. Come, let's have a pinky promise."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and then reached out his finger.</p>
 <p>Qing Yan happily extended out her finger and hooked it with Qing Shui's. "Pinky promise, not allowed to change for 100 years!"</p>
 <p>"Alright, I'll never go back on my words. They're all witnesses, alright?" Qing Shui lowered his head to kiss Qing Yan's cheek. This was her daughter, the product of the love between him and the woman he loved. Hugging her gave him a strong feeling of connection of the blood. Hugging her felt like he was carrying the most precious crystal in the world.</p>
 <p>Qing Yan's happy and crisp laughter rang out very far away. It was a very influential laughter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put down Qing Yan and turned to take Qing Yu's hand. Qing Yu pouted so much that she would even be able to hang a small bottle on her lips. She appeared so aggrieved as if she was on the verge of crying.</p>
 <p>"Hmm? Who made our lass angry? Tell Father, I'll help you teach the person a lesson." Qing Shui felt especially happy. People said that the greatest happiness was a reunion with the family. It was an elevation of the spirit, the purest happiness. Even sex couldn't be compared.</p>
 <p>Standing here, he wouldn't feel lonely as being here was like his life's harbor. This was home, a place which produces love. Everyone here was selfless, being able to throw away their lives for each other willingly.</p>
 <p>After people had sex and gained enjoyment, if they were lonely, they would still return to their lonely state after the happiness. Sex without love was just a satisfaction of lust.</p>
 <p>"It's Father. You don't even take a look at Yu`er after coming back for so long." As she replied, the lass' tears fell down like a waterfall.</p>
 <p>Since young, Qing Yu had been the most domineering. Qing Zun, Qing Yin, and even Qing Ming would give in to her. Furthermore, she had always been headstrong. As long as Qing Shui was around, she would always have him to herself. When Qing Shui carried two children, one of them was always her. If he were to carry one, he could only carry her.</p>
 <p>Right now, after going one round, she still didn’t have her turn. Therefore, the lass was now angry.</p>
 <p>"Come, let's wipe away those tears. You're already a big girl now, how can you still be crying your eyes out? It's Father's fault to have angered our Yu`er. How do you want Father to make it up to you?" Qing Shui wiped away her tears and said as he smiled.</p>
 <p>"I want Father to spend more time with us this time around." Qing Yu's big intelligent eyes shimmered as she said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, since our Yu`er has spoken, I'll have to agree."</p>
 <p>Qing Yun had already seen Qing Shui earlier. Qing Long took Zhu Qing's hand and walked up to Qing Shui. Qing Shui squatted down. Qing Long was the youngest and looked dignified and strong, just like a tiger cub. He was especially cute.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui carried the little guy and got familiarized with him very quickly. It was only after that did he headed out to the hall with his family. Yiye Jiange, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Di Qing, Hai Dongqing... All of them were around, except Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan and Yuchang were around as well. Right now, Luan Luan was the strongest in the Qing Clan. Yiye Jiange and the other ladies had also gotten tremendously stronger and were all top notch existences, at least in the five continents.</p>
 <p>Although they were powerful in the five continents, they were still a far cry from the experts in the Western Oxhe Continent. Therefore, Qing Shui prepared some things which could raise their cultivation. He had been saving medicinal pills and other things for them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out puppets, snacks, and other stuff to distract them first. Qing Bei, Qing You, and the others were all around and the hall was extremely lively. Everyone had a share. Qing Shui had plenty of good things in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Looking at the many people in the Qing Clan, although Qing Shui didn't give up on them, it was hard to raise the cultivation level of all of them. It would require a lot of time, even if it was to only make them reach the Martial Saint level. Of course, the ladies on the Portraits of Beauty were an exception. Qing Shui had seen their achievements previously and the talent in their bodies had yet to awaken.</p>
 <p>Di Chen's potential had awakened, so did Yu Ruyan when she was on the Western Oxhe Continent and the same went for Tantai Xuan. The others at the Qing Clan had yet to awaken but it wouldn't be long before they do. It was because they were all now Martial Emperor level cultivators.</p>
 <p>The children had good foundations and were also very talented. Therefore, they were off to a good start. Qing Shui wasn't worried about the children's cultivation in the future. The ones he was most worried about, was his mother’s cultivation, Shi Qingzhuang, Huoyun Liu-Li, Yun Duan, and the others.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he would think all sorts of ways to help them push up their cultivation.</p>
 <p>He would also do the same to the rest of the people in the Qing Clan. Qing Zi's child, for example, would be much better. Although the child's talent wasn't that great, Qing Shui had helped him since young, and with his medical skills, it would be a lot easier.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, half a day had passed. Those who were supposed to cook went to cook and those who were supposed to take care of the children did so. Qing Shui stood up and walked over to Qing Yi.</p>
 <p>"Mother, I don't have news of him yet, but I'll soon be able to go look for him." Qing Shui at the sat opposite of Qing Yi and said.</p>
 <p>"There's no hurry. What matters the most is your safety. We've lived for so many years without him. Right now, you're indispensable to the Qing Clan, therefore, nothing else is important. All that matters is for you to be well. Only with this would then there be other possibilities." Qing Yi said seriously to Qing Shui. There was happiness in her smile. This was her son.</p>
 <p>"Mother, don't worry. Right now, there aren't many who can hurt your son. But father should be somewhere else which I can't head to for now." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"There's no hurry. So many years have passed. Qing Shui, you can make the decision for yourself. You must think of the entire Qing Clan. You have heavy responsibilities on your shoulder and we can't do anything to help you." Qing Yi sighed and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"I only hope that Mother and the entire Qing Clan is well. With these, I'll have endless energy." Qing Shui said happily.</p>
 <p>"Is it true that you'll be able to return for a few days every month in the future?" Qing Yi clearly didn't believe this either.</p>
 <p>"I have a treasure which can let me travel between the two regions once a month. Therefore, I can come back once a month." Qing Shui wouldn't hide this from his family.</p>
 <p>"This is for the best. You'll be able to spend more time with Mingyue and the others. It hadn't been easy for them. You should stay for a few more days this time around!" Qing Yi was very happy to know that Qing Shui was able to come back once a month. Or rather, she was happier than anyone else.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Master!"</p>
 <p>"Since you're back, you should spend more time with them!" Yiye Jiange's beautiful brows frowned as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"I missed you!" Qing Shui knew that calling her Master made her felt bad and he held up her hand.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange's beauty was one of transcendence, without a hint of an aura of the mortal world. Before her, Qing Shui always felt a little bit inferiority. This feeling of inferiority wasn't related to power as this lady was one which would make one feel that she shouldn't be tainted.</p>
 <p>In fact, his relationship with Yiye Jiange had been set into stone. It was just that they didn't have any overly intimate contact.</p>
 <p>"Are you here to infuriate me?" Yiye Jiange let Qing Shui take her hand as she said angrily. Right now, she gave more feeling of being a reliant and delicate lady. Her transcendent aura was a little faint compared to before, but it was still powerful overall. This was especially when they hadn't met for such a long time, which made it hard for Qing Shui to take action.</p>
 <p>"How could I dare?" Qing Shui took her hand and walked around the Qing Clan. The Qing Clan was quite big and they could have a walk around.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, since you can come back once a month, I might be leaving for some time." Yiye Jiange hesitated for a while and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Could it be that all ladies on the Portraits of Beauty would bring so much trouble? However, he still said calmly: "What's wrong? Is it because you don't like it here?"</p>
 <p>"That's not it. Qing Shui, don't think too much into it. The Seven-Headed Crystal Beast told me that it wanted to bring me to a place to cultivate and it would be able to inherit the legacy of the Crystal Beasts, allowing it to truly become an Ancient Spiritual Crystal Beast, or even stronger. It had brought this up many times, but I can't leave since you're not around. Since you can now come back once a month, and the Qing Clan is quite powerful now, I'd like to go take a look with it." Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Oh, this is good news. I'll bring you there in a few days. At the very least, I must bring you to that place. I'll be assured that way." Qing Shui was wondering what was wrong, but this was a good news.</p>
 <p>The Seven-Headed Crystal Beast was tamed by Yiye Jiange after it had evolved from the Six-Headed Crystal Beast. It would only recognize a person it viewed as pure as its owner, and it must be a very pure person.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could still clearly recall the scene when Yiye Jiange had tamed the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast.</p>
 <p>"You can't go there. It said that it has a unique ability which can only be used once and that can bring us to the place. Only after it received the true legacy of the Crystal Beasts would it then become a true Crystal Beast." Yiye Jiange shook her head and said.</p>
 <p>"So that's it!" Qing Shui frowned. He was afraid that Yiye Jiange might be in danger.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, there's no danger." Yiye Jiange smiled and gently pat Qing Shui's forehead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took her two beautiful hands. He was wondering how he could give her some assurance for her safety.</p>
 <p>"The Crystal Beast said that it's a place where it can receive the legacy, and there won't be any danger. Moreover, I'll get huge benefits and will get a great improvement in my abilities." Yiye Jiange said once again.</p>
 <p>"I'm still worried." Qing Shui gave it a lot of thought before he said.</p>
 <p>"It's a secluded crystal palace and it'll bring me there directly. It's an ancient ruin. Don't worry, the Crystal Beast now has a few more abilities and there's no issue for me to ensure my life. Moreover, only me and the Crystal Beast would be able to enter because of the imprint which has been awakened on its body. Therefore, there won't be any danger."</p>
 <p>"Alright, but you must still be careful." Qing Shui knew that Yiye Jiange really wanted to go. In the end, he agreed, primarily because he knew that the awakened imprint was of no danger. This was one reason why he had agreed. If it was like some other ancient ruins, he would definitely go with her. This imprint was like heading to a treasure chamber, and thus it was something to be happy about.</p>
