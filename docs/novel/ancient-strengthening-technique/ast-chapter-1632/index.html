 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire group returned to the living room and Qing Shui took Yin Tian’s pulse. He discovered that Yin Tian’s body was recovering much better than expected and he was much better than when he previously left him. Yin Tian’s strength had increased several times too, but his strength right now still paled in comparison to his heyday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How’s it?” Yin Tian smiled at Qing Shui. He asked only because he was certain that he was much better than before. He wouldn’t have asked if he wasn’t recovering because Qing Shui might not be honest then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very good, much better than what I expected; Uncle’s body has a strong self-healing ability, too. I’ll make some adjustments for your recuperation, but you must be mentally prepared, as I estimate about 1.5 years before you fully recover. However, I can’t be certain of that.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve waited for so many years already. Moreover, I don’t feel any discomfort in my body so 1.5 years is something I can wait for. Meeting you, I’m not fated to die this time after all.” Yin Tian politely said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle, you don’t have to be so polite. We got along very well previously and I also felt that we were fated to meet. My wife is now your goddaughter, so if you were to further stand on ceremony, then you’re treating me as an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not mean that Tantai Lingyan was their goddaughter, but rather his wife. Yin Tian and Feng Xi were sharp enough to decipher what it meant and Yin Tian smiled: “It is your fortune for a good girl like Lingyan to become your wife. You must not bully her. Otherwise, I won’t let you off regardless of whether you’re my benefactor. We don’t have a daughter so this goddaughter is as good as our own blood daughter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui chuckled: “Rest assured Uncle, I can’t wait to dote on her, so how can I bear to bully her? Lingyan will also treat me as well as Aunt Feng treats you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan knew Qing Shui said it intentionally, but it was heartfelt. Upon hearing the last sentence, Tantai Lingyan wondered that ,if the same thing were to happen to Qing Shui, would she take care of him and look for doctors, like how Godmother did for Yin Tian?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Godmother was fortunate. Perhaps it was her persistence that touched the heavens and led to this day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody ate together. Lan Lingfeng, Yin Tong and the rest left first. Only Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan remained, as well as Yin Tian and Feng Xi. On a certain level, they were just like a family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi chatted briefly about Tantai Lingyan’s matters. This way, if the latter wanted to reveal more she would do so naturally, but if she did not want to say further, she would naturally stop probing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During their conversation, Feng Xi and Tantai Lingyan spoke a lot about the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. They had a son but no daughter. Such a circumstance was uncommon. After all, for a sect as strong as the Divine Moon Immortal Sect, if something were to happen to their sole offspring, it would be the end for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this child was outstanding, Qing Shui was giving acupuncture to Yin Tian on the sidelines, going through another round of Constitution Nurturing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he prescribed some medicine and some herbal cuisine. These herbal cuisines were not your average sort - the Imperial Cuisine Hall did not sell these herbal cuisines. It was specially prepared for warriors healing their injuries, as complementing it with medicine could result in double the effect with half the effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden Fragrance Jade!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tian’s injuries were too serious and while the Golden Fragrance Jade was unable to provide that much help, its efficacy was still good. The Small Revitalizing Pellet and Great Revitalizing Pellet provided a much better result in treating such injuries. The Bone Strengthening Pill, Constitution Nurturing Pill and Origin Returning Pill were great for recuperation due to the excellent effects, but these medicines had to be properly administered - the time when they were taken was vital. Even medicine that’s beneficial to the body could not be carelessly taken - mixing two non-poisonous medicines together could result in an acute poison or possibly neutralize each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, half a day had gone by. The Constitution Nurturing this time had a significantly better effect than the first and now that Yin Tian’s body had entered a high speed recovery stage, Qing Shui was confident of aiding his full recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, what plans do you and Lingyan have? Anything important to settle here?” Feng Xi said after thinking for a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui heard the saying that he had already known the idea of the wind. He did not have any important things right now. Things were already on the right track, and the Sea King’s Palace was doing well. However, there was also the Sunset Palace which Qing Shui had some hesitation towards. They’d begin to work against the Sea King’s Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui laughed: “Does Aunt Feng have anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I only returned to the Divine Moon Immortal Sect once in the ten years that I was out and about, and now that Yin Tian’s body is much better and out of a coma, I would like to return with him to take a look.” Feng Xi laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui: “Aunt Feng, the wind is ready to let us go together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to let Yin Tian remain here, but Feng Xi would surely not be at ease. However Qing Shui was also not very assured about this place and he thought about another solution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have anything that you’re concerned about? How about letting Aunt Fent help you find a solution.” Feng Xi could tell that there was something on Qing Shui’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought for a while and said: “It’s better to let me settle it myself. Give me a couple of days, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course that’s fine. Anyways, we’re not in a hurry, we only thought of going home to take a look and stay for a few days.” Feng Xi instantly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Qing Shui felt relaxed and smiled: “I’ve just given some treatment to Uncle and he doesn’t need treatment for the next half a month. Uncle can cultivate for half a day everyday, but should not overexert himself. Here’s a set of fist techniques that Uncle can use to train for a bit every day. This regimen is great for the body’s recovery.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Qing Shui taught Yin Tian was the Taichi Fist - this technique was good for one’s temperament and cultivation. Tantai Lingyan was also learning it right now. After all she’s the Demon King’s Inheritor and no matter whether the matter concerning the Demon Lord’s Blood was true or not, Qing Shui wanted her to pick up tje Taichi Fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was very talented and her progression in Taichi Fist was really fast. Perhaps because she did not have many burdens, she was able to reach a state of emptiness - this state of mind was very mysterious, not akin to desolation. Coupled with her natural talent, she somehow made it into the great hall of Taichi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This talent was similar to the one displayed by Yehuang Guwu in Tiger Form, reaching the large success stage in a month’s time. Such a speed of progression was truly terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little needed to be said about Yin Tian’s talent. Qing Shui only demonstrated once and talked about the key points and Yin Tian said in surprise: “This fist technique is really not bad. It’s a gentle and kind fist technique that’s also very bright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can I also train for a bit?” Feng Xi smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, I’m only afraid Aunt Feng doesn’t think much of it.” Qing Shui hurriedly added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your uncle has already said that this fist technique is good. It’s more like you’re not willing.” Feng Xi was in a good mood. The depression of these couple of years had also sent her over the edge, but now she could finally take a breath.</span></p>

Everyone was together, but Qin Qing had temporarily went back two days ago while adding that she would be back soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Tantai, you’re really beautiful, as beautiful as Sister Qing.” Xue Nuo smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a little gloomy. He had the feeling that Xue Nuo was the kind who liked to get up to some mischief but played the innocent one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I?” Tantai Lingyan said as a smile appeared across her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Nuo was the first to call Feng Xi Aunt Feng, but upon realizing Tantai Lingyan had become Feng Xi’s goddaughter, she felt as if Tantai Lingyan had stolen a treasure of hers. While that feeling wasn’t strong, she just felt uncomfortable. But since Tantai Lingyan was Qing Shui’s wife, she had to be respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right, my brother-in-law is really fortunate. My big sister is also a beauty like all of you.” Xue Nuo happily, albeit naively, said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his temples while Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong smiled at him. Even Ziche Sha and Ling Fei looked at Qing Shui and the rest in amusement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t your big sister called Jiange?” Tantai Lingyan said with a calm look on her face.</span></p>

Only she saw that the conflict within Xue Nuo had something to do with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good little lass, was it because Aunt Feng recognized Lingyan as goddaughter that you don’t feel too good? You are my younger sister, a precious younger sister.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who says so? Am I that petty?” Xue Nuo looked a little unnatural. It was unclear if it was because of what was said before or just now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui truly treated the bright and limpid girl as his own kin sister, except Xue Nuo might not think the same of Qing Shui. Despite calling him brother-in-law, what was truly in her heart was really unclear. At that time, he brought her away based on the fact that he was marrying into her family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Nuo was very beautiful and there wasn’t even much of a difference when compared to Ziche Sha. Among the women by Qing Shui’s side, Xue Nuo looked the youngest and was also the most vivacious, just like the next door neighbor’s little sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui liked the older sister and not so much the younger sister. That time in Hundred Miles City, he had rejected the little lass Xiang Bao. Xue Nuo was much more mature than she was, but even then, she was still the little sister in Qing Shui’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, Qing Shui did not let Tantai Lingyan accompany him and he went to Ice Ocean Domain on his own before rushing in the direction of Sunset Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to meet with the Sunset Palace’s mistress and he wanted to know the intentions of Sunset Palace. Otherwise, this time it would be difficult for him to leave without feeling reassured.</span></p>

When they reached the Sunset Palace’s sphere of influence they discovered that the Water Domain was definitely stronger than the Sea King Palace. They shouldn’t be on the same level, since spiritual qi was abundant in the water here.</span></p>

Why have you barged into our Sunset Palace Water Domain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was his first time seeing a Kappa, who looked like a little similar to the Turtle Prime Minister* of fairy tales in his previous life. There was a turtle shell on his back, but the shell was neither bloated nor cumbersome. It looked more like a turtle shell-patterned battle armor. Kappas were also a strong species within the Water Domain. As long as you consider underwater power, one would find the presence of them regardless of strength. Legend had it that some of these Kappa had cultivated past the level of False God.</span></p>
