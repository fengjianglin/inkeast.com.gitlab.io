 <p><strong>AST 1317 - Imperial Cuisine Hall, Life and Death Needles, Physician's Divine Artifact</strong></p>
 <p>It was because medicinal pills weren't omnipotent and the more medicinal pills one used, the greater the resistance their body would develop toward medicine. Physicians could reduce the medicinal resistance built up, especially powerful physicians!</p>
 <p>This was also why powerful physicians were turning toward physicians who could battle.</p>
 <p>Ordinary physicians weren't comparable to alchemists. After all, alchemists' mastery of acupuncture was high. Of course, they could also heal medical conditions and it would be at a great speed. At the initial phase, physicians were more pitiful and could only treat medical conditions using medicinal herbs. In comparison, physicians were slower and the duration of the treatment would be longer as well.</p>
 <p>When physicians grew stronger, they would be able to use acupuncture as well as other unique methods to help cultivators better absorb medicinal pills and reduce their level of medicinal resistance. They could even use their abilities to extend one's lifespan. Of course, there were very few physicians who could reach this stage.</p>
 <p>The old physician by the name of Soulsearch had reached this level of mastery. If Qing Shui's guess wasn't wrong, the reason this elderly man could live for 100 years more should be because of this old physician.</p>
 <p>The black liquid continued to drip out and a small bowl was used to hold it. It stopped only after over ten drips. Qing Shui slowly drew out the needles and someone immediately brought out the small bowl which was used to contain the pungent liquid.</p>
 <p>After the windows were opened, fresh air quickly filled the room, dissipating the pungent smell from earlier. Old Master Li moved his body and realized that his body seemed to be much more at ease than before. He was filled with a powerful vitality that seemed to be slowing increasing.</p>
 <p>He looked toward Qing Shui in astonishment and spoke after a very long while, "Physician, you're really a miraculous physician. Earlier, I made the wrong judgment. Both you and Soulsearch are miraculous physicians. I'm really honored."</p>
 <p>"Old Master Li, I'm in no way comparable to Sir." Soulsearch smiled bitterly, shaking his head. However, he quickly looked at Qing Shui with a fervent gaze.</p>
 <p>"Old Master, if I'm not wrong, the reason Old Master Li could live 100 years longer must be thanks to you, right? Right now, I've only extended Old Master Li's lifespan by another 100 years. Therefore, you're being too polite," Qing Shui said politely.</p>
 <p>"Sir, you should talk more with Soulsearch. His Imperial Cuisine Hall is well-known even across the entire Yehuang Country. It was his medicinal food which allowed this old set of bones to live for another 100 years. Right now, meeting sir has allowed me to live another 100 years. I'm really honored. Heaven has really treated me well." Old Master Li was clearly very happy.</p>
 <p>The young man called Ye`er now had his head lowered as he stood behind Soulsearch. However, he threw occasional gazes toward Qing Shui, filled with hatred. Qing Shui's spiritual sense was very powerful and could of course sense it. However, he did not think much of it.</p>
 <p>"Tayuan, bring out that set of needles." Old Master LI said to an old man next to him.</p>
 <p>"Yes, Father!" The old man left.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch's eyes lit up as he looked toward Old Master Li. Then, he broke into a faint smile.</p>
 <p>"Thank you!" The lady called Yan`er walked up to Qing Shui and thanked him seriously.</p>
 <p>She wasn't very tall but she had a well-proportioned figure. Her pair of big eyes seemed a little charming and her lips were very sexy The curve at her chest was well-embodied as well.</p>
 <p>She was very beautiful but was still a very far cry from Canghai Mingyue's level. However, Qing Shui still felt a little agitated. It was because she looked too much like the girl he had liked in his previous life, both her voice and appearance.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that Qing Shui knew that they were two different people and only looked alike. This was also one reason he had agreed to treat the old man earlier.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to stand on ceremony." Qing Shui looked at her face. Time had passed and the agitation he had felt in the past was now replaced with calmness. However, he still had an extremely familiar feeling. It was a feeling, a feeling from his previous life.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the earlier old man entered while holding a rustic wooden box.</p>
 <p>The old man handed the wooden box to Old Master Li.</p>
 <p>The old man slowly opened the box. Milky white gleams of light with an indescribable glow was exuded. Even Qing Shui was taken aback by the powerful spiritual intelligence it exuded.</p>
 <p>Life and Death Needles</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the nine nine-inch needles which were half milky white, half pale green in color. There were a total of nine brilliant glows on them.</p>
 <p>Old Master Li held onto the Life and Death Needles. He had once given them to Soulsearch. However, after Soulsearch had caused the deaths of numerous people with these needles, he returned them to Old Master Li. Soulsearch didn't say anything back then. These were good needles but it was a pity that he couldn't use them.</p>
 <p>"Sir, these needles are said to be called the Life and Death Needles. Soulsearch had used them before but he returned them to me. Please take a look to see if you would be able to use them. These needles are very dangerous. They are as their name suggests, a fine line between life and death." Old Master Li looked at Qing Shui in anticipation and then handed the Life and Death Needles to him.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, Qing Shui had already assessed them with his Heavenly Vision Technique. He was agitated, too agitated. It was as if these needles were specially made for him. The Life and Death Needles were half heaven and half hell and if used well, their effect would even be several times or several tens of times better than the Gold Needles.</p>
 <p>However, the upper portion of the Life and Death Needles which were a light green in color were the Death Needles. The lower portion where the needles' tips were at were the Life Needles. They could also be called the Yin Needles and Yang Needles.</p>
 <p>Such needles could be used on both ends but to use these needles, one would need a power which could awaken powerful vitality or a force which could strengthen vitality. Therefore, when Qing Shui saw these Life and Death Needles, the first thing he thought of was the Force of Rebirth.</p>
 <p>His Force of Rebirth!</p>
 <p>"Old Master, this is too valuable. I can't accept it." What Qing Shui said was the truth. These needles could be said to be divine artifacts for physicians. Of course, that was if the physician could use it.</p>
 <p>"These needles have been with me for several hundred years but it’s a pity that no one has been able to use them. A treasured sword should be gifted to a hero. Since you're able to use these, I'll be very happy to gift them to you. Moreover, you have saved me. Just take this as my thanks!" Old Master Li was at ease with this. He knew that the needles were good stuff but keeping them with him would be just like casting pearls before swine and he won't be able to reveal their true value.</p>
 <p>"Keep it. If you were to use these needles, the effects of your treatment will be able to increase by several times over. It'll be like adding wings to a tiger, doubling its might," Soulsearch also said happily.</p>
 <p>"Then I shan't stand on ceremony."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said politely and then reached out his hands to receive the Life and Death Needles. Although he didn't try them, he knew that he could use them. Therefore, he was about to put them away.</p>
 <p>"Who knows if you can use them. Why don't you try it out right now?" Just then, an exceptionally irritable voice rang out, causing many people to frown.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this young man must be definitely backed by a powerful clan. Otherwise, he wouldn't dare to be so arrogant. Moreover, Soulsearch didn't seem to really like this young man but yet still kept him by his side. There must be some other reason for this.</p>
 <p>"Alright. Do you dare to let me try it out on you?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at him.</p>
 <p>"I don't want to be killed." The young man's acrid voice rang out.</p>
 <p>"I'll give it a try!"</p>
 <p>At that moment, the lady called Yan`er spoke up.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then we'll let Miss Yan`er try it out!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's words shut the few people who wanted to talk up.</p>
 <p>"Yan`er, you'll have to think over this carefully. You're still so young. If any problem were to occur, you would lose your life."</p>
 <p>When the young man said this, Soulsearch's lips twitched a little. He had a trauma from these needles. When the young man said this, it was as if he had gotten a slap in the face.</p>
 <p>"I believe in him!" Li Yan wasn't afraid in the least. She spoke softly but firmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui picked up a Life and Death Needle, held it in the middle and then twisted it to spin it very quickly. He channeled in his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>Closing his eyes, Qing Shui sensed the energy coming from the tip of the needles. He didn't feel any harm in it and thus circulated it around. He wanted to observe it for a little longer.</p>
 <p>After about less than 7.5 minutes, the light green portion started to exude a death Qi in the direction of the silvery white portion. As it passed through one of the seven-colored spots, it would grow a bit stronger and by the time it reached the needle's tip, it had already became very powerful.</p>
 <p>This kind of death Qi was useful as well. It could force some of the death Qi in the body to a certain area and could also absorb poison. It was like how poison could be used to tackle poison. Sometimes, poison could be used for more than just inflicting harm.</p>
 <p>After a while, Qing Shui used his own powers in a bid to attempt to stop the death Qi and then he let the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique circulate down. He managed to do so with ease.</p>
 <p>Next, Qing Shui then circulated his Force of Rebirth. Wherever it passed by, the nine seven-colored light spots on the Life and Death Needles suddenly shot out with a brilliant glow. Qing Shui's eyes lit up. What a powerful spiritual Qi!</p>
 <p>By this time, even Soulsearch was stunned.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened his eyes and saw that Li Yan was just right before him. He then directly pierced the needle into her Central Palace!</p>
 <p>Next, he quickly picked up another two Life and Death Needles and a surging powerful flash to and fro on the needles multiple times before the needles were then inserted at the Yunmen and Tianfu acupuncture points.</p>
 <p>Seven needles!</p>
 <p>He inserted the needles in the shape of the Big Dipper, all the way down to her abdomen. His finger lightly flicked the needles and an extremely clear buzzing sound rang out.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>A faint glow was exuded from Li Yan's body and a powerful aura scattered out.</p>
 <p>She had attained a breakthrough!</p>
 <p>Although Li Yan wasn't the strongest amongst the younger generation, she was also a Peak Grade One State Master. However, she had now attained a breakthrough and it was a powerful one. Her powers were increased by close to 50%.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised as well. It was because as he helped her to nurture her constitution, he was also helping to build up her foundations. He hadn't expected that the moment he was done with the building up of her foundation, she would attain a breakthrough immediately. In the future, her cultivation would be increasing rapidly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had underestimated the prowess of the Life and Death Needles. This was the first time he was using them and he hadn't even used 10% of their prowess. However, it was already much better than the effects of the gold needles.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui removed the needles and Li Yan opened her eyes and looked at Qing Shui in surprise with her beautiful eyes. It was because she had been stuck at Peak Grade One State Master for a very long time and hadn't expected to attain a breakthrough this time around. Moreover, she had almost reached the level of a Peak Grade Two State Master. She wasn't aware that when compared to this, her greatest benefit from this was that Qing Shui had nurtured her constitution and strengthened her foundations.</p>
 <p>"Sir, you're a miraculous physician. Are you accepting disciples?" Soulsearch asked carefully.</p>
 <p>"You have a junior who wishes to pick up medical skills?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
 <p>"No, it's me. My only hobby is medical skills. Can you accept me as your disciple?"</p>
 <p>Soulsearch's words stunned everyone, even Qing Shui and the young man called Ye`er. Qing Shui was astonished by what the old man said but Ye`er was full of regret. His abilities were about the same as Li Yan but with this, her abilities had surpassed his by more than twice.</p>
