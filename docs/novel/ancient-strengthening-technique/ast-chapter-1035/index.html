 <p><strong>AST 1035 - Incident Over, Fourth Wave Great Golden Buddha Palm</strong></p>
 <p>The Great Golden Buddha Palm that was cast using spirit energy could be classified as a spirit technique. With the Arhat Rosary Beads, Qing Shui can ignore the rules of heaven and earth when using spirit energy.</p>
 <p>Already at two Golden Palm prints, Qing Shui was satisfied with his progress. In regards to the Buddha Aura Great Illumination Formation, Qing Shui had already looked over it during his rest period. There wasn’t anything special about it, with his foundation in formations he could easily understand its makeup. All that was left was to find time to experiment later.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he had the Five-colored Rod. Qing Shui planned to leave some time to smelt it onto the Big Dipper Sword. He already had this idea when he had first gotten it, since he had no intentions of using the rod as a weapon, thus he decided to smelt it into the Big Dipper Sword. Hopefully, this would increase his strength in spirit energy.</p>
 <p>It was already midnight by the time he came out, however Qing Shui had to make his way to Huoyun Liu-Li’s room. It would have been better if he had no women around, otherwise he would not be able to hold it. When he traveled before, there was a time spanning months to half a year where he would not touch any woman. He had been busy and under quite a bit of pressure, but in between there would still be several women that he would meet up with. Of course, he was happy because he truly loved them.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui arrived in Liu Li’s room, he noticed that she was not sleeping yet, but their daughter was sound asleep. Afterwards, Qing Shui carried Huoyun Liu-li to the living room and lingered there for a long time. Now that the matter that had been gnawing at her heart had been solved, Huoyun Liu-Li was more relaxed. She and Qing Shui boldly lingered…</p>
 <p>The next day Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-LI left. Leaving at the same time were Huoyun Peng and Mo Hongluo. The old man did not keep them since they already experienced much hardship.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui discovered that there was a different air about the two of them. They seemed to have become younger. Moreover, he could feel Mo Hongluo’s Qi movement. She will have a breakthrough soon.</p>
 <p>Now that the blockade in her heart had been resolved, the bottleneck will be broken through eventually.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng’s strength improved by quite a bit, but he was bounded by the rules of Heaven and Earth. His body also experienced a wonderful change, but he may not have realized it yet, he had a spiritual breakthrough.</p>
 <p>At last a reunion, the matter here should be put aside.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and crew went towards Fair Wind City. They planned to stay there for some time. No matter what, Central Continent was their home.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng and Mo Hongluo’s appearance made members of the Qing Clan happy. Qing Shui wanted to introduce Huoyun Peng to his mother and uncles.</p>
 <p>Now that everything was settled, it would be best to celebrate with a banquet. Especially since the return of Little Fattie, this was the best result that they could have asked for.</p>
 <p>The Qing Clan made themselves at home in Fair Wind City. However, they did not invite Huoyun Peng and Mo Hongluo to settle here with them since they seem to have a bad impression of Central Continent.</p>
 <p>They only stayed in the Qing Clan home for two days. Had they not hated to part with Liu-Li they probably would not have even stayed. Finally, the two of them left for Greencloud Continent’s Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p>“Honey, if you have free time come with Qing Shui and your baby girl to visit us in Hundred Miles City. We have decided to settle there.”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-li was reluctant, but nodded her head. This was alright, if there was time in the future they could stay over for one or two months.</p>
 <p>Waving goodbye with Qing Shui, Huoyun Peng and Mo Hongluo parted. They both had mounts. On top of that, Huoyun Peng’s strength could intimidate any party, therefore their safety should not be an issue.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had also informed Huoyun Peng several things about the General Manor, Hundred Miles City, and Heavenly Palace. Huoyun Peng could easily see through Qing Shui’s intention.</p>
 <p>……………………………………………………….</p>
 <p>The Qianyu Clan and Nian Clan were situated near the eastern borders of Central Continent, while Qing Shui was situated to the west of the center. It could not be called close in terms of distance for gathering together.</p>
 <p>Qingyu Clan probably does not know Qing Shui was in Central Continent. Qing Shui shook his head after thinking for a bit. Being far apart in distance, plus they were not on the same level, thus they might not be aware of the incident with the Buddha Sect.</p>
 <p>Three days passed by, Qing Shui and members of the Qing Clan stayed indoors. Since it was a rare opportunity for some peace, members of the Qing Clan entered a nerve-wrecking cultivation state.</p>
 <p>In the Qing Clan, there were already several Martial Emperors such as Yiye Jiange, Canghai Mingyue, Di Qing, Mingyue Gelou, Luan Luan and himself. Di Chen who had left was also Martial Emperor level.</p>
 <p>They had rapid progress because they were all people innately talented and with formidable constitutions. The Qing Clan’s original members were progressing quickly, which was faster than before, but Qing Shui was still not satisfied. However, there was no other way, food had to be eaten a bite at a time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Mingyue Gelou. This pure, dignified and composed woman went from someone who knew nothing about cultivations to her current level. Qing Shui felt she was the one with the greatest achievement.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grasped her hand while browsing at the fish swimming in the pond. Qing Ming was cultivating. Out of all his women, she was the quietest. Her demeanor always showing satisfaction. She always smiled when looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou was passionately in love with the man that had changed her life forever.</p>
 <p>Holding her hand, looking at her satisfied smile, the bindi between her eyebrows, and her dignified composure, Qing Shui could not help but be entranced by her temperament every time.</p>
 <p>“Look at the fish that are coupled together, spending everyday together. They look happy, if we could be like this it would be nice.”</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou was older than Qing Shui, there were not many changes compared how she was when Qing Shui first met her. The only difference was her temperament being even better than before, her slender body became more full-bodied, in a way it looked mature and alluring.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do you not feel happy being together with everyone? You’re a man with many things on your shoulder. If it was not for your sacrifice, we would not have the happiness we have now.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Time passed so quickly, Yuchang had only been two years old back then, now she was already twenty something.” He did not know why he had said this, but the more he thought about it, the deeper the feelings of reminisce got that he could not express in words.</p>
 <p>“Right, did I get old?” Mingyue Gelou seemed to have thought of something and laughed.</p>
 <p>“Not at all, you are more womanly than before.” Qing Shui embraced her full-bodied waist, his eyes staring at her breasts.</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>MIngyue Gelou became more cheerful compared to before since she and Qing Shui had been married for so long. She had been a very shy woman before, but asking that question now the bindi between her brows were just as bright.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui answered her by directly kissing her tender and sexy lips.</p>
 <p>“Ah, Qing Shui, not here…”</p>
 <p>…………………………………….</p>
 <p>These last few days, Qing Shui and members of the Qing Clan had spent their time to the fullest. Since they were not lacking in money, they spent all their time on cultivation. The Qing Clan had opened a shop in Fair Wind City. The shop was run by Qing Shui’s uncle and aunt. Their strength had been raised by Xiantian Golden Pellet, thus they currently could not make a breakthrough. Though, there might be a method to allow them to breakthrough in the future.</p>
 <p>Besides, Qing Shui had a free pass to go anywhere. Those that were in the commercial industry wanted to affiliate themselves with the Qing Clan. Since this was something that could be used to their benefit, they would take these relationships when they needed to.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Beast Transformation Armor increased by a little over a meter, but it was in its infancy. Although he felt that the infancy period was just about to pass, Qing Shui was in full anticipation. On the other hand, the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm had the greatest progress.</p>
 <p>Fourth Wave!</p>
 <p>This left Qing Shui excited. Its power was stronger than the elder’s fifth wave by several folds. Of course, this was under the effect of Beast Transformation Armor.</p>
 <p>This time, Luo-Li’s matter had been settled quickly. Qing Shui had originally thought that it required a lot more time, he had not foreseen it being dealt with so quickly. After one week's’ time, Qing Shui had members of the Qing Clan cultivate even more. Little Fatty was also staying at the Qing Clan’s residence.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui decided he would fly towards Duanmu City. It was about the right time to visit them since he had been here for awhile. Almost two years had passed since his last visit, though two years on the World of the Nine Continents was not much. However, he felt the pressure of time as he had made plans.</p>
 <p>By himself, Qing Shui’s speed would be fast. Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew Nine Continents Steps requirement to level up was to use it a lot. Thus, Qing Shui had been using Nine Continents Steps every day. He would travel to one place and immediately return. These two trips would perfectly spend the one cycle of Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>Arriving at Duanmu manor, the guard had not changed. Without much effort, he had recognized Qing Shui immediately. One person walked up to greet while the other person walked towards Duanmu manor.</p>
 <p>“Mister Qing!”</p>
 <p>“Is the Lady in?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes, I will lead you there!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hand, “I will go there myself!”</p>
 <p>Entering the Duanmu mansion, there were not many noticeable changes. In the spacious courtyard there were several people, all of which were members of the Duanmu Clan. However, Qing Shui had not detected any formidable energy.</p>
 <p>Just before entering the backyard he had seen the guard from earlier. After greeting Qing Shui again the guard left. Once Qing Shui entered the familiar backyard, he had seen his Lady Duanmu, Yu Ruyan!</p>
 <p>“I missed you!” Qing Shui smiled and walked over.</p>
 <p>Their relationship was a complicated feeling. They had the most intimate moments, but it was at the wrong time. Afterwards, there had never been a chance to meet again. His last departure had already pried open the door to her heart.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan’s blushed unconsciously. This man had matured, even if they were to be together, nobody would say a word. His age range was already equivalent to hers. By appearance alone, no one would be able to tell.</p>
 <p>Before Yu Ruyan had time to respond, her uncertain feelings were softly grasped. She could not help but glare at Qing Shui for an instant. She had been struggling with her feelings for him, but over time, it had slowly changed.</p>
 <p>This change was something she did not dare think of in the past. The incident that had occurred before made her want to die. This man never forced her, but gave her absolute freedom to do what she wanted. Maybe it was because they had both been in a life and death situation, as they say true feelings arise from adversity. His existence had been clearly imprinted in her memory, spirit and body…</p>
 <p>“How come you’re in Central Continent?” Yu Ruyan struggled, but could not break free. She glared at Qing Shui with resentment, but allowed Qing Shui to continue holding her.</p>
 <p>“I miss you, so I came to see you. I’m still waiting for you to marry me.” Qing Shui was smiling, but he was very serious.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan body moved, her expression was unnatural, lowering her head she said: “Qing Shui, I’ve already married once and also have a daughter. How will others see me, see us?”</p>
 <p>“Do you really care how other people will see us? I only want to know if you have me in your heart or not?” Qing Shui asked with panic, he was not sure of the outcome. Though they had known each other for several years, the time they spend seeing each other was little. However, she was a traditional woman. Qing Shui inadvertently broke his way in, else he would have no chance.</p>
