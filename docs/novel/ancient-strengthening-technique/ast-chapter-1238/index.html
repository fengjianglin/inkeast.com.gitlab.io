 <p><strong>AST 1238 - Misunderstanding, State of One with Elephant, It’s Better Than Nothing </strong></p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess has never felt this shocked before. She was embracing a man peacefully for quite a long time. Furthermore, she didn’t notice anything even after being approached by someone with low strength up to such a close distance.</p>
 <p>But at this moment, she no longer had the mood to think about matters like this. Now, she felt a bit incapable of explaining the current situation clearly. The reason being that she was aware that her own sister, Suxin has harbored feelings, or even more so, was fond of Qing Shui. Moreover, she has also tried to give her advice before this. But now, what was she doing herself? Even though she knew that things weren’t the way they thought they were, but her sister would definitely not think that way.</p>
 <p>She would definitely think that her own sister, the Eldest Princess also liked him…… Would she start to assume that her own sister was trying to snatch over the person she liked?</p>
 <p>She let go of Qing Shui very unnaturally. It seemed like Qing Shui also noticed two more people around him. For a moment, he spoke in a slightly awkward tone, “You guys are here.”</p>
 <p>But no one said anything. Yan Jinyu looked at Qing Shui strangely. Her eyes looked really complicated. She seemed to be puzzled.</p>
 <p>The Seventh Princess, on the other hand, looked really unnatural. She stared at the Eldest Princess. Her face expression changed very quickly. From the seventh princess’ look, the Eldest Princess could already tell that she has over thought things. She let out a sigh and said: “Suxin, the only thing I can tell you, is that things aren’t the way you think they are.”</p>
 <p>“What I am thinking, how do you know what I am thinking?” The Seventh Princess looked at Qing Shui and said. Her expression looked really complicated. It was if she was struggling.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, you don’t even believe what your own sister is saying now?” The Eldest Princess was aware that she would most likely not listen to anything she said now.</p>
 <p>“I only believe in what I see. Actually, sister, you don’t really have to explain anything to me. Why didn’t you say so earlier? Sister, you have always loved me dearly. You will give me anything...”</p>
 <p>“What are you guys talking about?” Looking at the seventh princess, Qing Shui could tell quite clearly that the Seventh Princess had started viewing the Eldest Princess differently. As he thought about the things which the Eldest Princess used to tell him before about the Seventh Princess, he finally came to understand what’s going on.</p>
 <p>“Do you like elder sister?” The Seventh Princess smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Why are you asking?” Actually, Qing Shui was also feeling really upset. This world wasn’t that open-minded. Furthermore, what kind of person was the Eldest Princess? For her to embrace another man… If one was to say that they didn’t share any relationships with each other, even Yan Jinyu, or maybe even himself, would most likely be unconvinced by it. But there really was nothing going on. Sometimes, things were just as simple as that.</p>
 <p>“Sister is born with beauty that can topple over countries, moreover, she also plays a very important role in the Royal Family. If you like her, the only thing you can do is to marry her and make her your wife. Can you do that?” The seventh princess looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, that’s enough, what’s wrong with you today?” The Eldest Princess spoke up. She let out her hand and stopped Qing Shui from talking.</p>
 <p>“Sister, I’m just happy to see you falling for someone. Do you know that all along, I have always been feeling that no man is suitable for you? Hence, I’m really happy.” The Seventh Princess said seriously while looking at the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>“You don’t know how to lie. Could it be that the bond we share with each other is unable to bear even tiny matters like this?” The Eldest Princess approached her and asked gently.</p>
 <p>“Sister, I’m wrong!”</p>
 <p>In just a while, the Seventh Princess already went on to hug the Eldest Princess and broke down. She didn’t know why, but she just felt like crying. It’s just like when a child found out that their favorite toy had been taken away by the person closest to them.</p>
 <p>“You aren’t wrong. Let me tell you, at least for now, I don’t have any relationships nor have I made any promises with him.” The Eldest Princess rubbed the seventh princess’ head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected for such ridiculous things to happen to him. He was a bit dumbfounded by it. Furthermore, it was the Seventh Princess and the Eldest Princess. It’s true that the three didn’t share any relationships with each other. Despite this, such kind of misunderstandings could still happen.</p>
 <p>“Sister, I’m sorry… I also don’t know why…”</p>
 <p>“Little brat, it’s better this way, I will only feel sad if you try to hide things from me.” The Eldest Princess let out her hand and wiped off seventh princess’s tears.</p>
 <p>“Sister, do you really like him?” The seventh princess whispered.</p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>“Come on, can you guys stop discussing this matter.” Qing Shui also stunned upon hearing the Eldest Princess’ firm response. In any case, she should have been more tactful.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s all sit down and make things clear. Since Qing Shui is here, we might as well clear things up now. I don’t hope for any estrangement between each other since we are all best friends.” The Eldest Princess said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“What more is there to say? I don’t even like him.” The Seventh Princess said a bit embarrassingly. Prior to this, everyone already noticed something wrong with her.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure?” The Eldest Princess asked while laughing.</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui is someone who is already married. Furthermore, he has more than one wives. You too should never expect him to ever leave them. Little brat, I will take the words which you said before as something which you said out of rage. Do not ever say it again in the future. I wouldn’t stop you from liking someone. In fact, I will help check on him for you. But eventually, it still comes down to your own decision.” The Eldest Princess said gently.</p>
 <p>“I know, sorry.” she apologized to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head and didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>“I am still going to pursue my own happiness. I don’t want to share the same man with someone else.” The Seventh Princess clenched her teeth while looking at Qing Shui. It seemed as if she has made a really huge decision. “Me too!” Yan Jinyu said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected for things to turn out this way. Well, it’s not exactly that bad as it would be less troublesome. All along, love has always been one of the most tiring things. Hence, it would be best for it to be like this.</p>
 <p>“Sister, how about you?” The Seventh Princess looked at the Eldest Princess curiously.</p>
 <p>It’s also only the Seventh Princess who would ask the Eldest Princess questions like this. Only she had the privilege to do so.</p>
 <p>“I am not planning on getting married.” The eldest princess answered while shaking her head. She sounded really firm when she said it.</p>
 <p>Her response really shocked Qing Shui. Even Yan Jinyu was slightly startled by it. The seventh princess, on the other hand, showed a less dramatic reaction than the other two. Instead, she chuckled: “Sister, so you are still insisting on this answer. But I don’t believe you now. I am sure that you will eventually get married in the future.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess didn’t argue back, nor did she admit it. Actually, she also felt a bit shaken deep in her heart. It was a very weird feeling. Time could destroy everything, so could it change everything. It seemed like the things which she used to be really certain in the past has started to waver.</p>
 <p>“Alright, it’s good as long as everything is fine. Next time, you must tell me whatever you are feeling.” The Eldest Princess seemed to have let go of her burden as well.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“What? Qing Shui gave the Saint Child a challenge letter?”</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu and the seventh princess looked at Qing Shui in awe.</p>
 <p>“We will eventually have to fight against each other sooner or later. Wouldn’t it be better if we settle it faster?” Qing Shui pretended to be relaxed when he said this.</p>
 <p>“But he is the Saint Child……”</p>
 <p>“People’s name, tree’s shadow* (Chinese idiom). It was precisely just as stated. A powerful and famous person would instill pressure in people’s hearts, so much so that it would even cause it to misjudge someone. This was a kind of mind trick.</p>
 <p>“So what if he is the Saint Child. Don’t get scared by his name. Nor shall you let down your guard just because your opponent appeared to be an unidentified person who wasn’t famous. A lion would still go all-out when it tries to hunt for a rabbit. One should really be careful to prevent failing miserably at an easy task. If not, they might end up dying without even knowing the reason for it.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the girls.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess sat down quietly by the side and listened while drinking her tea.</p>
 <p>“The Saint Child is way too famous. Are you sure you can beat him?” Yan Jinyu asked skeptically.</p>
 <p>“As long as a person is considered an enemy, it doesn’t matter what kind of reputation, what kind of knowledge and what kind of fame he had. He would still remain an enemy. Against him, the last thing we should do is to retreat. We have to beat him. Of course, you can’t do that by hitting an egg against a stone. Only fools will do that and die for nothing.” Qing Shui explained with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Then Qing Shui, by that, do you mean that you are sure that you will be able to beat him.” Yan Jinyu said in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Nope!” Qing Shui was straightforward with his answer.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu got upset and stared at Qing Shui angrily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, “But I should able to protect myself!”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“Should be able to!”</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu stopped going deeper into the questions. She felt that the more she asked, the more she would worry. For a moment, she felt a bit depressed.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yan, that’s enough. Don’t worry, I am not an impetuous person.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>They left. Qing Shui sat there alone. Deep down, he also felt a lot more relieved. He would rather fight against the Saint Child than face problems in love. He calmed down his mind and started to think of how he should battle Saint Child in the future.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He didn’t plan to refine the powerful energies received back from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. He didn’t want to take such risk. Hence, he could only wait until when his own strength stabled down even more.</p>
 <p>But at the moment when he looked at the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, a bright light shone across his eyes.</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Why would he forget about this?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was so surprised it couldn’t be described with words. If his State of One with Elephant could reach a high realm, the chances of him winning would be even greater.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called upon the Golden Scaled Dragon and immediately jumped onto it. They were high up in the air in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui reminisced the feeling in the past when he used the State of One with Elephant before he began to practice it slowly. After that, he proceeded to control the operation of the Divine Force of both himself and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant to make the two forces merge with each other.</p>
 <p>The low grade of State of One with Elephant only allowed part of the user’s strength with the dragon elephant. It’s said that once it reached a high enough realm, by following the mutual understanding the master and the elephant had for each other as well as the realms they were in, the technique would be amplified under the principle of one plus one equals more than two. Qing Shui was really looking forward to it. He didn’t want to ask for the effect of making the power of one plus one more than two, not even the strength of one plus one equal to two. He would have felt satisfied if he could fuse part of it.</p>
 <p>Attack!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was coordinating his attacks with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant when mounted on its back. This made the attacks of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant to be amplified even more. Prior to this, despite the fact that Qing Shui’s State of One with Elephant not being high in level, it was only considered to be quite average. Now, when he once again practiced it, he also found himself becoming more skilled at it. Furthermore, the pace at which he improved was getting faster and faster. After all, compared to before, Qing Shui’s knowledge, cultivation as well as observation skills were something which couldn’t be put in the same level as those in the past.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Qing Shui seemed like he had forgotten even about time. He would eat some food when he was hungry, sleep when he was tired and unknowingly, the time limit of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was up.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept his calm as he looked at the effect of State of One with Elephant between himself and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. However, the result wasn’t perfect. The reason being that he had not even a single idea of what’s up with the current State of One with Elephant. It could only barely increase the attack prowess of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant up to eleven million nimbus in the State of One With Elephant.</p>
 <p>Previously, the attack prowess of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was slightly more than ten million nimbus. Taking everything into account, it could help increase the strength which the Dragon Elephant unleashed by around a hundred thousand nimbus. Even though the State of One with Elephant was said to make no distinction between the beast and its master, unfortunately, that was something that only could be achieved at an even higher level. Qing Shui’s current State of One with Elephant was yet to achieve that kind of state. For now, the realm of which his State of One With Elephant was in was only limited to either him coordinating to the dragon elephant or the other way around. But now, since the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had stronger physical prowess, Qing Shui could only coordinate himself to its attacks.</p>
 <p>“There is still one more day left. I hope that it will be able to improve a little more. This way, I will have a higher chance of winning.” Qing Shui let out a sigh and left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal after he finished speaking.</p>
 <p>As for refining the energy, Qing Shui would still need a bit more time to do it. He didn’t want to do it now as it was too risky. He planned to refine it only after his strength was completely stable. That way, the risk of it would be decreased by multiple folds. Or else, now would be the moment when he refined it.</p>
